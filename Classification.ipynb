Ludovici.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCTION BY MRS FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW ZARATHUSTRA CAME INTO BEING.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zarathustra\" is my brother\\'s most personal work; it is the history of\\r\\nhis most individual experiences, of his friendships, ideals, raptures,\\r\\nbitterest disappointments and sorrows. Above it all, however, there\\r\\nsoars, transfiguring it, the image of his greatest hopes and remotest\\r\\naims. My brother had the figure of Zarathustra in his mind from his very\\r\\nearliest youth: he once told me that even as a child he had dreamt of\\r\\nhim. At different periods in his life, he would call this haunter of his\\r\\ndreams by different names; \"but in the end,\" he declares in a note on\\r\\nthe subject, \"I had to do a PERSIAN the honour of identifying him with\\r\\nthis creature of my fancy. Persians were the first to take a broad and\\r\\ncomprehensive view of history. Every series of evolutions, according\\r\\nto them, was presided over by a prophet; and every prophet had his\\r\\n\\'Hazar,\\'--his dynasty of a thousand years.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Zarathustra\\'s views, as also his personality, were early conceptions\\r\\nof my brother\\'s mind. Whoever reads his posthumously published writings\\r\\nfor the years 1869-82 with care, will constantly meet with passages\\r\\nsuggestive of Zarathustra\\'s thoughts and doctrines. For instance, the\\r\\nideal of the Superman is put forth quite clearly in all his writings\\r\\nduring the years 1873-75; and in \"We Philologists\", the following\\r\\nremarkable observations occur:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How can one praise and glorify a nation as a whole?--Even among the\\r\\nGreeks, it was the INDIVIDUALS that counted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Greeks are interesting and extremely important because they reared\\r\\nsuch a vast number of great individuals. How was this possible? The\\r\\nquestion is one which ought to be studied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am interested only in the relations of a people to the rearing of\\r\\nthe individual man, and among the Greeks the conditions were unusually\\r\\nfavourable for the development of the individual; not by any means owing\\r\\nto the goodness of the people, but because of the struggles of their\\r\\nevil instincts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WITH THE HELP OF FAVOURABLE MEASURES GREAT INDIVIDUALS MIGHT BE REARED\\r\\nWHO WOULD BE BOTH DIFFERENT FROM AND HIGHER THAN THOSE WHO HERETOFORE\\r\\nHAVE OWED THEIR EXISTENCE TO MERE CHANCE. Here we may still be hopeful:\\r\\nin the rearing of exceptional men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of an ideal\\r\\nNietzsche already had in his youth, that \"THE OBJECT OF MANKIND SHOULD\\r\\nLIE IN ITS HIGHEST INDIVIDUALS\" (or, as he writes in \"Schopenhauer as\\r\\nEducator\": \"Mankind ought constantly to be striving to produce great\\r\\nmen--this and nothing else is its duty.\") But the ideals he most revered\\r\\nin those days are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No,\\r\\naround this future ideal of a coming humanity--the Superman--the poet\\r\\nspread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious heights man\\r\\ncan still ascend? That is why, after having tested the worth of our\\r\\nnoblest ideal--that of the Saviour, in the light of the new valuations,\\r\\nthe poet cries with passionate emphasis in \"Zarathustra\":\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,\\r\\nthe greatest and the smallest man:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAll-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the greatest\\r\\nfound I--all-too-human!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase \"the rearing of the Superman,\" has very often been\\r\\nmisunderstood. By the word \"rearing,\" in this case, is meant the act of\\r\\nmodifying by means of new and higher values--values which, as laws and\\r\\nguides of conduct and opinion, are now to rule over mankind. In general\\r\\nthe doctrine of the Superman can only be understood correctly in\\r\\nconjunction with other ideas of the author\\'s, such as:--the Order\\r\\nof Rank, the Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of all Values. He\\r\\nassumes that Christianity, as a product of the resentment of the botched\\r\\nand the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, strong, proud, and\\r\\npowerful, in fact all the qualities resulting from strength, and that,\\r\\nin consequence, all forces which tend to promote or elevate life have\\r\\nbeen seriously undermined. Now, however, a new table of valuations\\r\\nmust be placed over mankind--namely, that of the strong, mighty, and\\r\\nmagnificent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith--the\\r\\nSuperman, who is now put before us with overpowering passion as the\\r\\naim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the old system of valuing,\\r\\nwhich only extolled the qualities favourable to the weak, the suffering,\\r\\nand the oppressed, has succeeded in producing a weak, suffering, and\\r\\n\"modern\" race, so this new and reversed system of valuing ought to rear\\r\\na healthy, strong, lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory\\r\\nto life itself. Stated briefly, the leading principle of this new system\\r\\nof valuing would be: \"All that proceeds from power is good, all that\\r\\nsprings from weakness is bad.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not a\\r\\nnebulous hope which is to be realised at some indefinitely remote\\r\\nperiod, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species (in the\\r\\nDarwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and which it would\\r\\ntherefore be somewhat absurd to strive after. But it is meant to be\\r\\na possibility which men of the present could realise with all their\\r\\nspiritual and physical energies, provided they adopted the new values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author of \"Zarathustra\" never lost sight of that egregious example\\r\\nof a transvaluation of all values through Christianity, whereby the\\r\\nwhole of the deified mode of life and thought of the Greeks, as well as\\r\\nstrong Romedom, was almost annihilated or transvalued in a comparatively\\r\\nshort time. Could not a rejuvenated Graeco-Roman system of valuing (once\\r\\nit had been refined and made more profound by the schooling which\\r\\ntwo thousand years of Christianity had provided) effect another such\\r\\nrevolution within a calculable period of time, until that glorious type\\r\\nof manhood shall finally appear which is to be our new faith and hope,\\r\\nand in the creation of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his private notes on the subject the author uses the expression\\r\\n\"Superman\" (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as signifying \"the most\\r\\nthoroughly well-constituted type,\" as opposed to \"modern man\"; above\\r\\nall, however, he designates Zarathustra himself as an example of the\\r\\nSuperman. In \"Ecco Homo\" he is careful to enlighten us concerning the\\r\\nprecursors and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in\\r\\nreferring to a certain passage in the \"Gay Science\":--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear in\\r\\nregard to the leading physiological condition on which it depends: this\\r\\ncondition is what I call GREAT HEALTHINESS. I know not how to express my\\r\\nmeaning more plainly or more personally than I have done already in\\r\\none of the last chapters (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of the \\'Gaya\\r\\nScienza\\'.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-understand,\"--it says\\r\\nthere,--\"we firstlings of a yet untried future--we require for a new end\\r\\nalso a new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher,\\r\\nbolder and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul\\r\\nlongeth to experience the whole range of hitherto recognised values\\r\\nand desirabilities, and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal\\r\\n\\'Mediterranean Sea\\', who, from the adventures of his most personal\\r\\nexperience, wants to know how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer\\r\\nof the ideal--as likewise how it is with the artist, the saint, the\\r\\nlegislator, the sage, the scholar, the devotee, the prophet, and the\\r\\ngodly non-conformist of the old style:--requires one thing above all\\r\\nfor that purpose, GREAT HEALTHINESS--such healthiness as one not only\\r\\npossesses, but also constantly acquires and must acquire, because one\\r\\nunceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it!--And now, after\\r\\nhaving been long on the way in this fashion, we Argonauts of the ideal,\\r\\nmore courageous perhaps than prudent, and often enough shipwrecked\\r\\nand brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously healthy, always healthy\\r\\nagain,--it would seem as if, in recompense for it all, that we have a\\r\\nstill undiscovered country before us, the boundaries of which no one\\r\\nhas yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of the ideal known\\r\\nhitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the strange, the\\r\\nquestionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity as well\\r\\nas our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand--alas! that\\r\\nnothing will now any longer satisfy us!--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could we still be content with THE MAN OF THE PRESENT DAY\\r\\nafter such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and\\r\\nconsciousness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look\\r\\non the worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present day with\\r\\nill-concealed amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them.\\r\\nAnother ideal runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of\\r\\ndanger, to which we should not like to persuade any one, because we\\r\\ndo not so readily acknowledge any one\\'s RIGHT THERETO: the ideal of\\r\\na spirit who plays naively (that is to say involuntarily and from\\r\\noverflowing abundance and power) with everything that has hitherto\\r\\nbeen called holy, good, intangible, or divine; to whom the loftiest\\r\\nconception which the people have reasonably made their measure of value,\\r\\nwould already practically imply danger, ruin, abasement, or at least\\r\\nrelaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetfulness; the ideal of\\r\\na humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which will often enough\\r\\nappear INHUMAN, for example, when put alongside of all past seriousness\\r\\non earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bearing, word, tone,\\r\\nlook, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary parody--and\\r\\nWITH which, nevertheless, perhaps THE GREAT SERIOUSNESS only commences,\\r\\nwhen the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the soul\\r\\nchanges, the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of the leading\\r\\nthoughts in this work had appeared much earlier in the dreams and\\r\\nwritings of the author, \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" did not actually come\\r\\ninto being until the month of August 1881 in Sils Maria; and it was the\\r\\nidea of the Eternal Recurrence of all things which finally induced my\\r\\nbrother to set forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his\\r\\nfirst conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, \"Ecce Homo\",\\r\\nwritten in the autumn of 1888, contains the following passage:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The fundamental idea of my work--namely, the Eternal Recurrence of\\r\\nall things--this highest of all possible formulae of a Yea-saying\\r\\nphilosophy, first occurred to me in August 1881. I made a note of the\\r\\nthought on a sheet of paper, with the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond\\r\\nmen and time! That day I happened to be wandering through the woods\\r\\nalongside of the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge,\\r\\npyramidal and towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the\\r\\nthought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two months\\r\\nprevious to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its coming in the\\r\\nform of a sudden and decisive alteration in my tastes--more particularly\\r\\nin music. It would even be possible to consider all \\'Zarathustra\\' as a\\r\\nmusical composition. At all events, a very necessary condition in its\\r\\nproduction was a renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small\\r\\nmountain resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of\\r\\n1881, I and my friend and Maestro, Peter Gast--also one who had been\\r\\nborn again--discovered that the phoenix music that hovered over us, wore\\r\\nlighter and brighter plumes than it had done theretofore.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the month of August 1881 my brother resolved to reveal the\\r\\nteaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic and psalmodic form,\\r\\nthrough the mouth of Zarathustra. Among the notes of this period, we\\r\\nfound a page on which is written the first definite plan of \"Thus Spake\\r\\nZarathustra\":--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"MIDDAY AND ETERNITY.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath this is written:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year,\\r\\nwent into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the\\r\\nmountains, composed the Zend-Avesta.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent\\r\\nof eternity lies coiled in its light--: It is YOUR time, ye midday\\r\\nbrethren.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of steadily\\r\\ndeclining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this first gush\\r\\nof the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition that we owe not\\r\\nonly \"The Gay Science\", which in its mood may be regarded as a prelude\\r\\nto \"Zarathustra\", but also \"Zarathustra\" itself. Just as he was\\r\\nbeginning to recuperate his health, however, an unkind destiny brought\\r\\nhim a number of most painful personal experiences. His friends caused\\r\\nhim many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, inasmuch as\\r\\nhe regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; and for the first\\r\\ntime in his life he realised the whole horror of that loneliness to\\r\\nwhich, perhaps, all greatness is condemned. But to be forsaken is\\r\\nsomething very different from deliberately choosing blessed loneliness.\\r\\nHow he longed, in those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly\\r\\nunderstand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he\\r\\nimagined he had found at various periods in his life from his earliest\\r\\nyouth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had chosen grew ever more\\r\\nperilous and steep, he found nobody who could follow him: he therefore\\r\\ncreated a perfect friend for himself in the ideal form of a majestic\\r\\nphilosopher, and made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether my brother would ever have written \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\"\\r\\naccording to the first plan sketched in the summer of 1881, if he\\r\\nhad not had the disappointments already referred to, is now an idle\\r\\nquestion; but perhaps where \"Zarathustra\" is concerned, we may also say\\r\\nwith Master Eckhardt: \"The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is\\r\\nsuffering.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother writes as follows about the origin of the first part of\\r\\n\"Zarathustra\":--\"In the winter of 1882-83, I was living on the charming\\r\\nlittle Gulf of Rapallo, not far from Genoa, and between Chiavari and\\r\\nCape Porto Fino. My health was not very good; the winter was cold and\\r\\nexceptionally rainy; and the small inn in which I lived was so close\\r\\nto the water that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were\\r\\nhigh. These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favourable;\\r\\nand yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief that\\r\\neverything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, it was\\r\\nprecisely during this winter and in the midst of these unfavourable\\r\\ncircumstances that my \\'Zarathustra\\' originated. In the morning I used to\\r\\nstart out in a southerly direction up the glorious road to Zoagli, which\\r\\nrises aloft through a forest of pines and gives one a view far out into\\r\\nthe sea. In the afternoon, as often as my health permitted, I walked\\r\\nround the whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This\\r\\nspot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so dearly\\r\\nloved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 1886 I chanced to\\r\\nbe there again when he was revisiting this small, forgotten world\\r\\nof happiness for the last time. It was on these two roads that all\\r\\n\\'Zarathustra\\' came to me, above all Zarathustra himself as a type;--I\\r\\nought rather to say that it was on these walks that these ideas waylaid\\r\\nme.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first part of \"Zarathustra\" was written in about ten days--that is\\r\\nto say, from the beginning to about the middle of February 1883. \"The\\r\\nlast lines were written precisely in the hallowed hour when Richard\\r\\nWagner gave up the ghost in Venice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the ten days occupied in composing the first part\\r\\nof this book, my brother often referred to this winter as the hardest\\r\\nand sickliest he had ever experienced. He did not, however, mean thereby\\r\\nthat his former disorders were troubling him, but that he was suffering\\r\\nfrom a severe attack of influenza which he had caught in Santa\\r\\nMargherita, and which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival\\r\\nin Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of most was\\r\\nhis spiritual condition--that indescribable forsakenness--to which he\\r\\ngives such heartrending expression in \"Zarathustra\". Even the reception\\r\\nwhich the first part met with at the hands of friends and acquaintances\\r\\nwas extremely disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented\\r\\ncopies of the work misunderstood it. \"I found no one ripe for many of my\\r\\nthoughts; the case of \\'Zarathustra\\' proves that one can speak with the\\r\\nutmost clearness, and yet not be heard by any one.\" My brother was very\\r\\nmuch discouraged by the feebleness of the response he was given, and as\\r\\nhe was striving just then to give up the practice of taking hydrate\\r\\nof chloral--a drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza,--the\\r\\nfollowing spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one for him.\\r\\nHe writes about it as follows:--\"I spent a melancholy spring in Rome,\\r\\nwhere I only just managed to live,--and this was no easy matter. This\\r\\ncity, which is absolutely unsuited to the poet-author of \\'Zarathustra\\',\\r\\nand for the choice of which I was not responsible, made me inordinately\\r\\nmiserable. I tried to leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila--the opposite\\r\\nof Rome in every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity\\r\\ntowards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day), as a\\r\\nmemento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church--a person very\\r\\nclosely related to me,--the great Hohenstaufen, the Emperor Frederick\\r\\nII. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to return again to Rome. In the\\r\\nend I was obliged to be satisfied with the Piazza Barberini, after I had\\r\\nexerted myself in vain to find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that\\r\\non one occasion, to avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually\\r\\ninquired at the Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a\\r\\nquiet room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza just\\r\\nmentioned, from which one obtained a general view of Rome and could\\r\\nhear the fountains plashing far below, the loneliest of all songs\\r\\nwas composed--\\'The Night-Song\\'. About this time I was obsessed by an\\r\\nunspeakably sad melody, the refrain of which I recognised in the words,\\r\\n\\'dead through immortality.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and what with the\\r\\neffect of the increasing heat and the discouraging circumstances already\\r\\ndescribed, my brother resolved not to write any more, or in any case,\\r\\nnot to proceed with \"Zarathustra\", although I offered to relieve him\\r\\nof all trouble in connection with the proofs and the publisher. When,\\r\\nhowever, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and he\\r\\nfound himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating air of the\\r\\nmountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and in a note to me\\r\\nannouncing the dispatch of some manuscript, he wrote as follows: \"I have\\r\\nengaged a place here for three months: forsooth, I am the greatest fool\\r\\nto allow my courage to be sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now\\r\\nand again I am troubled by the thought: WHAT NEXT? My \\'future\\' is the\\r\\ndarkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a great\\r\\ndeal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of doing this than\\r\\nof my future, and leave the rest to THEE and the gods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second part of \"Zarathustra\" was written between the 26th of June\\r\\nand the 6th July. \"This summer, finding myself once more in the sacred\\r\\nplace where the first thought of \\'Zarathustra\\' flashed across my mind,\\r\\nI conceived the second part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second,\\r\\nthe first, nor the third part, have I required a day longer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he wrote\\r\\n\"Zarathustra\"; how in his walks over hill and dale the ideas would crowd\\r\\ninto his mind, and how he would note them down hastily in a note-book\\r\\nfrom which he would transcribe them on his return, sometimes working\\r\\ntill midnight. He says in a letter to me: \"You can have no idea of the\\r\\nvehemence of such composition,\" and in \"Ecce Homo\" (autumn 1888) he\\r\\ndescribes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incomparable mood in\\r\\nwhich he created Zarathustra:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"--Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any distinct notion\\r\\nof what poets of a stronger age understood by the word inspiration? If\\r\\nnot, I will describe it. If one had the smallest vestige of superstition\\r\\nin one, it would hardly be possible to set aside completely the idea\\r\\nthat one is the mere incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty\\r\\npower. The idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes\\r\\nsuddenly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and accuracy,\\r\\nwhich profoundly convulses and upsets one--describes simply the matter\\r\\nof fact. One hears--one does not seek; one takes--one does not ask\\r\\nwho gives: a thought suddenly flashes up like lightning, it comes with\\r\\nnecessity, unhesitatingly--I have never had any choice in the matter.\\r\\nThere is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes\\r\\nrelaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one\\'s steps either rush\\r\\nor involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that one is\\r\\ncompletely out of hand, with the very distinct consciousness of an\\r\\nendless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the very toes;--there\\r\\nis a depth of happiness in which the painfullest and gloomiest do not\\r\\noperate as antitheses, but as conditioned, as demanded in the sense of\\r\\nnecessary shades of colour in such an overflow of light. There is an\\r\\ninstinct for rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms\\r\\n(length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the measure of\\r\\nthe force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart to its pressure and\\r\\ntension). Everything happens quite involuntarily, as if in a tempestuous\\r\\noutburst of freedom, of absoluteness, of power and divinity. The\\r\\ninvoluntariness of the figures and similes is the most remarkable\\r\\nthing; one loses all perception of what constitutes the figure and\\r\\nwhat constitutes the simile; everything seems to present itself as\\r\\nthe readiest, the correctest and the simplest means of expression.\\r\\nIt actually seems, to use one of Zarathustra\\'s own phrases, as if all\\r\\nthings came unto one, and would fain be similes: \\'Here do all things\\r\\ncome caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to ride\\r\\nupon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to every truth. Here\\r\\nfly open unto thee all being\\'s words and word-cabinets; here all being\\r\\nwanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how\\r\\nto talk.\\' This is MY experience of inspiration. I do not doubt but that\\r\\none would have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one\\r\\nwho could say to me: It is mine also!--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for Germany and\\r\\nstayed there a few weeks. In the following winter, after wandering\\r\\nsomewhat erratically through Stresa, Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in\\r\\nNice, where the climate so happily promoted his creative powers that\\r\\nhe wrote the third part of \"Zarathustra\". \"In the winter, beneath the\\r\\nhalcyon sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first time\\r\\nin my life, I found the third \\'Zarathustra\\'--and came to the end of my\\r\\ntask; the whole having occupied me scarcely a year. Many hidden corners\\r\\nand heights in the landscapes round about Nice are hallowed to me by\\r\\nunforgettable moments. That decisive chapter entitled \\'Old and New\\r\\nTables\\' was composed in the very difficult ascent from the station\\r\\nto Eza--that wonderful Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative\\r\\nmoments were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The body\\r\\nis inspired: let us waive the question of the \\'soul.\\' I might often have\\r\\nbeen seen dancing in those days. Without a suggestion of fatigue I could\\r\\nthen walk for seven or eight hours on end among the hills. I slept well\\r\\nand laughed well--I was perfectly robust and patient.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have seen, each of the three parts of \"Zarathustra\" was written,\\r\\nafter a more or less short period of preparation, in about ten days.\\r\\nThe composition of the fourth part alone was broken by occasional\\r\\ninterruptions. The first notes relating to this part were written while\\r\\nhe and I were staying together in Zurich in September 1884. In the\\r\\nfollowing November, while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate\\r\\nthese notes, and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice\\r\\nbetween the end of January and the middle of February 1885. My brother\\r\\nthen called this part the fourth and last; but even before, and shortly\\r\\nafter it had been privately printed, he wrote to me saying that he still\\r\\nintended writing a fifth and sixth part, and notes relating to these\\r\\nparts are now in my possession. This fourth part (the original MS. of\\r\\nwhich contains this note: \"Only for my friends, not for the public\")\\r\\nis written in a particularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he\\r\\npresented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concerning\\r\\nits contents. He often thought of making this fourth part public also,\\r\\nbut doubted whether he would ever be able to do so without considerably\\r\\naltering certain portions of it. At all events he resolved to distribute\\r\\nthis manuscript production, of which only forty copies were printed,\\r\\nonly among those who had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks\\r\\neloquently of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days,\\r\\nthat he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book according\\r\\nto this resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready at the beginning of this history I hinted at the reasons which\\r\\nled my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation of his ideal of\\r\\nthe majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, for choosing Zarathustra\\r\\nof all others to be his mouthpiece, he gives us in the following\\r\\nwords:--\"People have never asked me, as they should have done, what the\\r\\nname Zarathustra precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first\\r\\nImmoralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all others\\r\\nin the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse of an\\r\\nimmoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between\\r\\ngood and evil the essential wheel in the working of things. The\\r\\ntranslation of morality into the metaphysical, as force, cause, end in\\r\\nitself, was HIS work. But the very question suggests its own answer.\\r\\nZarathustra CREATED the most portentous error, MORALITY, consequently he\\r\\nshould also be the first to PERCEIVE that error, not only because he\\r\\nhas had longer and greater experience of the subject than any other\\r\\nthinker--all history is the experimental refutation of the theory of\\r\\nthe so-called moral order of things:--the more important point is that\\r\\nZarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker. In his teaching\\r\\nalone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the highest virtue--i.e.:\\r\\nthe reverse of the COWARDICE of the \\'idealist\\' who flees from reality.\\r\\nZarathustra had more courage in his body than any other thinker before\\r\\nor after him. To tell the truth and TO AIM STRAIGHT: that is the first\\r\\nPersian virtue. Am I understood?... The overcoming of morality through\\r\\nitself--through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist through his\\r\\nopposite--THROUGH ME--: that is what the name Zarathustra means in my\\r\\nmouth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nELIZABETH FORSTER-NIETZSCHE.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche Archives,\\r\\n\\r\\nWeimar, December 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST PART. ZARATHUSTRA\\'S DISCOURSES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZARATHUSTRA\\'S PROLOGUE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of\\r\\nhis home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and\\r\\nsolitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart\\r\\nchanged,--and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the\\r\\nsun, and spake thus unto it:\\r\\n\\r\\nThou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for\\r\\nwhom thou shinest!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have\\r\\nwearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine\\r\\neagle, and my serpent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and\\r\\nblessed thee for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much\\r\\nhoney; I need hands outstretched to take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become\\r\\njoyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the\\r\\nevening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the\\r\\nnether-world, thou exuberant star!\\r\\n\\r\\nLike thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\\r\\n\\r\\nBless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest\\r\\nhappiness without envy!\\r\\n\\r\\nBless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden\\r\\nout of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again\\r\\ngoing to be a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus began Zarathustra\\'s down-going.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him. When he\\r\\nentered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man,\\r\\nwho had left his holy cot to seek roots. And thus spake the old man to\\r\\nZarathustra:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed he by.\\r\\nZarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt thou now carry\\r\\nthy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the incendiary\\'s doom?\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, I recognise Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh\\r\\nabout his mouth. Goeth he not along like a dancer?\\r\\n\\r\\nAltered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an awakened one\\r\\nis Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up.\\r\\nAlas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body\\r\\nthyself?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra answered: \"I love mankind.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why,\" said the saint, \"did I go into the forest and the desert? Was it\\r\\nnot because I loved men far too well?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too imperfect for me.\\r\\nLove to man would be fatal to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra answered: \"What spake I of love! I am bringing gifts unto\\r\\nmen.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give them nothing,\" said the saint. \"Take rather part of their load,\\r\\nand carry it along with them--that will be most agreeable unto them: if\\r\\nonly it be agreeable unto thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more than an alms,\\r\\nand let them also beg for it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No,\" replied Zarathustra, \"I give no alms. I am not poor enough for\\r\\nthat.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: \"Then see to it that\\r\\nthey accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and do\\r\\nnot believe that we come with gifts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And\\r\\njust as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before\\r\\nsunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief?\\r\\n\\r\\nGo not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not\\r\\nbe like me--a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what doeth the saint in the forest?\" asked Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saint answered: \"I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns I\\r\\nlaugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise God.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise the God who is\\r\\nmy God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said:\\r\\n\"What should I have to give thee! Let me rather hurry hence lest I take\\r\\naught away from thee!\"--And thus they parted from one another, the old\\r\\nman and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: \"Could it be\\r\\npossible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet heard of it, that\\r\\nGOD IS DEAD!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest,\\r\\nhe found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been\\r\\nannounced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. And Zarathustra\\r\\nspake thus unto the people:\\r\\n\\r\\nI TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed. What\\r\\nhave ye done to surpass man?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye\\r\\nwant to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the\\r\\nbeast than surpass man?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just the\\r\\nsame shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still\\r\\nworm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of\\r\\nthe apes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and\\r\\nphantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, I teach you the Superman!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The\\r\\nSuperman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nI conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not\\r\\nthose who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they,\\r\\nwhether they know it or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves,\\r\\nof whom the earth is weary: so away with them!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died,\\r\\nand therewith also those blasphemers. To blaspheme the earth is now the\\r\\ndreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the\\r\\nmeaning of the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt\\r\\nwas the supreme thing:--the soul wished the body meagre, ghastly, and\\r\\nfamished. Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was\\r\\nthe delight of that soul!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say about\\r\\nyour soul? Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched\\r\\nself-complacency?\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to receive a\\r\\npolluted stream without becoming impure.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your great\\r\\ncontempt be submerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour of great\\r\\ncontempt. The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto\\r\\nyou, and so also your reason and virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my happiness! It is poverty and\\r\\npollution and wretched self-complacency. But my happiness should justify\\r\\nexistence itself!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my reason! Doth it long for\\r\\nknowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and pollution and\\r\\nwretched self-complacency!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my virtue! As yet it hath not made\\r\\nme passionate. How weary I am of my good and my bad! It is all poverty\\r\\nand pollution and wretched self-complacency!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my justice! I do not see that I am\\r\\nfervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour and fuel!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour when ye say: \"What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on\\r\\nwhich he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! would that I had\\r\\nheard you crying thus!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not your sin--it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto\\r\\nheaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy\\r\\nwith which ye should be inoculated?\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: \"We have\\r\\nnow heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!\"\\r\\nAnd all the people laughed at Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who\\r\\nthought the words applied to him, began his performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. Then he spake\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman--a rope over\\r\\nan abyss.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a\\r\\ndangerous trembling and halting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal: what is\\r\\nlovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they\\r\\nare the over-goers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and\\r\\narrows of longing for the other shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going\\r\\ndown and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that\\r\\nthe earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in\\r\\norder that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own\\r\\ndown-going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for\\r\\nthe Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant: for thus\\r\\nseeketh he his own down-going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to down-going,\\r\\nand an arrow of longing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to\\r\\nbe wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he as spirit over the\\r\\nbridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: thus, for\\r\\nthe sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is more of a\\r\\nvirtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one\\'s destiny to cling\\r\\nto.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give\\r\\nback: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then\\r\\nasketh: \"Am I a dishonest player?\"--for he is willing to succumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and\\r\\nalways doeth more than he promiseth: for he seeketh his own down-going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones:\\r\\nfor he is willing to succumb through the present ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God: for he\\r\\nmust succumb through the wrath of his God.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb\\r\\nthrough a small matter: thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all\\r\\nthings are in him: thus all things become his down-going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his\\r\\nhead only the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his\\r\\ndown-going.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark\\r\\ncloud that lowereth over man: they herald the coming of the lightning,\\r\\nand succumb as heralds.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:\\r\\nthe lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.--\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people,\\r\\nand was silent. \"There they stand,\" said he to his heart; \"there they\\r\\nlaugh: they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their\\r\\neyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers? Or do\\r\\nthey only believe the stammerer?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have something whereof they are proud. What do they call it, that\\r\\nwhich maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them\\r\\nfrom the goatherds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey dislike, therefore, to hear of \\'contempt\\' of themselves. So I will\\r\\nappeal to their pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing: that, however, is\\r\\nTHE LAST MAN!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant the germ\\r\\nof his highest hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day be\\r\\npoor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow\\r\\nthereon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of\\r\\nhis longing beyond man--and the string of his bow will have unlearned to\\r\\nwhizz!\\r\\n\\r\\nI tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing\\r\\nstar. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any\\r\\nstar. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no\\r\\nlonger despise himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! I show you THE LAST MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\"--so\\r\\nasketh the last man and blinketh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man\\r\\nwho maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of\\r\\nthe ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have discovered happiness\"--say the last men, and blink thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need\\r\\nwarmth. One still loveth one\\'s neighbour and rubbeth against him; for\\r\\none needeth warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they walk\\r\\nwarily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!\\r\\n\\r\\nA little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. And much\\r\\npoison at last for a pleasant death.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the\\r\\npastime should hurt one.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still\\r\\nwanteth to rule? Who still wanteth to obey? Both are too burdensome.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo shepherd, and one herd! Every one wanteth the same; every one is\\r\\nequal: he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Formerly all the world was insane,\"--say the subtlest of them, and\\r\\nblink thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are clever and know all that hath happened: so there is\\r\\nno end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon\\r\\nreconciled--otherwise it spoileth their stomachs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures\\r\\nfor the night, but they have a regard for health.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have discovered happiness,\"--say the last men, and blink thereby.--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also\\r\\ncalled \"The Prologue\": for at this point the shouting and mirth of the\\r\\nmultitude interrupted him. \"Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,\"--they\\r\\ncalled out--\"make us into these last men! Then will we make thee a\\r\\npresent of the Superman!\" And all the people exulted and smacked their\\r\\nlips. Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I\\r\\nhearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak unto them as unto\\r\\nthe goatherds.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning. But they\\r\\nthink me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now do they look at me and laugh: and while they laugh they hate me\\r\\ntoo. There is ice in their laughter.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every\\r\\neye fixed. In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his\\r\\nperformance: he had come out at a little door, and was going along the\\r\\nrope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the\\r\\nmarket-place and the people. When he was just midway across, the little\\r\\ndoor opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon\\r\\nsprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. \"Go on, halt-foot,\"\\r\\ncried his frightful voice, \"go on, lazy-bones, interloper,\\r\\nsallow-face!--lest I tickle thee with my heel! What dost thou here\\r\\nbetween the towers? In the tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be\\r\\nlocked up; to one better than thyself thou blockest the way!\"--And with\\r\\nevery word he came nearer and nearer the first one. When, however, he\\r\\nwas but a step behind, there happened the frightful thing which made\\r\\nevery mouth mute and every eye fixed--he uttered a yell like a devil,\\r\\nand jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, however, when\\r\\nhe thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same time his head and his\\r\\nfooting on the rope; he threw his pole away, and shot downwards faster\\r\\nthan it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the depth. The market-place\\r\\nand the people were like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew\\r\\napart and in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the\\r\\nbody, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead. After a while\\r\\nconsciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra\\r\\nkneeling beside him. \"What art thou doing there?\" said he at last, \"I\\r\\nknew long ago that the devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to\\r\\nhell: wilt thou prevent him?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On mine honour, my friend,\" answered Zarathustra, \"there is nothing of\\r\\nall that whereof thou speakest: there is no devil and no hell. Thy soul\\r\\nwill be dead even sooner than thy body: fear, therefore, nothing any\\r\\nmore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man looked up distrustfully. \"If thou speakest the truth,\" said he,\\r\\n\"I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than an animal\\r\\nwhich hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not at all,\" said Zarathustra, \"thou hast made danger thy calling;\\r\\ntherein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou perishest by thy\\r\\ncalling: therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but\\r\\nhe moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in\\r\\ngloom. Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become\\r\\nfatigued. Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the\\r\\nground, absorbed in thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it\\r\\nbecame night, and a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose\\r\\nZarathustra and said to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is not a\\r\\nman he hath caught, but a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon may be\\r\\nfateful to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman,\\r\\nthe lightning out of the dark cloud--man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their\\r\\nsense. To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nGloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. Come, thou cold\\r\\nand stiff companion! I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee\\r\\nwith mine own hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his\\r\\nshoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he not gone a hundred steps,\\r\\nwhen there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear--and lo!\\r\\nhe that spake was the buffoon from the tower. \"Leave this town, O\\r\\nZarathustra,\" said he, \"there are too many here who hate thee. The\\r\\ngood and just hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the\\r\\nbelievers in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to\\r\\nthe multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily thou\\r\\nspakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate with the\\r\\ndead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved thy life to-day.\\r\\nDepart, however, from this town,--or tomorrow I shall jump over thee,\\r\\na living man over a dead one.\" And when he had said this, the buffoon\\r\\nvanished; Zarathustra, however, went on through the dark streets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their\\r\\ntorch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided\\r\\nhim. \"Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that\\r\\nZarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly\\r\\nfor that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well\\r\\nthen, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief\\r\\nthan Zarathustra!--he will steal them both, he will eat them both!\" And\\r\\nthey laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had\\r\\ngone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of\\r\\nthe hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he\\r\\nhalted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hunger attacketh me,\" said Zarathustra, \"like a robber. Among forests\\r\\nand swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a\\r\\nrepast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old man\\r\\nappeared, who carried a light, and asked: \"Who cometh unto me and my bad\\r\\nsleep?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A living man and a dead one,\" said Zarathustra. \"Give me something to\\r\\neat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry\\r\\nrefresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra\\r\\nbread and wine. \"A bad country for the hungry,\" said he; \"that is why\\r\\nI live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy\\r\\ncompanion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.\" Zarathustra\\r\\nanswered: \"My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him\\r\\nto eat.\" \"That doth not concern me,\" said the old man sullenly; \"he\\r\\nthat knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, and fare ye\\r\\nwell!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path\\r\\nand the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and\\r\\nliked to look into the face of all that slept. When the morning dawned,\\r\\nhowever, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no path was\\r\\nany longer visible. He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his\\r\\nhead--for he wanted to protect him from the wolves--and laid himself\\r\\ndown on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, tired in\\r\\nbody, but with a tranquil soul.\\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head,\\r\\nbut also the morning. At last, however, his eyes opened, and amazedly he\\r\\ngazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed into himself.\\r\\nThen he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land;\\r\\nand he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his\\r\\nheart:\\r\\n\\r\\nA light hath dawned upon me: I need companions--living ones; not dead\\r\\ncompanions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to\\r\\nfollow themselves--and to the place where I will.\\r\\n\\r\\nA light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak,\\r\\nbut to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd\\'s herdsman and\\r\\nhound!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo allure many from the herd--for that purpose have I come. The people\\r\\nand the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called\\r\\nby the herdsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHerdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. Herdsmen, I\\r\\nsay, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up\\r\\ntheir tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker:--he, however, is\\r\\nthe creator.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who\\r\\nbreaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker--he,\\r\\nhowever, is the creator.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanions, the creator seeketh, not corpses--and not herds or believers\\r\\neither. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh--those who grave new values\\r\\non new tables.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is\\r\\nripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he\\r\\nplucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their\\r\\nsickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and\\r\\nevil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and\\r\\nfellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and\\r\\nherdsmen and corpses!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee in\\r\\nthy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I part from thee; the time hath arrived. \\'Twixt rosy dawn and rosy\\r\\ndawn there came unto me a new truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more\\r\\nwill I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto\\r\\nthe dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the\\r\\nrainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers;\\r\\nand unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart\\r\\nheavy with my happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy\\r\\nwill I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noon-tide.\\r\\nThen he looked inquiringly aloft,--for he heard above him the sharp call\\r\\nof a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide circles,\\r\\nand on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it\\r\\nkept itself coiled round the eagle\\'s neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are mine animals,\" said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the\\r\\nsun,--they have come out to reconnoitre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I still\\r\\nlive?\\r\\n\\r\\nMore dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in\\r\\ndangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in\\r\\nthe forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart,\\r\\nlike my serpent!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go always\\r\\nwith my wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if my wisdom should some day forsake me:--alas! it loveth to fly\\r\\naway!--may my pride then fly with my folly!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus began Zarathustra\\'s down-going.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nZARATHUSTRA\\'S DISCOURSES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit\\r\\nbecometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing\\r\\nspirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest\\r\\nlongeth its strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down\\r\\nlike the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit,\\r\\nthat I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one\\'s pride? To\\r\\nexhibit one\\'s folly in order to mock at one\\'s wisdom?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To\\r\\nascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the\\r\\nsake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of\\r\\nthe deaf, who never hear thy requests?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and\\r\\nnot disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one\\'s hand to the\\r\\nphantom when it is going to frighten us?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself:\\r\\nand like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so\\r\\nhasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here\\r\\nthe spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its\\r\\nown wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its\\r\\nlast God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call\\r\\nLord and God? \"Thou-shalt,\" is the great dragon called. But the spirit\\r\\nof the lion saith, \"I will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou-shalt,\" lieth in its path, sparkling with gold--a scale-covered\\r\\nbeast; and on every scale glittereth golden, \"Thou shalt!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and\\r\\nthus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: \"All the values of\\r\\nthings--glitter on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll values have already been created, and all created values--do I\\r\\nrepresent. Verily, there shall be no \\'I will\\' any more. Thus speaketh\\r\\nthe dragon.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why\\r\\nsufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create new values--that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to\\r\\ncreate itself freedom for new creating--that can the might of the lion\\r\\ndo.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that,\\r\\nmy brethren, there is need of the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo assume the right to new values--that is the most formidable\\r\\nassumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a\\r\\nspirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs its holiest, it once loved \"Thou-shalt\": now is it forced to find\\r\\nillusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may\\r\\ncapture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion\\r\\ncould not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child?\\r\\n\\r\\nInnocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a\\r\\nself-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea\\r\\nunto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth\\r\\nthe world\\'s outcast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the\\r\\nspirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is\\r\\ncalled The Pied Cow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse\\r\\nwell about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for\\r\\nit, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra,\\r\\nand sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:\\r\\n\\r\\nRespect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And\\r\\nto go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!\\r\\n\\r\\nModest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly\\r\\nthrough the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly\\r\\nhe carrieth his horn.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep\\r\\nawake all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome\\r\\nweariness, and is poppy to the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is\\r\\nbitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth\\r\\nduring the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.\\r\\n\\r\\nTen times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy\\r\\nstomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep\\r\\nwell. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?\\r\\n\\r\\nShall I covet my neighbour\\'s maidservant? All that would ill accord with\\r\\ngood sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful:\\r\\nto send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about\\r\\nthee, thou unhappy one!\\r\\n\\r\\nPeace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also\\r\\nwith thy neighbour\\'s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked\\r\\ngovernment! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to\\r\\nwalk on crooked legs?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me\\r\\nthe best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen.\\r\\nBut it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come\\r\\nand go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed\\r\\nare they, especially if one always give in to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I\\r\\ngood care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned--sleep, the\\r\\nlord of the virtues!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus\\r\\nruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten\\r\\novercomings?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten\\r\\nlaughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?\\r\\n\\r\\nThus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at\\r\\nonce--sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my\\r\\nmouth, and it remaineth open.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and\\r\\nstealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic\\r\\nchair.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart:\\r\\nfor thereby had a light dawned upon him. And thus spake he to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\nA fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he\\r\\nknoweth well how to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is\\r\\ncontagious--even through a thick wall it is contagious.\\r\\n\\r\\nA magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the\\r\\nyouths sit before the preacher of virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if\\r\\nlife had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the\\r\\ndesirablest nonsense for me also.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they\\r\\nsought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and\\r\\npoppy-head virtues to promote it!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep\\r\\nwithout dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of\\r\\nvirtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not\\r\\nmuch longer do they stand: there they already lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. BACKWORLDSMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all\\r\\nbackworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world\\r\\nthen seem to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dream--and diction--of a God, did the world then seem to me;\\r\\ncoloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou--coloured vapours did\\r\\nthey seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away\\r\\nfrom himself,--thereupon he created the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering\\r\\nand forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world\\r\\nonce seem to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction\\'s image\\r\\nand imperfect image--an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:--thus\\r\\ndid the world once seem to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all\\r\\nbackworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human\\r\\nmadness, like all the Gods!\\r\\n\\r\\nA man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own\\r\\nashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not\\r\\nunto me from the beyond!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I\\r\\ncarried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for\\r\\nmyself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe\\r\\nin such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus\\r\\nspeak I to backworldsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuffering was it, and impotence--that created all backworlds; and\\r\\nthe short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer\\r\\nexperienceth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with\\r\\na death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any\\r\\nlonger: that created all Gods and backworlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body--it\\r\\ngroped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the\\r\\nearth--it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head--and\\r\\nnot with its head only--into \"the other world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that \"other world\" is well concealed from man, that dehumanised,\\r\\ninhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence\\r\\ndo not speak unto man, except as man.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak.\\r\\nTell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most\\r\\nuprightly of its being--this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is\\r\\nthe measure and value of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this most upright existence, the ego--it speaketh of the body, and\\r\\nstill implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth\\r\\nwith broken wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it\\r\\nlearneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer\\r\\nto thrust one\\'s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it\\r\\nfreely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nA new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed\\r\\nblindly, and to approve of it--and no longer to slink aside from it,\\r\\nlike the sick and perishing!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sick and perishing--it was they who despised the body and the earth,\\r\\nand invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even\\r\\nthose sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for\\r\\nthem. Then they sighed: \"O that there were heavenly paths by which to\\r\\nsteal into another existence and into happiness!\" Then they contrived\\r\\nfor themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied\\r\\nthemselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe\\r\\nthe convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant\\r\\nat their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become\\r\\nconvalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly\\r\\non his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God;\\r\\nbut sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and\\r\\nlanguish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the\\r\\nlatest of virtues, which is uprightness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBackward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion\\r\\nand faith something different. Raving of the reason was likeness to God,\\r\\nand doubt was sin.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo well do I know those godlike ones: they insist on being believed in,\\r\\nand that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know what they themselves\\r\\nmost believe in.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but in the body\\r\\ndo they also believe most; and their own body is for them the\\r\\nthing-in-itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get out of their\\r\\nskin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of death, and themselves\\r\\npreach backworlds.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearken rather, my brethren, to the voice of the healthy body; it is a\\r\\nmore upright and pure voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore uprightly and purely speaketh the healthy body, perfect and\\r\\nsquare-built; and it speaketh of the meaning of the earth.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. THE DESPISERS OF THE BODY.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the despisers of the body will I speak my word. I wish them neither\\r\\nto learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own\\r\\nbodies,--and thus be dumb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Body am I, and soul\"--so saith the child. And why should one not speak\\r\\nlike children?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the awakened one, the knowing one, saith: \"Body am I entirely, and\\r\\nnothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body is a big sagacity, a plurality with one sense, a war and a\\r\\npeace, a flock and a shepherd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother, which\\r\\nthou callest \"spirit\"--a little instrument and plaything of thy big\\r\\nsagacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ego,\" sayest thou, and art proud of that word. But the greater\\r\\nthing--in which thou art unwilling to believe--is thy body with its big\\r\\nsagacity; it saith not \"ego,\" but doeth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the sense feeleth, what the spirit discerneth, hath never its end\\r\\nin itself. But sense and spirit would fain persuade thee that they are\\r\\nthe end of all things: so vain are they.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstruments and playthings are sense and spirit: behind them there\\r\\nis still the Self. The Self seeketh with the eyes of the senses, it\\r\\nhearkeneth also with the ears of the spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEver hearkeneth the Self, and seeketh; it compareth, mastereth,\\r\\nconquereth, and destroyeth. It ruleth, and is also the ego\\'s ruler.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind thy thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord,\\r\\nan unknown sage--it is called Self; it dwelleth in thy body, it is thy\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wisdom. And who then\\r\\nknoweth why thy body requireth just thy best wisdom?\\r\\n\\r\\nThy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. \"What are these\\r\\nprancings and flights of thought unto me?\" it saith to itself. \"A by-way\\r\\nto my purpose. I am the leading-string of the ego, and the prompter of\\r\\nits notions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Self saith unto the ego: \"Feel pain!\" And thereupon it suffereth,\\r\\nand thinketh how it may put an end thereto--and for that very purpose it\\r\\nIS MEANT to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Self saith unto the ego: \"Feel pleasure!\" Thereupon it rejoiceth,\\r\\nand thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice--and for that very purpose it\\r\\nIS MEANT to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they despise is\\r\\ncaused by their esteem. What is it that created esteeming and despising\\r\\nand worth and will?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, it created\\r\\nfor itself joy and woe. The creating body created for itself spirit, as\\r\\na hand to its will.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, ye despisers\\r\\nof the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth to die, and turneth away\\r\\nfrom life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:--create beyond\\r\\nitself. That is what it desireth most; that is all its fervour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is now too late to do so:--so your Self wisheth to succumb, ye\\r\\ndespisers of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo succumb--so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye become despisers\\r\\nof the body. For ye can no longer create beyond yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. And\\r\\nunconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no bridges for me to\\r\\nthe Superman!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV. JOYS AND PASSIONS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own virtue, thou\\r\\nhast it in common with no one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou wouldst\\r\\npull its ears and amuse thyself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the people, and hast\\r\\nbecome one of the people and the herd with thy virtue!\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter for thee to say: \"Ineffable is it, and nameless, that which is\\r\\npain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of my bowels.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou\\r\\nmust speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speak and stammer: \"That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it\\r\\nplease me entirely, thus only do _I_ desire the good.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human\\r\\nneed do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths\\r\\nand paradises.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and\\r\\nthe least everyday wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish\\r\\nit--now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But now hast thou only\\r\\nthy virtues: they grew out of thy passions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those passions: then\\r\\nbecame they thy virtues and joys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though thou wert of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the\\r\\nvoluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;\\r\\n\\r\\nAll thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils angels.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed at last into\\r\\nbirds and charming songstresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy cow,\\r\\naffliction, milkedst thou--now drinketh thou the sweet milk of her\\r\\nudder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be the evil that\\r\\ngroweth out of the conflict of thy virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one virtue and no\\r\\nmore: thus goest thou easier over the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIllustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one\\r\\nhath gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary\\r\\nof being the battle and battlefield of virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is the evil;\\r\\nnecessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the\\r\\nvirtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; it wanteth\\r\\nthy whole spirit to be ITS herald, it wanteth thy whole power, in wrath,\\r\\nhatred, and love.\\r\\n\\r\\nJealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is jealousy.\\r\\nEven virtues may succumb by jealousy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at last, like the\\r\\nscorpion, the poisoned sting against himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is something that hath to be surpassed: and therefore shalt thou\\r\\nlove thy virtues,--for thou wilt succumb by them.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. THE PALE CRIMINAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe do not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the animal hath\\r\\nbowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed his head: out of his\\r\\neye speaketh the great contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego is to me the\\r\\ngreat contempt of man\": so speaketh it out of that eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he judged himself--that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted\\r\\none relapse again into his low estate!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from himself, unless it\\r\\nbe speedy death.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and in that ye\\r\\nslay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom ye slay. Let\\r\\nyour sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye justify your own\\r\\nsurvival!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Enemy\" shall ye say but not \"villain,\" \"invalid\" shall ye say but not\\r\\n\"wretch,\" \"fool\" shall ye say but not \"sinner.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast done in\\r\\nthought, then would every one cry: \"Away with the nastiness and the\\r\\nvirulent reptile!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, and another\\r\\nthing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality doth not roll\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his deed when he\\r\\ndid it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call\\r\\nthis: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck bewitched\\r\\nhis weak reason. Madness AFTER the deed, I call this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and it is BEFORE\\r\\nthe deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into this soul!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speaketh the red judge: \"Why did this criminal commit murder? He\\r\\nmeant to rob.\" I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not\\r\\nbooty: he thirsted for the happiness of the knife!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his weak reason understood not this madness, and it persuaded him.\\r\\n\"What matter about blood!\" it said; \"wishest thou not, at least, to make\\r\\nbooty thereby? Or take revenge?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its words upon\\r\\nhim--thereupon he robbed when he murdered. He did not mean to be\\r\\nashamed of his madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, and once more is\\r\\nhis weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, and so dull.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; but who\\r\\nshaketh that head?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world\\r\\nthrough the spirit; there they want to get their prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom at peace among\\r\\nthemselves--so they go forth apart and seek prey in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul\\r\\ninterpreted to itself--it interpreted it as murderous desire, and\\r\\neagerness for the happiness of the knife.\\r\\n\\r\\nHim who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is now the evil: he\\r\\nseeketh to cause pain with that which causeth him pain. But there have\\r\\nbeen other ages, and another evil and good.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid became a\\r\\nheretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, and sought to\\r\\ncause suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good people, ye tell\\r\\nme. But what doth it matter to me about your good people!\\r\\n\\r\\nMany things in your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their\\r\\nevil. I would that they had a madness by which they succumbed, like this\\r\\npale criminal!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I would that their madness were called truth, or fidelity,\\r\\nor justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in\\r\\nwretched self-complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may\\r\\ngrasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVII. READING AND WRITING.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all that is written, I love only what a person hath written with his\\r\\nblood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood is spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the reading\\r\\nidlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the reader. Another\\r\\ncentury of readers--and spirit itself will stink.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long run not\\r\\nonly writing but also thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becometh\\r\\npopulace.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be read, but\\r\\nlearnt by heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that\\r\\nroute thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those\\r\\nspoken to should be big and tall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a\\r\\njoyful wickedness: thus are things well matched.\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The courage which\\r\\nscareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins--it wanteth to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see\\r\\nbeneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh--that is your\\r\\nthunder-cloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look downward because I\\r\\nam exalted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays\\r\\nand tragic realities.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive--so wisdom wisheth us; she\\r\\nis a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe tell me, \"Life is hard to bear.\" But for what purpose should ye have\\r\\nyour pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?\\r\\n\\r\\nLife is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We are all of\\r\\nus fine sumpter asses and assesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat have we in common with the rose-bud, which trembleth because a drop\\r\\nof dew hath formed upon it?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we\\r\\nare wont to love.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some\\r\\nmethod in madness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles,\\r\\nand whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit\\r\\nabout--that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound,\\r\\nsolemn: he was the spirit of gravity--through him all things fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the spirit\\r\\nof gravity!\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to fly;\\r\\nsince then I do not need pushing in order to move from a spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow am I light, now do I fly; now do I see myself under myself. Now\\r\\nthere danceth a God in me.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII. THE TREE ON THE HILL.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as\\r\\nhe walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called\\r\\n\"The Pied Cow,\" behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against\\r\\na tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra\\r\\nthereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to\\r\\ndo so.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth.\\r\\nWe are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: \"I hear Zarathustra,\\r\\nand just now was I thinking of him!\" Zarathustra answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why art thou frightened on that account?--But it is the same with man\\r\\nas with the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more\\r\\nvigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and\\r\\ndeep--into the evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yea, into the evil!\" cried the youth. \"How is it possible that thou\\r\\nhast discovered my soul?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra smiled, and said: \"Many a soul one will never discover,\\r\\nunless one first invent it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yea, into the evil!\" cried the youth once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I\\r\\nsought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how\\r\\ndoth that happen?\\r\\n\\r\\nI change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap\\r\\nthe steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the\\r\\nfrost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the\\r\\nmore do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my\\r\\nviolent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the\\r\\nheight!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside\\r\\nwhich they stood, and spake thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high\\r\\nabove man and beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it:\\r\\nso high hath it grown.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it waiteth and waiteth,--for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too\\r\\nclose to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first\\r\\nlightning?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent\\r\\ngestures: \"Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. My destruction\\r\\nI longed for, when I desired to be on the height, and thou art the\\r\\nlightning for which I waited! Lo! what have I been since thou hast\\r\\nappeared amongst us? It is mine envy of thee that hath destroyed\\r\\nme!\"--Thus spake the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put\\r\\nhis arm about him, and led the youth away with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine eyes tell\\r\\nme all thy danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet thou art not free; thou still SEEKEST freedom. Too unslept hath\\r\\nthy seeking made thee, and too wakeful.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth thy soul.\\r\\nBut thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThy wild dogs want liberty; they bark for joy in their cellar when thy\\r\\nspirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill art thou a prisoner--it seemeth to me--who deviseth liberty\\r\\nfor himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such prisoners, but also\\r\\ndeceitful and wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of the spirit.\\r\\nMuch of the prison and the mould still remaineth in him: pure hath his\\r\\neye still to become.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not\\r\\nthy love and hope away!\\r\\n\\r\\nNoble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel thee still,\\r\\nthough they bear thee a grudge and cast evil looks. Know this, that to\\r\\neverybody a noble one standeth in the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso to the good, a noble one standeth in the way: and even when they\\r\\ncall him a good man, they want thereby to put him aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new, would the noble man create, and a new virtue. The old, wanteth\\r\\nthe good man, and that the old should be conserved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not the danger of the noble man to turn a good man, but lest\\r\\nhe should become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they\\r\\ndisparaged all high hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen lived they shamelessly in temporary pleasures, and beyond the day\\r\\nhad hardly an aim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Spirit is also voluptuousness,\"--said they. Then broke the wings of\\r\\ntheir spirit; and now it creepeth about, and defileth where it gnaweth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce they thought of becoming heroes; but sensualists are they now. A\\r\\ntrouble and a terror is the hero to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by my love and hope I conjure thee: cast not away the hero in thy\\r\\nsoul! Maintain holy thy highest hope!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIX. THE PREACHERS OF DEATH.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom\\r\\ndesistance from life must be preached.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull is the earth of the superfluous; marred is life by the\\r\\nmany-too-many. May they be decoyed out of this life by the \"life\\r\\neternal\"!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The yellow ones\": so are called the preachers of death, or \"the black\\r\\nones.\" But I will show them unto you in other colours besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of\\r\\nprey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their\\r\\nlusts are self-laceration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach\\r\\ndesistance from life, and pass away themselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when\\r\\nthey begin to die, and long for doctrines of lassitude and renunciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey would fain be dead, and we should approve of their wish! Let\\r\\nus beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living\\r\\ncoffins!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse--and immediately they\\r\\nsay: \"Life is refuted!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they only are refuted, and their eye, which seeth only one aspect of\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that\\r\\nbring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr else, they grasp at sweetmeats, and mock at their childishness\\r\\nthereby: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their still\\r\\nclinging to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir wisdom speaketh thus: \"A fool, he who remaineth alive; but so far\\r\\nare we fools! And that is the foolishest thing in life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Life is only suffering\": so say others, and lie not. Then see to it\\r\\nthat YE cease! See to it that the life ceaseth which is only suffering!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let this be the teaching of your virtue: \"Thou shalt slay thyself!\\r\\nThou shalt steal away from thyself!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lust is sin,\"--so say some who preach death--\"let us go apart and beget\\r\\nno children!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Giving birth is troublesome,\"--say others--\"why still give birth? One\\r\\nbeareth only the unfortunate!\" And they also are preachers of death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pity is necessary,\"--so saith a third party. \"Take what I have! Take\\r\\nwhat I am! So much less doth life bind me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWere they consistently pitiful, then would they make their neighbours\\r\\nsick of life. To be wicked--that would be their true goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they want to be rid of life; what care they if they bind others\\r\\nstill faster with their chains and gifts!--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ye also, to whom life is rough labour and disquiet, are ye not very\\r\\ntired of life? Are ye not very ripe for the sermon of death?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll ye to whom rough labour is dear, and the rapid, new, and strange--ye\\r\\nput up with yourselves badly; your diligence is flight, and the will to\\r\\nself-forgetfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf ye believed more in life, then would ye devote yourselves less to the\\r\\nmomentary. But for waiting, ye have not enough of capacity in you--nor\\r\\neven for idling!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverywhere resoundeth the voices of those who preach death; and the\\r\\nearth is full of those to whom death hath to be preached.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr \"life eternal\"; it is all the same to me--if only they pass away\\r\\nquickly!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nX. WAR AND WARRIORS.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy our best enemies we do not want to be spared, nor by those either\\r\\nwhom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brethren in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was ever,\\r\\nyour counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the\\r\\ntruth!\\r\\n\\r\\nI know the hatred and envy of your hearts. Ye are not great enough not\\r\\nto know of hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of\\r\\nthem!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if ye cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least\\r\\nits warriors. They are the companions and forerunners of such saintship.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see many soldiers; could I but see many warriors! \"Uniform\" one\\r\\ncalleth what they wear; may it not be uniform what they therewith hide!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe shall be those whose eyes ever seek for an enemy--for YOUR enemy. And\\r\\nwith some of you there is hatred at first sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour enemy shall ye seek; your war shall ye wage, and for the sake of\\r\\nyour thoughts! And if your thoughts succumb, your uprightness shall\\r\\nstill shout triumph thereby!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe shall love peace as a means to new wars--and the short peace more\\r\\nthan the long.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou I advise not to work, but to fight. You I advise not to peace, but\\r\\nto victory. Let your work be a fight, let your peace be a victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can only be silent and sit peacefully when one hath arrow and bow;\\r\\notherwise one prateth and quarrelleth. Let your peace be a victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe say it is the good cause which halloweth even war? I say unto you: it\\r\\nis the good war which halloweth every cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nWar and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your\\r\\nsympathy, but your bravery hath hitherto saved the victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What is good?\" ye ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say:\\r\\n\"To be good is what is pretty, and at the same time touching.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love the\\r\\nbashfulness of your goodwill. Ye are ashamed of your flow, and others\\r\\nare ashamed of their ebb.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe are ugly? Well then, my brethren, take the sublime about you, the\\r\\nmantle of the ugly!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when your soul becometh great, then doth it become haughty, and in\\r\\nyour sublimity there is wickedness. I know you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn wickedness the haughty man and the weakling meet. But they\\r\\nmisunderstand one another. I know you.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe shall only have enemies to be hated, but not enemies to be despised.\\r\\nYe must be proud of your enemies; then, the successes of your enemies\\r\\nare also your successes.\\r\\n\\r\\nResistance--that is the distinction of the slave. Let your distinction\\r\\nbe obedience. Let your commanding itself be obeying!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the good warrior soundeth \"thou shalt\" pleasanter than \"I will.\" And\\r\\nall that is dear unto you, ye shall first have it commanded unto you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet your love to life be love to your highest hope; and let your highest\\r\\nhope be the highest thought of life!\\r\\n\\r\\nYour highest thought, however, ye shall have it commanded unto you by\\r\\nme--and it is this: man is something that is to be surpassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo live your life of obedience and of war! What matter about long life!\\r\\nWhat warrior wisheth to be spared!\\r\\n\\r\\nI spare you not, I love you from my very heart, my brethren in war!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXI. THE NEW IDOL.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my\\r\\nbrethren: here there are states.\\r\\n\\r\\nA state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, for now will I\\r\\nsay unto you my word concerning the death of peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nA state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth\\r\\nit also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: \"I, the state, am the\\r\\npeople.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung a faith\\r\\nand a love over them: thus they served life.\\r\\n\\r\\nDestroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the state:\\r\\nthey hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere there is still a people, there the state is not understood, but\\r\\nhated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its language of good\\r\\nand evil: this its neighbour understandeth not. Its language hath it\\r\\ndevised for itself in laws and customs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and whatever it\\r\\nsaith it lieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse is everything in it; with stolen teeth it biteth, the biting one.\\r\\nFalse are even its bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nConfusion of language of good and evil; this sign I give unto you as\\r\\nthe sign of the state. Verily, the will to death, indicateth this sign!\\r\\nVerily, it beckoneth unto the preachers of death!\\r\\n\\r\\nMany too many are born: for the superfluous ones was the state devised!\\r\\n\\r\\nSee just how it enticeth them to it, the many-too-many! How it\\r\\nswalloweth and cheweth and recheweth them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"On earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulating\\r\\nfinger of God\"--thus roareth the monster. And not only the long-eared\\r\\nand short-sighted fall upon their knees!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! even in your ears, ye great souls, it whispereth its gloomy lies!\\r\\nAh! it findeth out the rich hearts which willingly lavish themselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, it findeth you out too, ye conquerors of the old God! Weary ye\\r\\nbecame of the conflict, and now your weariness serveth the new idol!\\r\\n\\r\\nHeroes and honourable ones, it would fain set up around it, the new\\r\\nidol! Gladly it basketh in the sunshine of good consciences,--the cold\\r\\nmonster!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything will it give YOU, if YE worship it, the new idol: thus it\\r\\npurchaseth the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your proud eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seeketh to allure by means of you, the many-too-many! Yea, a hellish\\r\\nartifice hath here been devised, a death-horse jingling with the\\r\\ntrappings of divine honours!\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, a dying for many hath here been devised, which glorifieth itself as\\r\\nlife: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers of death!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the\\r\\nbad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the\\r\\nstate, where the slow suicide of all--is called \"life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust see these superfluous ones! They steal the works of the inventors\\r\\nand the treasures of the wise. Culture, they call their theft--and\\r\\neverything becometh sickness and trouble unto them!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust see these superfluous ones! Sick are they always; they vomit their\\r\\nbile and call it a newspaper. They devour one another, and cannot even\\r\\ndigest themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust see these superfluous ones! Wealth they acquire and become poorer\\r\\nthereby. Power they seek for, and above all, the lever of power, much\\r\\nmoney--these impotent ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nSee them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and\\r\\nthus scuffle into the mud and the abyss.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the throne they all strive: it is their madness--as if happiness\\r\\nsat on the throne! Ofttimes sitteth filth on the throne.--and ofttimes\\r\\nalso the throne on filth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Badly\\r\\nsmelleth their idol to me, the cold monster: badly they all smell to me,\\r\\nthese idolaters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brethren, will ye suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites!\\r\\nBetter break the windows and jump into the open air!\\r\\n\\r\\nDo go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the idolatry of the\\r\\nsuperfluous!\\r\\n\\r\\nDo go out of the way of the bad odour! Withdraw from the steam of these\\r\\nhuman sacrifices!\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen still remaineth the earth for great souls. Empty are still many\\r\\nsites for lone ones and twain ones, around which floateth the odour of\\r\\ntranquil seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen still remaineth a free life for great souls. Verily, he who\\r\\npossesseth little is so much the less possessed: blessed be moderate\\r\\npoverty!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, where the state ceaseth--there only commenceth the man who is not\\r\\nsuperfluous: there commenceth the song of the necessary ones, the single\\r\\nand irreplaceable melody.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, where the state CEASETH--pray look thither, my brethren! Do ye\\r\\nnot see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXII. THE FLIES IN THE MARKET-PLACE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlee, my friend, into thy solitude! I see thee deafened with the noise\\r\\nof the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmirably do forest and rock know how to be silent with thee. Resemble\\r\\nagain the tree which thou lovest, the broad-branched one--silently and\\r\\nattentively it o\\'erhangeth the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere solitude endeth, there beginneth the market-place; and where the\\r\\nmarket-place beginneth, there beginneth also the noise of the great\\r\\nactors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the world even the best things are worthless without those who\\r\\nrepresent them: those representers, the people call great men.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle do the people understand what is great--that is to say, the\\r\\ncreating agency. But they have a taste for all representers and actors\\r\\nof great things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the devisers of new values revolveth the world:--invisibly it\\r\\nrevolveth. But around the actors revolve the people and the glory: such\\r\\nis the course of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpirit, hath the actor, but little conscience of the spirit. He\\r\\nbelieveth always in that wherewith he maketh believe most strongly--in\\r\\nHIMSELF!\\r\\n\\r\\nTomorrow he hath a new belief, and the day after, one still newer. Sharp\\r\\nperceptions hath he, like the people, and changeable humours.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo upset--that meaneth with him to prove. To drive mad--that meaneth\\r\\nwith him to convince. And blood is counted by him as the best of all\\r\\narguments.\\r\\n\\r\\nA truth which only glideth into fine ears, he calleth falsehood and\\r\\ntrumpery. Verily, he believeth only in Gods that make a great noise in\\r\\nthe world!\\r\\n\\r\\nFull of clattering buffoons is the market-place,--and the people glory\\r\\nin their great men! These are for them the masters of the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the hour presseth them; so they press thee. And also from thee\\r\\nthey want Yea or Nay. Alas! thou wouldst set thy chair betwixt For and\\r\\nAgainst?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn account of those absolute and impatient ones, be not jealous, thou\\r\\nlover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of an absolute one.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn account of those abrupt ones, return into thy security: only in the\\r\\nmarket-place is one assailed by Yea? or Nay?\\r\\n\\r\\nSlow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait\\r\\nuntil they know WHAT hath fallen into their depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from the market-place and from fame taketh place all that is great:\\r\\naway from the market-Place and from fame have ever dwelt the devisers of\\r\\nnew values.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlee, my friend, into thy solitude: I see thee stung all over by the\\r\\npoisonous flies. Flee thither, where a rough, strong breeze bloweth!\\r\\n\\r\\nFlee into thy solitude! Thou hast lived too closely to the small and the\\r\\npitiable. Flee from their invisible vengeance! Towards thee they have\\r\\nnothing but vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaise no longer an arm against them! Innumerable are they, and it is not\\r\\nthy lot to be a fly-flap.\\r\\n\\r\\nInnumerable are the small and pitiable ones; and of many a proud\\r\\nstructure, rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art not stone; but already hast thou become hollow by the numerous\\r\\ndrops. Thou wilt yet break and burst by the numerous drops.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhausted I see thee, by poisonous flies; bleeding I see thee, and torn\\r\\nat a hundred spots; and thy pride will not even upbraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood they would have from thee in all innocence; blood their bloodless\\r\\nsouls crave for--and they sting, therefore, in all innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou, profound one, thou sufferest too profoundly even from small\\r\\nwounds; and ere thou hadst recovered, the same poison-worm crawled over\\r\\nthy hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo proud art thou to kill these sweet-tooths. But take care lest it be\\r\\nthy fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey buzz around thee also with their praise: obtrusiveness, is their\\r\\npraise. They want to be close to thy skin and thy blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey flatter thee, as one flattereth a God or devil; they whimper before\\r\\nthee, as before a God or devil. What doth it come to! Flatterers are\\r\\nthey, and whimperers, and nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, also, do they show themselves to thee as amiable ones. But that\\r\\nhath ever been the prudence of the cowardly. Yea! the cowardly are wise!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey think much about thee with their circumscribed souls--thou art\\r\\nalways suspected by them! Whatever is much thought about is at last\\r\\nthought suspicious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey punish thee for all thy virtues. They pardon thee in their inmost\\r\\nhearts only--for thine errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause thou art gentle and of upright character, thou sayest:\\r\\n\"Blameless are they for their small existence.\" But their circumscribed\\r\\nsouls think: \"Blamable is all great existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven when thou art gentle towards them, they still feel themselves\\r\\ndespised by thee; and they repay thy beneficence with secret\\r\\nmaleficence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThy silent pride is always counter to their taste; they rejoice if once\\r\\nthou be humble enough to be frivolous.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we recognise in a man, we also irritate in him. Therefore be on\\r\\nyour guard against the small ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thy presence they feel themselves small, and their baseness gleameth\\r\\nand gloweth against thee in invisible vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSawest thou not how often they became dumb when thou approachedst them,\\r\\nand how their energy left them like the smoke of an extinguishing fire?\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, my friend, the bad conscience art thou of thy neighbours; for they\\r\\nare unworthy of thee. Therefore they hate thee, and would fain suck thy\\r\\nblood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThy neighbours will always be poisonous flies; what is great in\\r\\nthee--that itself must make them more poisonous, and always more\\r\\nfly-like.\\r\\n\\r\\nFlee, my friend, into thy solitude--and thither, where a rough strong\\r\\nbreeze bloweth. It is not thy lot to be a fly-flap.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIII. CHASTITY.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too\\r\\nmany of the lustful.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer, than into the\\r\\ndreams of a lustful woman?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just look at these men: their eye saith it--they know nothing better\\r\\non earth than to lie with a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth hath\\r\\nstill spirit in it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWould that ye were perfect--at least as animals! But to animals\\r\\nbelongeth innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I counsel you to slay your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in\\r\\nyour instincts.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but with\\r\\nmany almost a vice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are continent, to be sure: but doggish lust looketh enviously out\\r\\nof all that they do.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit doth\\r\\nthis creature follow them, with its discord.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how nicely can doggish lust beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece\\r\\nof flesh is denied it!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe love tragedies and all that breaketh the heart? But I am distrustful\\r\\nof your doggish lust.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe have too cruel eyes, and ye look wantonly towards the sufferers.\\r\\nHath not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of\\r\\nfellow-suffering?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd also this parable give I unto you: Not a few who meant to cast out\\r\\ntheir devil, went thereby into the swine themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the\\r\\nroad to hell--to filth and lust of soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, doth the\\r\\ndiscerning one go unwillingly into its waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, there are chaste ones from their very nature; they are gentler\\r\\nof heart, and laugh better and oftener than you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey laugh also at chastity, and ask: \"What is chastity?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs chastity not folly? But the folly came unto us, and not we unto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe offered that guest harbour and heart: now it dwelleth with us--let it\\r\\nstay as long as it will!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIV. THE FRIEND.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"One, is always too many about me\"--thinketh the anchorite. \"Always once\\r\\none--that maketh two in the long run!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI and me are always too earnestly in conversation: how could it be\\r\\nendured, if there were not a friend?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe friend of the anchorite is always the third one: the third one is\\r\\nthe cork which preventeth the conversation of the two sinking into the\\r\\ndepth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! there are too many depths for all anchorites. Therefore, do they\\r\\nlong so much for a friend, and for his elevation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur faith in others betrayeth wherein we would fain have faith in\\r\\nourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd often with our love we want merely to overleap envy. And often we\\r\\nattack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be at least mine enemy!\"--thus speaketh the true reverence, which doth\\r\\nnot venture to solicit friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one would have a friend, then must one also be willing to wage war\\r\\nfor him: and in order to wage war, one must be CAPABLE of being an\\r\\nenemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne ought still to honour the enemy in one\\'s friend. Canst thou go nigh\\r\\nunto thy friend, and not go over to him?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one\\'s friend one shall have one\\'s best enemy. Thou shalt be closest\\r\\nunto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in honour of thy\\r\\nfriend that thou showest thyself to him as thou art? But he wisheth thee\\r\\nto the devil on that account!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who maketh no secret of himself shocketh: so much reason have ye\\r\\nto fear nakedness! Aye, if ye were Gods, ye could then be ashamed of\\r\\nclothing!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou canst not adorn thyself fine enough for thy friend; for thou shalt\\r\\nbe unto him an arrow and a longing for the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nSawest thou ever thy friend asleep--to know how he looketh? What is\\r\\nusually the countenance of thy friend? It is thine own countenance, in a\\r\\ncoarse and imperfect mirror.\\r\\n\\r\\nSawest thou ever thy friend asleep? Wert thou not dismayed at thy friend\\r\\nlooking so? O my friend, man is something that hath to be surpassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: not\\r\\neverything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall disclose unto thee\\r\\nwhat thy friend doeth when awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet thy pity be a divining: to know first if thy friend wanteth pity.\\r\\nPerhaps he loveth in thee the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet thy pity for thy friend be hid under a hard shell; thou shalt bite\\r\\nout a tooth upon it. Thus will it have delicacy and sweetness.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to thy friend?\\r\\nMany a one cannot loosen his own fetters, but is nevertheless his\\r\\nfriend\\'s emancipator.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou a slave? Then thou canst not be a friend. Art thou a tyrant?\\r\\nThen thou canst not have friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar too long hath there been a slave and a tyrant concealed in woman.\\r\\nOn that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knoweth only\\r\\nlove.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn woman\\'s love there is injustice and blindness to all she doth not\\r\\nlove. And even in woman\\'s conscious love, there is still always surprise\\r\\nand lightning and night, along with the light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats, and\\r\\nbirds. Or at the best, cows.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, ye men, who of\\r\\nyou are capable of friendship?\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! your poverty, ye men, and your sordidness of soul! As much as ye\\r\\ngive to your friend, will I give even to my foe, and will not have\\r\\nbecome poorer thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is comradeship: may there be friendship!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXV. THE THOUSAND AND ONE GOALS.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: thus he discovered the\\r\\ngood and bad of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on\\r\\nearth than good and bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo people could live without first valuing; if a people will maintain\\r\\nitself, however, it must not value as its neighbour valueth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and\\r\\ncontempt by another: thus I found it. Much found I here called bad,\\r\\nwhich was there decked with purple honours.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did the one neighbour understand the other: ever did his soul\\r\\nmarvel at his neighbour\\'s delusion and wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nA table of excellencies hangeth over every people. Lo! it is the table\\r\\nof their triumphs; lo! it is the voice of their Will to Power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is laudable, what they think hard; what is indispensable and hard\\r\\nthey call good; and what relieveth in the direst distress, the unique\\r\\nand hardest of all,--they extol as holy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever maketh them rule and conquer and shine, to the dismay and envy\\r\\nof their neighbours, they regard as the high and foremost thing, the\\r\\ntest and the meaning of all else.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, my brother, if thou knewest but a people\\'s need, its land,\\r\\nits sky, and its neighbour, then wouldst thou divine the law of its\\r\\nsurmountings, and why it climbeth up that ladder to its hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Always shalt thou be the foremost and prominent above others: no one\\r\\nshall thy jealous soul love, except a friend\"--that made the soul of a\\r\\nGreek thrill: thereby went he his way to greatness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow\"--so seemed it alike\\r\\npleasing and hard to the people from whom cometh my name--the name which\\r\\nis alike pleasing and hard to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To honour father and mother, and from the root of the soul to do their\\r\\nwill\"--this table of surmounting hung another people over them, and\\r\\nbecame powerful and permanent thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To have fidelity, and for the sake of fidelity to risk honour and\\r\\nblood, even in evil and dangerous courses\"--teaching itself so, another\\r\\npeople mastered itself, and thus mastering itself, became pregnant and\\r\\nheavy with great hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, men have given unto themselves all their good and bad. Verily,\\r\\nthey took it not, they found it not, it came not unto them as a voice\\r\\nfrom heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nValues did man only assign to things in order to maintain himself--he\\r\\ncreated only the significance of things, a human significance!\\r\\nTherefore, calleth he himself \"man,\" that is, the valuator.\\r\\n\\r\\nValuing is creating: hear it, ye creating ones! Valuation itself is the\\r\\ntreasure and jewel of the valued things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough valuation only is there value; and without valuation the nut of\\r\\nexistence would be hollow. Hear it, ye creating ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nChange of values--that is, change of the creating ones. Always doth he\\r\\ndestroy who hath to be a creator.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating ones were first of all peoples, and only in late times\\r\\nindividuals; verily, the individual himself is still the latest\\r\\ncreation.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeoples once hung over them tables of the good. Love which would rule\\r\\nand love which would obey, created for themselves such tables.\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the ego: and as\\r\\nlong as the good conscience is for the herd, the bad conscience only\\r\\nsaith: ego.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, the crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeketh its advantage in\\r\\nthe advantage of many--it is not the origin of the herd, but its ruin.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoving ones, was it always, and creating ones, that created good and\\r\\nbad. Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the virtues, and fire of\\r\\nwrath.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples: no greater power did\\r\\nZarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones--\"good\"\\r\\nand \"bad\" are they called.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming. Tell me, ye\\r\\nbrethren, who will master it for me? Who will put a fetter upon the\\r\\nthousand necks of this animal?\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand peoples have\\r\\nthere been. Only the fetter for the thousand necks is still lacking;\\r\\nthere is lacking the one goal. As yet humanity hath not a goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut pray tell me, my brethren, if the goal of humanity be still lacking,\\r\\nis there not also still lacking--humanity itself?--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVI. NEIGHBOUR-LOVE.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe crowd around your neighbour, and have fine words for it. But I say\\r\\nunto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe flee unto your neighbour from yourselves, and would fain make a\\r\\nvirtue thereof: but I fathom your \"unselfishness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe THOU is older than the _I_; the THOU hath been consecrated, but not\\r\\nyet the _I_: so man presseth nigh unto his neighbour.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo I advise you to neighbour-love? Rather do I advise you to\\r\\nneighbour-flight and to furthest love!\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher than love to your neighbour is love to the furthest and future\\r\\nones; higher still than love to men, is love to things and phantoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phantom that runneth on before thee, my brother, is fairer than\\r\\nthou; why dost thou not give unto it thy flesh and thy bones? But thou\\r\\nfearest, and runnest unto thy neighbour.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe cannot endure it with yourselves, and do not love yourselves\\r\\nsufficiently: so ye seek to mislead your neighbour into love, and would\\r\\nfain gild yourselves with his error.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould that ye could not endure it with any kind of near ones, or their\\r\\nneighbours; then would ye have to create your friend and his overflowing\\r\\nheart out of yourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe call in a witness when ye want to speak well of yourselves; and\\r\\nwhen ye have misled him to think well of you, ye also think well of\\r\\nyourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowledge, but more\\r\\nso, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. And thus speak ye\\r\\nof yourselves in your intercourse, and belie your neighbour with\\r\\nyourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus saith the fool: \"Association with men spoileth the character,\\r\\nespecially when one hath none.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh himself, and the other\\r\\nbecause he would fain lose himself. Your bad love to yourselves maketh\\r\\nsolitude a prison to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the near ones; and\\r\\nwhen there are but five of you together, a sixth must always die.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love not your festivals either: too many actors found I there, and\\r\\neven the spectators often behaved like actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the neighbour do I teach you, but the friend. Let the friend be the\\r\\nfestival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one must know how\\r\\nto be a sponge, if one would be loved by overflowing hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete, a capsule\\r\\nof the good,--the creating friend, who hath always a complete world to\\r\\nbestow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolleth it together again\\r\\nfor him in rings, as the growth of good through evil, as the growth of\\r\\npurpose out of chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet the future and the furthest be the motive of thy to-day; in thy\\r\\nfriend shalt thou love the Superman as thy motive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy brethren, I advise you not to neighbour-love--I advise you to\\r\\nfurthest love!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVII. THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWouldst thou go into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thou seek the way\\r\\nunto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation is wrong\": so\\r\\nsay the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou sayest,\\r\\n\"I have no longer a conscience in common with you,\" then will it be a\\r\\nplaint and a pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and the last gleam\\r\\nof that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the way unto\\r\\nthyself? Then show me thine authority and thy strength to do so!\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou a new strength and a new authority? A first motion? A\\r\\nself-rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars to revolve around thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so many\\r\\nconvulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not a lusting and\\r\\nambitious one!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the\\r\\nbellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and\\r\\nnot that thou hast escaped from a yoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away\\r\\nhis final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly, however,\\r\\nshall thine eye show unto me: free FOR WHAT?\\r\\n\\r\\nCanst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set up thy will\\r\\nas a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, and avenger of thy\\r\\nlaw?\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one\\'s own law.\\r\\nThus is a star projected into desert space, and into the icy breath of\\r\\naloneness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individual; to-day\\r\\nhast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy pride yield,\\r\\nand thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: \"I am alone!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too closely thy\\r\\nlowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom. Thou\\r\\nwilt one day cry: \"All is false!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if they do not\\r\\nsucceed, then must they themselves die! But art thou capable of it--to\\r\\nbe a murderer?\\r\\n\\r\\nHast thou ever known, my brother, the word \"disdain\"? And the anguish of\\r\\nthy justice in being just to those that disdain thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nThou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, charge they\\r\\nheavily to thine account. Thou camest nigh unto them, and yet wentest\\r\\npast: for that they never forgive thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the smaller doth the\\r\\neye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is the flying one hated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How could ye be just unto me!\"--must thou say--\"I choose your injustice\\r\\nas my allotted portion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nInjustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one: but, my brother, if\\r\\nthou wouldst be a star, thou must shine for them none the less on that\\r\\naccount!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd be on thy guard against the good and just! They would fain crucify\\r\\nthose who devise their own virtue--they hate the lonesome ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy to it that\\r\\nis not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the fire--of the fagot\\r\\nand stake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! Too readily\\r\\ndoth the recluse reach his hand to any one who meeteth him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy paw; and I\\r\\nwish thy paw also to have claws.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself always be; thou\\r\\nwaylayest thyself in caverns and forests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And past thyself and\\r\\nthy seven devils leadeth thy way!\\r\\n\\r\\nA heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth-sayer, and a\\r\\nfool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.\\r\\n\\r\\nReady must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how couldst thou\\r\\nbecome new if thou have not first become ashes!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one: a God wilt\\r\\nthou create for thyself out of thy seven devils!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: thou lovest\\r\\nthyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, as only the loving\\r\\nones despise.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! What knoweth\\r\\nhe of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with thy\\r\\ncreating; and late only will justice limp after thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love him who\\r\\nseeketh to create beyond himself, and thus succumbeth.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXVIII. OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And\\r\\nwhat hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that hath been\\r\\nborn thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief\\'s errand, thou friend of the\\r\\nevil?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that hath been\\r\\ngiven me: it is a little truth which I carry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its mouth, it\\r\\nscreameth too loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I went on my way alone to-day, at the hour when the sun declineth,\\r\\nthere met me an old woman, and she spake thus unto my soul:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Much hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spake he unto\\r\\nus concerning woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered her: \"Concerning woman, one should only talk unto men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Talk also unto me of woman,\" said she; \"I am old enough to forget it\\r\\npresently.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her:\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman hath one\\r\\nsolution--it is called pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what is\\r\\nwoman for man?\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo different things wanteth the true man: danger and diversion.\\r\\nTherefore wanteth he woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the\\r\\nwarrior: all else is folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo sweet fruits--these the warrior liketh not. Therefore liketh he\\r\\nwoman;--bitter is even the sweetest woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter than man doth woman understand children, but man is more childish\\r\\nthan woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. Up then, ye\\r\\nwomen, and discover the child in man!\\r\\n\\r\\nA plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious stone,\\r\\nillumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: \"May I\\r\\nbear the Superman!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye assail him who\\r\\ninspireth you with fear!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand otherwise\\r\\nabout honour. But let this be your honour: always to love more than ye\\r\\nare loved, and never be the second.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet man fear woman when she loveth: then maketh she every sacrifice, and\\r\\neverything else she regardeth as worthless.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet man fear woman when she hateth: for man in his innermost soul is\\r\\nmerely evil; woman, however, is mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom hateth woman most?--Thus spake the iron to the loadstone: \"I hate\\r\\nthee most, because thou attractest, but art too weak to draw unto thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe happiness of man is, \"I will.\" The happiness of woman is, \"He will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lo! now hath the world become perfect!\"--thus thinketh every woman when\\r\\nshe obeyeth with all her love.\\r\\n\\r\\nObey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. Surface, is\\r\\nwoman\\'s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow water.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan\\'s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subterranean\\r\\ncaverns: woman surmiseth its force, but comprehendeth it not.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThen answered me the old woman: \"Many fine things hath Zarathustra said,\\r\\nespecially for those who are young enough for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet he is right\\r\\nabout them! Doth this happen, because with women nothing is impossible?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old enough for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nSwaddle it up and hold its mouth: otherwise it will scream too loudly,\\r\\nthe little truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Give me, woman, thy little truth!\" said I. And thus spake the old\\r\\nwoman:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX. THE BITE OF THE ADDER.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the\\r\\nheat, with his arms over his face. And there came an adder and bit him\\r\\nin the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed with pain. When he had\\r\\ntaken his arm from his face he looked at the serpent; and then did it\\r\\nrecognise the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get\\r\\naway. \"Not at all,\" said Zarathustra, \"as yet hast thou not received\\r\\nmy thanks! Thou hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.\"\\r\\n\"Thy journey is short,\" said the adder sadly; \"my poison is fatal.\"\\r\\nZarathustra smiled. \"When did ever a dragon die of a serpent\\'s\\r\\npoison?\"--said he. \"But take thy poison back! Thou art not rich enough\\r\\nto present it to me.\" Then fell the adder again on his neck, and licked\\r\\nhis wound.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked him:\\r\\n\"And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?\" And Zarathustra\\r\\nanswered them thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my story is\\r\\nimmoral.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not good for evil: for\\r\\nthat would abash him. But prove that he hath done something good to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are cursed, it\\r\\npleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. Rather curse a\\r\\nlittle also!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five small ones\\r\\nbesides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice presseth alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And he who can\\r\\nbear it, shall take the injustice upon himself!\\r\\n\\r\\nA small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if the punishment\\r\\nbe not also a right and an honour to the transgressor, I do not like\\r\\nyour punishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish one\\'s right,\\r\\nespecially if one be in the right. Only, one must be rich enough to do\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges there\\r\\nalways glanceth the executioner and his cold steel.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me: where find we justice, which is love with seeing eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\nDevise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punishment, but\\r\\nalso all guilt!\\r\\n\\r\\nDevise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one except the\\r\\njudge!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be just from the\\r\\nheart, even the lie becometh philanthropy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every one his\\r\\nown! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one mine own.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any anchorite. How\\r\\ncould an anchorite forget! How could he requite!\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a deep well is an anchorite. Easy is it to throw in a stone: if\\r\\nit should sink to the bottom, however, tell me, who will bring it out\\r\\nagain?\\r\\n\\r\\nGuard against injuring the anchorite! If ye have done so, however, well\\r\\nthen, kill him also!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXX. CHILD AND MARRIAGE.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, cast\\r\\nI this question into thy soul, that I may know its depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I ask thee: Art\\r\\nthou a man ENTITLED to desire a child?\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of thy\\r\\npassions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or isolation? Or\\r\\ndiscord in thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nI would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. Living monuments\\r\\nshalt thou build to thy victory and emancipation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou be built\\r\\nthyself, rectangular in body and soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! For that\\r\\npurpose may the garden of marriage help thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nA higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spontaneously\\r\\nrolling wheel--a creating one shalt thou create.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that is\\r\\nmore than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those\\r\\nexercising such a will, call I marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. But that\\r\\nwhich the many-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones--ah, what\\r\\nshall I call it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in the\\r\\ntwain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain!\\r\\n\\r\\nMarriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are made in\\r\\nheaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not\\r\\nlike them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils!\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless what he hath\\r\\nnot matched!\\r\\n\\r\\nLaugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason to weep over\\r\\nits parents?\\r\\n\\r\\nWorthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but\\r\\nwhen I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me a home for madcaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, I would that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a\\r\\ngoose mate with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for\\r\\nhimself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. But one time he\\r\\nspoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calleth it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But all at once\\r\\nhe became the handmaid of a woman, and now would he need also to become\\r\\nan angel.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes. But\\r\\neven the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany short follies--that is called love by you. And your marriage\\r\\nputteth an end to many short follies, with one long stupidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour love to woman, and woman\\'s love to man--ah, would that it were\\r\\nsympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But generally two animals\\r\\nalight on one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a painful\\r\\nardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then LEARN first of all to\\r\\nlove. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter cup of your love.\\r\\n\\r\\nBitterness is in the cup even of the best love: thus doth it cause\\r\\nlonging for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in thee, the\\r\\ncreating one!\\r\\n\\r\\nThirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Superman: tell me,\\r\\nmy brother, is this thy will to marriage?\\r\\n\\r\\nHoly call I such a will, and such a marriage.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXI. VOLUNTARY DEATH.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange soundeth the\\r\\nprecept: \"Die at the right time!\\r\\n\\r\\nDie at the right time: so teacheth Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how could he ever die\\r\\nat the right time? Would that he might never be born!--Thus do I advise\\r\\nthe superfluous ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even the superfluous ones make much ado about their death, and even\\r\\nthe hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one regardeth dying as a great matter: but as yet death is not\\r\\na festival. Not yet have people learned to inaugurate the finest\\r\\nfestivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consummating death I show unto you, which becometh a stimulus and\\r\\npromise to the living.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis death, dieth the consummating one triumphantly, surrounded by hoping\\r\\nand promising ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival at which\\r\\nsuch a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the living!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, and\\r\\nsacrifice a great soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor, is your grinning\\r\\ndeath which stealeth nigh like a thief,--and yet cometh as master.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which cometh unto me\\r\\nbecause _I_ want it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when shall I want it?--He that hath a goal and an heir, wanteth\\r\\ndeath at the right time for the goal and the heir.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd out of reverence for the goal and the heir, he will hang up no more\\r\\nwithered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, not the rope-makers will I resemble: they lengthen out their\\r\\ncord, and thereby go ever backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a one, also, waxeth too old for his truths and triumphs; a\\r\\ntoothless mouth hath no longer the right to every truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whoever wanteth to have fame, must take leave of honour betimes, and\\r\\npractise the difficult art of--going at the right time.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must discontinue being feasted upon when one tasteth best: that is\\r\\nknown by those who want to be long loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nSour apples are there, no doubt, whose lot is to wait until the last\\r\\nday of autumn: and at the same time they become ripe, yellow, and\\r\\nshrivelled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some ageth the heart first, and in others the spirit. And some are\\r\\nhoary in youth, but the late young keep long young.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many men life is a failure; a poison-worm gnaweth at their heart.\\r\\nThen let them see to it that their dying is all the more a success.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany never become sweet; they rot even in the summer. It is cowardice\\r\\nthat holdeth them fast to their branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar too many live, and far too long hang they on their branches. Would\\r\\nthat a storm came and shook all this rottenness and worm-eatenness from\\r\\nthe tree!\\r\\n\\r\\nWould that there came preachers of SPEEDY death! Those would be the\\r\\nappropriate storms and agitators of the trees of life! But I hear only\\r\\nslow death preached, and patience with all that is \"earthly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! ye preach patience with what is earthly? This earthly is it that\\r\\nhath too much patience with you, ye blasphemers!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death\\r\\nhonour: and to many hath it proved a calamity that he died too early.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet had he known only tears, and the melancholy of the Hebrews,\\r\\ntogether with the hatred of the good and just--the Hebrew Jesus: then\\r\\nwas he seized with the longing for death.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the good and just!\\r\\nThen, perhaps, would he have learned to live, and love the earth--and\\r\\nlaughter also!\\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would have\\r\\ndisavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble enough was he to\\r\\ndisavow!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he was still immature. Immaturely loveth the youth, and immaturely\\r\\nalso hateth he man and earth. Confined and awkward are still his soul\\r\\nand the wings of his spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less of\\r\\nmelancholy: better understandeth he about life and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree for death, and free in death; a holy Naysayer, when there is no\\r\\nlonger time for Yea: thus understandeth he about death and life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat your dying may not be a reproach to man and the earth, my friends:\\r\\nthat do I solicit from the honey of your soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your dying shall your spirit and your virtue still shine like an\\r\\nevening after-glow around the earth: otherwise your dying hath been\\r\\nunsatisfactory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus will I die myself, that ye friends may love the earth more for my\\r\\nsake; and earth will I again become, to have rest in her that bore me.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a goal had Zarathustra; he threw his ball. Now be ye friends the\\r\\nheirs of my goal; to you throw I the golden ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest of all, do I see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! And so\\r\\ntarry I still a little while on the earth--pardon me for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXII. THE BESTOWING VIRTUE.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was\\r\\nattached, the name of which is \"The Pied Cow,\" there followed him many\\r\\npeople who called themselves his disciples, and kept him company. Thus\\r\\ncame they to a crossroad. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted\\r\\nto go alone; for he was fond of going alone. His disciples, however,\\r\\npresented him at his departure with a staff, on the golden handle of\\r\\nwhich a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account\\r\\nof the staff, and supported himself thereon; then spake he thus to his\\r\\ndisciples:\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me, pray: how came gold to the highest value? Because it is\\r\\nuncommon, and unprofiting, and beaming, and soft in lustre; it always\\r\\nbestoweth itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest value.\\r\\nGoldlike, beameth the glance of the bestower. Gold-lustre maketh peace\\r\\nbetween moon and sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncommon is the highest virtue, and unprofiting, beaming is it, and soft\\r\\nof lustre: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I divine you well, my disciples: ye strive like me for the\\r\\nbestowing virtue. What should ye have in common with cats and wolves?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and\\r\\ntherefore have ye the thirst to accumulate all riches in your soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nInsatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels, because your\\r\\nvirtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe constrain all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they\\r\\nshall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, an appropriator of all values must such bestowing love become;\\r\\nbut healthy and holy, call I this selfishness.--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother selfishness is there, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which\\r\\nwould always steal--the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous; with the\\r\\ncraving of hunger it measureth him who hath abundance; and ever doth it\\r\\nprowl round the tables of bestowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSickness speaketh in such craving, and invisible degeneration; of a\\r\\nsickly body, speaketh the larcenous craving of this selfishness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not\\r\\nDEGENERATION?--And we always suspect degeneration when the bestowing\\r\\nsoul is lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpward goeth our course from genera on to super-genera. But a horror to\\r\\nus is the degenerating sense, which saith: \"All for myself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpward soareth our sense: thus is it a simile of our body, a simile of\\r\\nan elevation. Such similes of elevations are the names of the virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus goeth the body through history, a becomer and fighter. And the\\r\\nspirit--what is it to the body? Its fights\\' and victories\\' herald, its\\r\\ncompanion and echo.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimiles, are all names of good and evil; they do not speak out, they\\r\\nonly hint. A fool who seeketh knowledge from them!\\r\\n\\r\\nGive heed, my brethren, to every hour when your spirit would speak in\\r\\nsimiles: there is the origin of your virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nElevated is then your body, and raised up; with its delight, enraptureth\\r\\nit the spirit; so that it becometh creator, and valuer, and lover, and\\r\\neverything\\'s benefactor.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, a blessing\\r\\nand a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin of your virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen ye are exalted above praise and blame, and your will would command\\r\\nall things, as a loving one\\'s will: there is the origin of your virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen ye despise pleasant things, and the effeminate couch, and cannot\\r\\ncouch far enough from the effeminate: there is the origin of your\\r\\nvirtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen ye are willers of one will, and when that change of every need is\\r\\nneedful to you: there is the origin of your virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a new good and evil is it! Verily, a new deep murmuring, and the\\r\\nvoice of a new fountain!\\r\\n\\r\\nPower is it, this new virtue; a ruling thought is it, and around it a\\r\\nsubtle soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere paused Zarathustra awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples.\\r\\nThen he continued to speak thus--and his voice had changed:\\r\\n\\r\\nRemain true to the earth, my brethren, with the power of your virtue!\\r\\nLet your bestowing love and your knowledge be devoted to be the meaning\\r\\nof the earth! Thus do I pray and conjure you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal walls with\\r\\nits wings! Ah, there hath always been so much flown-away virtue!\\r\\n\\r\\nLead, like me, the flown-away virtue back to the earth--yea, back\\r\\nto body and life: that it may give to the earth its meaning, a human\\r\\nmeaning!\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown away\\r\\nand blundered. Alas! in our body dwelleth still all this delusion and\\r\\nblundering: body and will hath it there become.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue attempted and\\r\\nerred. Yea, an attempt hath man been. Alas, much ignorance and error\\r\\nhath become embodied in us!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only the rationality of millenniums--also their madness, breaketh\\r\\nout in us. Dangerous is it to be an heir.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill fight we step by step with the giant Chance, and over all mankind\\r\\nhath hitherto ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet your spirit and your virtue be devoted to the sense of the earth,\\r\\nmy brethren: let the value of everything be determined anew by you!\\r\\nTherefore shall ye be fighters! Therefore shall ye be creators!\\r\\n\\r\\nIntelligently doth the body purify itself; attempting with intelligence\\r\\nit exalteth itself; to the discerners all impulses sanctify themselves;\\r\\nto the exalted the soul becometh joyful.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysician, heal thyself: then wilt thou also heal thy patient. Let it be\\r\\nhis best cure to see with his eyes him who maketh himself whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nA thousand paths are there which have never yet been trodden; a thousand\\r\\nsalubrities and hidden islands of life. Unexhausted and undiscovered is\\r\\nstill man and man\\'s world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwake and hearken, ye lonesome ones! From the future come winds with\\r\\nstealthy pinions, and to fine ears good tidings are proclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe lonesome ones of to-day, ye seceding ones, ye shall one day be a\\r\\npeople: out of you who have chosen yourselves, shall a chosen people\\r\\narise:--and out of it the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a place of healing shall the earth become! And already is a new\\r\\nodour diffused around it, a salvation-bringing odour--and a new hope!\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had not\\r\\nsaid his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in his\\r\\nhand. At last he spake thus--and his voice had changed:\\r\\n\\r\\nI now go alone, my disciples! Ye also now go away, and alone! So will I\\r\\nhave it.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against\\r\\nZarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he hath\\r\\ndeceived you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also\\r\\nto hate his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne requiteth a teacher badly if one remain merely a scholar. And why\\r\\nwill ye not pluck at my wreath?\\r\\n\\r\\nYe venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day collapse?\\r\\nTake heed lest a statue crush you!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe say, ye believe in Zarathustra? But of what account is Zarathustra!\\r\\nYe are my believers: but of what account are all believers!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe had not yet sought yourselves: then did ye find me. So do all\\r\\nbelievers; therefore all belief is of so little account.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow do I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when ye have all\\r\\ndenied me, will I return unto you.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones;\\r\\nwith another love shall I then love you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once again shall ye have become friends unto me, and children of one\\r\\nhope: then will I be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great\\r\\nnoontide with you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course\\r\\nbetween animal and Superman, and celebrateth his advance to the evening\\r\\nas his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt such time will the down-goer bless himself, that he should be an\\r\\nover-goer; and the sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"DEAD ARE ALL THE GODS: NOW DO WE DESIRE THE SUPERMAN TO LIVE.\"--Let\\r\\nthis be our final will at the great noontide!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA. SECOND PART.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"--and only when ye have all denied me, will I return unto you.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, with other eyes, my brethren, shall I then seek my lost ones;\\r\\nwith another love shall I then love you.\"--ZARATHUSTRA, I., \"The\\r\\nBestowing Virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIII. THE CHILD WITH THE MIRROR.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude\\r\\nof his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a sower who\\r\\nhath scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient and full of\\r\\nlonging for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them.\\r\\nFor this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep\\r\\nmodest as a giver.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom meanwhile\\r\\nincreased, and caused him pain by its abundance.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, however, he awoke ere the rosy dawn, and having meditated\\r\\nlong on his couch, at last spake thus to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come to\\r\\nme, carrying a mirror?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra\"--said the child unto me--\"look at thyself in the\\r\\nmirror!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed:\\r\\nfor not myself did I see therein, but a devil\\'s grimace and derision.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, all too well do I understand the dream\\'s portent and monition:\\r\\nmy DOCTRINE is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!\\r\\n\\r\\nMine enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of\\r\\nmy doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I\\r\\ngave them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my lost ones!--\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in\\r\\nanguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the\\r\\nspirit inspireth. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon\\r\\nhim: for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hath happened unto me, mine animals?--said Zarathustra. Am I not\\r\\ntransformed? Hath not bliss come unto me like a whirlwind?\\r\\n\\r\\nFoolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still\\r\\ntoo young--so have patience with it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians unto me!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my friends can I again go down, and also to mine enemies! Zarathustra\\r\\ncan again speak and bestow, and show his best love to his loved ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy impatient love overfloweth in streams,--down towards sunrise and\\r\\nsunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rusheth my\\r\\nsoul into the valleys.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long hath\\r\\nsolitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nUtterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from\\r\\nhigh rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How\\r\\nshould a stream not finally find its way to the sea!\\r\\n\\r\\nForsooth, there is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the\\r\\nstream of my love beareth this along with it, down--to the sea!\\r\\n\\r\\nNew paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired have I become--\\r\\nlike all creators--of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on\\r\\nworn-out soles.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo slowly runneth all speaking for me:--into thy chariot, O storm, do I\\r\\nleap! And even thee will I whip with my spite!\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Happy\\r\\nIsles where my friends sojourn;--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd mine enemies amongst them! How I now love every one unto whom I may\\r\\nbut speak! Even mine enemies pertain to my bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I want to mount my wildest horse, then doth my spear always\\r\\nhelp me up best: it is my foot\\'s ever ready servant:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spear which I hurl at mine enemies! How grateful am I to mine\\r\\nenemies that I may at last hurl it!\\r\\n\\r\\nToo great hath been the tension of my cloud: \\'twixt laughters of\\r\\nlightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nViolently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm\\r\\nover the mountains: thus cometh its assuagement.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, like a storm cometh my happiness, and my freedom! But mine\\r\\nenemies shall think that THE EVIL ONE roareth over their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, ye also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and perhaps\\r\\nye will flee therefrom, along with mine enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds\\' flutes! Ah, that\\r\\nmy lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we already\\r\\nlearned with one another!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome mountains; on the rough\\r\\nstones did she bear the youngest of her young.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow runneth she foolishly in the arid wilderness, and seeketh and\\r\\nseeketh the soft sward--mine old, wild wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the soft sward of your hearts, my friends!--on your love, would she\\r\\nfain couch her dearest one!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIV. IN THE HAPPY ISLES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling\\r\\nthe red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe\\r\\nnow their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and\\r\\nclear sky, and afternoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabundance,\\r\\nit is delightful to look out upon distant seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas; now,\\r\\nhowever, have I taught you to say, Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach beyond\\r\\nyour creating will.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould ye CREATE a God?--Then, I pray you, be silent about all Gods! But\\r\\nye could well create the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot perhaps ye yourselves, my brethren! But into fathers and forefathers\\r\\nof the Superman could ye transform yourselves: and let that be your best\\r\\ncreating!--\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to\\r\\nthe conceivable.\\r\\n\\r\\nCould ye CONCEIVE a God?--But let this mean Will to Truth unto you,\\r\\nthat everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the humanly\\r\\nvisible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall ye follow out\\r\\nto the end!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what ye have called the world shall but be created by you: your\\r\\nreason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And\\r\\nverily, for your bliss, ye discerning ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how would ye endure life without that hope, ye discerning ones?\\r\\nNeither in the inconceivable could ye have been born, nor in the\\r\\nirrational.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that I may reveal my heart entirely unto you, my friends: IF there\\r\\nwere gods, how could I endure it to be no God! THEREFORE there are no\\r\\nGods.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, doth it draw me.--\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this\\r\\nconjecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creating\\r\\none, and from the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is a thought--it maketh all the straight crooked, and all that\\r\\nstandeth reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be\\r\\nbut a lie?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even vomiting\\r\\nto the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjecture\\r\\nsuch a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and\\r\\nthe plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the imperishable--that\\'s but a simile, and the poets lie too much.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of time and of becoming shall the best similes speak: a praise shall\\r\\nthey be, and a justification of all perishableness!\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating--that is the great salvation from suffering, and life\\'s\\r\\nalleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed,\\r\\nand much transformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, much bitter dying must there be in your life, ye creators! Thus are\\r\\nye advocates and justifiers of all perishableness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also\\r\\nbe willing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the\\r\\nchild-bearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred\\r\\ncradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the\\r\\nheart-breaking last hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so willeth it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more\\r\\ncandidly: just such a fate--willeth my Will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll FEELING suffereth in me, and is in prison: but my WILLING ever\\r\\ncometh to me as mine emancipator and comforter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilling emancipateth: that is the true doctrine of will and\\r\\nemancipation--so teacheth you Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah,\\r\\nthat that great debility may ever be far from me!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd also in discerning do I feel only my will\\'s procreating and evolving\\r\\ndelight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is because there\\r\\nis will to procreation in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from God and Gods did this will allure me; what would there be to\\r\\ncreate if there were--Gods!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to man doth it ever impel me anew, my fervent creative will; thus\\r\\nimpelleth it the hammer to the stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, ye men, within the stone slumbereth an image for me, the image of my\\r\\nvisions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow rageth my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone fly\\r\\nthe fragments: what\\'s that to me?\\r\\n\\r\\nI will complete it: for a shadow came unto me--the stillest and lightest\\r\\nof all things once came unto me!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beauty of the Superman came unto me as a shadow. Ah, my brethren! Of\\r\\nwhat account now are--the Gods to me!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXV. THE PITIFUL.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: \"Behold\\r\\nZarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is better said in this wise: \"The discerning one walketh amongst\\r\\nmen AS amongst animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMan himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath had to be\\r\\nashamed too oft?\\r\\n\\r\\nO my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, shame,\\r\\nshame--that is the history of man!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on that account doth the noble one enjoin upon himself not to abash:\\r\\nbashfulness doth he enjoin on himself in presence of all sufferers.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their\\r\\npity: too destitute are they of bashfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is\\r\\npreferably at a distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recognised:\\r\\nand thus do I bid you do, my friends!\\r\\n\\r\\nMay my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path, and\\r\\nthose with whom I MAY have hope and repast and honey in common!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something\\r\\nbetter did I always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself too little:\\r\\nthat alone, my brethren, is our original sin!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best to\\r\\ngive pain unto others, and to contrive pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore do I wash the hand that hath helped the sufferer; therefore do\\r\\nI wipe also my soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor in seeing the sufferer suffering--thereof was I ashamed on account\\r\\nof his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a small\\r\\nkindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing worm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!\"--thus do I advise those\\r\\nwho have naught to bestow.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend to friends.\\r\\nStrangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit\\r\\nfrom my tree: thus doth it cause less shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, it annoyeth\\r\\none to give unto them, and it annoyeth one not to give unto them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the\\r\\nsting of conscience teacheth one to sting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, better to\\r\\nhave done evilly than to have thought pettily!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, ye say: \"The delight in petty evils spareth one many a great\\r\\nevil deed.\" But here one should not wish to be sparing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a boil is the evil deed: it itcheth and irritateth and breaketh\\r\\nforth--it speaketh honourably.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Behold, I am disease,\" saith the evil deed: that is its honourableness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut like infection is the petty thought: it creepeth and hideth, and\\r\\nwanteth to be nowhere--until the whole body is decayed and withered by\\r\\nthe petty infection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this word\\r\\nin the ear: \"Better for thee to rear up thy devil! Even for thee there\\r\\nis still a path to greatness!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, my brethren! One knoweth a little too much about every one! And many\\r\\na one becometh transparent to us, but still we can by no means penetrate\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who\\r\\ndoth not concern us at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, however, thou hast a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for\\r\\nhis suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus wilt thou\\r\\nserve him best.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: \"I forgive thee what thou\\r\\nhast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto THYSELF, however--how\\r\\ncould I forgive that!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speaketh all great love: it surpasseth even forgiveness and pity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne should hold fast one\\'s heart; for when one letteth it go, how\\r\\nquickly doth one\\'s head run away!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the\\r\\npitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the\\r\\nfollies of the pitiful?\\r\\n\\r\\nWoe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their\\r\\npity!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: \"Even God hath his hell:\\r\\nit is his love for man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd lately, did I hear him say these words: \"God is dead: of his pity\\r\\nfor man hath God died.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nSo be ye warned against pity: FROM THENCE there yet cometh unto men a\\r\\nheavy cloud! Verily, I understand weather-signs!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for\\r\\nit seeketh--to create what is loved!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Myself do I offer unto my love, AND MY NEIGHBOUR AS MYSELF\"--such is\\r\\nthe language of all creators.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll creators, however, are hard.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVI. THE PRIESTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples, and spake these\\r\\nwords unto them:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass them quietly\\r\\nand with sleeping swords!\\r\\n\\r\\nEven among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too much--:\\r\\nso they want to make others suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness.\\r\\nAnd readily doth he soil himself who toucheth them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood\\r\\nhonoured in theirs.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long had\\r\\nhe struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt moveth my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but\\r\\nthat is the smallest matter unto me, since I am among men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they unto me,\\r\\nand stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:--\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would\\r\\nsave them from their Saviour!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed them\\r\\nabout; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for\\r\\nmortals--long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and engulfeth whatever\\r\\nhath built tabernacles upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built\\r\\nthemselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul--may not\\r\\nfly aloft to its height!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so enjoineth their belief: \"On your knees, up the stair, ye\\r\\nsinners!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, rather would I see a shameless one than the distorted eyes of\\r\\ntheir shame and devotion!\\r\\n\\r\\nWho created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it not\\r\\nthose who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under the clear\\r\\nsky?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined roofs, and down\\r\\nupon grass and red poppies on ruined walls--will I again turn my heart\\r\\nto the seats of this God.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily, there\\r\\nwas much hero-spirit in their worship!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing men to\\r\\nthe cross!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses;\\r\\neven in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of charnel-houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black pools, wherein\\r\\nthe toad singeth his song with sweet gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their\\r\\nSaviour: more like saved ones would his disciples have to appear unto\\r\\nme!\\r\\n\\r\\nNaked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach\\r\\npenitence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, their Saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom\\'s\\r\\nseventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never trod the carpets of\\r\\nknowledge!\\r\\n\\r\\nOf defects did the spirit of those Saviours consist; but into every\\r\\ndefect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called\\r\\nGod.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and\\r\\no\\'erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great\\r\\nfolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nEagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge;\\r\\nas if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! Verily, those\\r\\nshepherds also were still of the flock!\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my brethren,\\r\\nwhat small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto been!\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their folly\\r\\ntaught that truth is proved by blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood tainteth the purest\\r\\nteaching, and turneth it into delusion and hatred of heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when a person goeth through fire for his teaching--what doth that\\r\\nprove! It is more, verily, when out of one\\'s own burning cometh one\\'s\\r\\nown teaching!\\r\\n\\r\\nSultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there ariseth the\\r\\nblusterer, the \"Saviour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGreater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, than those\\r\\nwhom the people call Saviours, those rapturous blusterers!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd by still greater ones than any of the Saviours must ye be saved, my\\r\\nbrethren, if ye would find the way to freedom!\\r\\n\\r\\nNever yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them,\\r\\nthe greatest man and the smallest man:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAll-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the greatest\\r\\nfound I--all-too-human!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVII. THE VIRTUOUS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and\\r\\nsomnolent senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut beauty\\'s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the most\\r\\nawakened souls.\\r\\n\\r\\nGently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it was beauty\\'s\\r\\nholy laughing and thrilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its\\r\\nvoice unto me: \"They want--to be paid besides!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYe want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want reward for virtue,\\r\\nand heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver,\\r\\nnor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own\\r\\nreward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and\\r\\npunishment been insinuated--and now even into the basis of your souls,\\r\\nye virtuous ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your\\r\\nsouls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when ye\\r\\nlie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be\\r\\nseparated from your truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this is your truth: ye are TOO PURE for the filth of the words:\\r\\nvengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when did one hear\\r\\nof a mother wanting to be paid for her love?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring\\'s thirst is in you: to\\r\\nreach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your virtue: ever\\r\\nis its light on its way and travelling--and when will it cease to be on\\r\\nits way?\\r\\n\\r\\nThus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when its work\\r\\nis done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light liveth and\\r\\ntravelleth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a skin, or\\r\\na cloak: that is the truth from the basis of your souls, ye virtuous\\r\\nones!--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth writhing under\\r\\nthe lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto their crying!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices;\\r\\nand when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs, their \"justice\"\\r\\nbecometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd others are there who are drawn downwards: their devils draw them.\\r\\nBut the more they sink, the more ardently gloweth their eye, and the\\r\\nlonging for their God.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous ones: \"What I\\r\\nam NOT, that, that is God to me, and virtue!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, like carts\\r\\ntaking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity and virtue--their drag\\r\\nthey call virtue!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they\\r\\ntick, and want people to call ticking--virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find such clocks I\\r\\nshall wind them up with my mockery, and they shall even whirr thereby!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, and for the sake\\r\\nof it do violence to all things: so that the world is drowned in their\\r\\nunrighteousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! how ineptly cometh the word \"virtue\" out of their mouth! And when\\r\\nthey say: \"I am just,\" it always soundeth like: \"I am just--revenged!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies;\\r\\nand they elevate themselves only that they may lower others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak thus from\\r\\namong the bulrushes: \"Virtue--that is to sit quietly in the swamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would bite; and in all\\r\\nmatters we have the opinion that is given us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a\\r\\nsort of attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue,\\r\\nbut their heart knoweth naught thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: \"Virtue\\r\\nis necessary\"; but after all they believe only that policemen are\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many a one who cannot see men\\'s loftiness, calleth it virtue to see\\r\\ntheir baseness far too well: thus calleth he his evil eye virtue.--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and\\r\\nothers want to be cast down,--and likewise call it virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at\\r\\nleast every one claimeth to be an authority on \"good\" and \"evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and fools: \"What do\\r\\nYE know of virtue! What COULD ye know of virtue!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that ye, my friends, might become weary of the old words which ye\\r\\nhave learned from the fools and liars:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat ye might become weary of the words \"reward,\" \"retribution,\"\\r\\n\"punishment,\" \"righteous vengeance.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThat ye might become weary of saying: \"That an action is good is because\\r\\nit is unselfish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! my friends! That YOUR very Self be in your action, as the mother is\\r\\nin the child: let that be YOUR formula of virtue!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue\\'s\\r\\nfavourite playthings; and now ye upbraid me, as children upbraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey played by the sea--then came there a wave and swept their\\r\\nplaythings into the deep: and now do they cry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and spread before\\r\\nthem new speckled shells!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus will they be comforted; and like them shall ye also, my friends,\\r\\nhave your comforting--and new speckled shells!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXVIII. THE RABBLE.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all\\r\\nfountains are poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning\\r\\nmouths and the thirst of the unclean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glanceth up to me\\r\\ntheir odious smile out of the fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when they\\r\\ncalled their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the words.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndignant becometh the flame when they put their damp hearts to the\\r\\nfire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when the rabble approach\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nMawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their hands: unsteady, and\\r\\nwithered at the top, doth their look make the fruit-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only turned away\\r\\nfrom the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and fruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst\\r\\nwith beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy\\r\\ncamel-drivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm\\r\\nto all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the\\r\\nrabble, and thus stop their throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to know that life\\r\\nitself requireth enmity and death and torture-crosses:--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? is the\\r\\nrabble also NECESSARY for life?\\r\\n\\r\\nAre poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams,\\r\\nand maggots in the bread of life?\\r\\n\\r\\nNot my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah, ofttimes\\r\\nbecame I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call\\r\\nruling: to traffic and bargain for power--with the rabble!\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so\\r\\nthat the language of their trafficking might remain strange unto me, and\\r\\ntheir bargaining for power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and to-days:\\r\\nverily, badly smell all yesterdays and to-days of the scribbling rabble!\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb--thus have I lived long;\\r\\nthat I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble, and the\\r\\npleasure-rabble.\\r\\n\\r\\nToilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of delight\\r\\nwere its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the blind\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself from loathing?\\r\\nWho hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I flown to the height where no\\r\\nrabble any longer sit at the wells?\\r\\n\\r\\nDid my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining powers?\\r\\nVerily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the well of\\r\\ndelight!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height bubbleth\\r\\nup for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose waters none\\r\\nof the rabble drink with me!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain of delight!\\r\\nAnd often emptiest thou the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far too violently\\r\\ndoth my heart still flow towards thee:--\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, melancholy,\\r\\nover-happy summer: how my summer heart longeth for thy coolness!\\r\\n\\r\\nPast, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my\\r\\nsnowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summer-noontide!\\r\\n\\r\\nA summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful\\r\\nstillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more\\r\\nblissful!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this is OUR height and our home: too high and steep do we here dwell\\r\\nfor all uncleanly ones and their thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How\\r\\ncould it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with ITS\\r\\npurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us lone\\r\\nones food in their beaks!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, no food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire,\\r\\nwould they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, no abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave to\\r\\ntheir bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as strong winds will we live above them, neighbours to the eagles,\\r\\nneighbours to the snow, neighbours to the sun: thus live the strong\\r\\nwinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit,\\r\\ntake the breath from their spirit: thus willeth my future.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this counsel\\r\\ncounselleth he to his enemies, and to whatever spitteth and speweth:\\r\\n\"Take care not to spit AGAINST the wind!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXIX. THE TARANTULAS.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo, this is the tarantula\\'s den! Wouldst thou see the tarantula itself?\\r\\nHere hangeth its web: touch this, so that it may tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere cometh the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! Black on thy\\r\\nback is thy triangle and symbol; and I know also what is in thy soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenge is in thy soul: wherever thou bitest, there ariseth black scab;\\r\\nwith revenge, thy poison maketh the soul giddy!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus do I speak unto you in parable, ye who make the soul giddy,\\r\\nye preachers of EQUALITY! Tarantulas are ye unto me, and secretly\\r\\nrevengeful ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: therefore do I\\r\\nlaugh in your face my laughter of the height.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you out of your\\r\\nden of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your word\\r\\n\"justice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause, FOR MAN TO BE REDEEMED FROM REVENGE--that is for me the bridge\\r\\nto the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. \"Let it be\\r\\nvery justice for the world to become full of the storms of our\\r\\nvengeance\"--thus do they talk to one another.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like\\r\\nus\"--thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And \\'Will to Equality\\'--that itself shall henceforth be the name of\\r\\nvirtue; and against all that hath power will we raise an outcry!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYe preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence crieth thus in\\r\\nyou for \"equality\": your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves\\r\\nthus in virtue-words!\\r\\n\\r\\nFretted conceit and suppressed envy--perhaps your fathers\\' conceit and\\r\\nenvy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the father hath hid cometh out in the son; and oft have I found in\\r\\nthe son the father\\'s revealed secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspireth\\r\\nthem--but vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not\\r\\nspirit, but envy, that maketh them so.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir jealousy leadeth them also into thinkers\\' paths; and this is the\\r\\nsign of their jealousy--they always go too far: so that their fatigue\\r\\nhath at last to go to sleep on the snow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their eulogies is\\r\\nmaleficence; and being judge seemeth to them bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse\\r\\nto punish is powerful!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances peer\\r\\nthe hangman and the sleuth-hound.\\r\\n\\r\\nDistrust all those who talk much of their justice! Verily, in their\\r\\nsouls not only honey is lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they call themselves \"the good and just,\" forget not, that for\\r\\nthem to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but--power!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at the same time\\r\\npreachers of equality, and tarantulas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their den, these\\r\\npoison-spiders, and withdrawn from life--is because they would thereby\\r\\ndo injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those would they thereby do injury who have power at present: for\\r\\nwith those the preaching of death is still most at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nWere it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach otherwise: and they\\r\\nthemselves were formerly the best world-maligners and heretic-burners.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded.\\r\\nFor thus speaketh justice UNTO ME: \"Men are not equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd neither shall they become so! What would be my love to the Superman,\\r\\nif I spake otherwise?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future, and\\r\\nalways shall there be more war and inequality among them: thus doth my\\r\\ngreat love make me speak!\\r\\n\\r\\nInventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities;\\r\\nand with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other\\r\\nthe supreme fight!\\r\\n\\r\\nGood and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and all names of\\r\\nvalues: weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, that life must again\\r\\nand again surpass itself!\\r\\n\\r\\nAloft will it build itself with columns and stairs--life itself: into\\r\\nremote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful beauties--\\r\\nTHEREFORE doth it require elevation!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd because it requireth elevation, therefore doth it require steps, and\\r\\nvariance of steps and climbers! To rise striveth life, and in rising to\\r\\nsurpass itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula\\'s den is, riseth\\r\\naloft an ancient temple\\'s ruins--just behold it with enlightened eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, he who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, knew as well as\\r\\nthe wisest ones about the secret of life!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there is struggle and inequality even in beauty, and war for power\\r\\nand supremacy: that doth he here teach us in the plainest parable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with\\r\\nlight and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving\\r\\nones.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, steadfast and beautiful, let us also be enemies, my friends!\\r\\nDivinely will we strive AGAINST one another!--\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! There hath the tarantula bit me myself, mine old enemy! Divinely\\r\\nsteadfast and beautiful, it hath bit me on the finger!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Punishment must there be, and justice\"--so thinketh it: \"not\\r\\ngratuitously shall he here sing songs in honour of enmity!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, it hath revenged itself! And alas! now will it make my soul also\\r\\ndizzy with revenge!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I may NOT turn dizzy, however, bind me fast, my friends, to this\\r\\npillar! Rather will I be a pillar-saint than a whirl of vengeance!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, no cyclone or whirlwind is Zarathustra: and if he be a dancer,\\r\\nhe is not at all a tarantula-dancer!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXX. THE FAMOUS WISE ONES.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people have ye served and the people\\'s superstition--NOT the\\r\\ntruth!--all ye famous wise ones! And just on that account did they pay\\r\\nyou reverence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief, because it\\r\\nwas a pleasantry and a by-path for the people. Thus doth the master give\\r\\nfree scope to his slaves, and even enjoyeth their presumptuousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs--is the free\\r\\nspirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the dweller in the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo hunt him out of his lair--that was always called \"sense of right\" by\\r\\nthe people: on him do they still hound their sharpest-toothed dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For there the truth is, where the people are! Woe, woe to the seeking\\r\\nones!\"--thus hath it echoed through all time.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour people would ye justify in their reverence: that called ye \"Will to\\r\\nTruth,\" ye famous wise ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd your heart hath always said to itself: \"From the people have I come:\\r\\nfrom thence came to me also the voice of God.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStiff-necked and artful, like the ass, have ye always been, as the\\r\\nadvocates of the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many a powerful one who wanted to run well with the people, hath\\r\\nharnessed in front of his horses--a donkey, a famous wise man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, ye famous wise ones, I would have you finally throw off\\r\\nentirely the skin of the lion!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin of the beast of prey, the speckled skin, and the dishevelled\\r\\nlocks of the investigator, the searcher, and the conqueror!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! for me to learn to believe in your \"conscientiousness,\" ye would\\r\\nfirst have to break your venerating will.\\r\\n\\r\\nConscientious--so call I him who goeth into God-forsaken wildernesses,\\r\\nand hath broken his venerating heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the yellow sands and burnt by the sun, he doubtless peereth thirstily\\r\\nat the isles rich in fountains, where life reposeth under shady trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his thirst doth not persuade him to become like those comfortable\\r\\nones: for where there are oases, there are also idols.\\r\\n\\r\\nHungry, fierce, lonesome, God-forsaken: so doth the lion-will wish\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree from the happiness of slaves, redeemed from Deities and adorations,\\r\\nfearless and fear-inspiring, grand and lonesome: so is the will of the\\r\\nconscientious.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wilderness have ever dwelt the conscientious, the free spirits,\\r\\nas lords of the wilderness; but in the cities dwell the well-foddered,\\r\\nfamous wise ones--the draught-beasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor, always, do they draw, as asses--the PEOPLE\\'S carts!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that I on that account upbraid them: but serving ones do they\\r\\nremain, and harnessed ones, even though they glitter in golden harness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd often have they been good servants and worthy of their hire. For\\r\\nthus saith virtue: \"If thou must be a servant, seek him unto whom thy\\r\\nservice is most useful!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spirit and virtue of thy master shall advance by thou being his\\r\\nservant: thus wilt thou thyself advance with his spirit and virtue!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, ye famous wise ones, ye servants of the people! Ye\\r\\nyourselves have advanced with the people\\'s spirit and virtue--and the\\r\\npeople by you! To your honour do I say it!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the people ye remain for me, even with your virtues, the people with\\r\\npurblind eyes--the people who know not what SPIRIT is!\\r\\n\\r\\nSpirit is life which itself cutteth into life: by its own torture doth\\r\\nit increase its own knowledge,--did ye know that before?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the spirit\\'s happiness is this: to be anointed and consecrated with\\r\\ntears as a sacrificial victim,--did ye know that before?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the blindness of the blind one, and his seeking and groping, shall\\r\\nyet testify to the power of the sun into which he hath gazed,--did ye\\r\\nknow that before?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with mountains shall the discerning one learn to BUILD! It is\\r\\na small thing for the spirit to remove mountains,--did ye know that\\r\\nbefore?\\r\\n\\r\\nYe know only the sparks of the spirit: but ye do not see the anvil which\\r\\nit is, and the cruelty of its hammer!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, ye know not the spirit\\'s pride! But still less could ye endure\\r\\nthe spirit\\'s humility, should it ever want to speak!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd never yet could ye cast your spirit into a pit of snow: ye are not\\r\\nhot enough for that! Thus are ye unaware, also, of the delight of its\\r\\ncoldness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all respects, however, ye make too familiar with the spirit; and out\\r\\nof wisdom have ye often made an almshouse and a hospital for bad poets.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe are not eagles: thus have ye never experienced the happiness of the\\r\\nalarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should not camp above\\r\\nabysses.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe seem to me lukewarm ones: but coldly floweth all deep knowledge.\\r\\nIce-cold are the innermost wells of the spirit: a refreshment to hot\\r\\nhands and handlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nRespectable do ye there stand, and stiff, and with straight backs, ye\\r\\nfamous wise ones!--no strong wind or will impelleth you.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ye ne\\'er seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and inflated, and\\r\\ntrembling with the violence of the wind?\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit, doth my wisdom\\r\\ncross the sea--my wild wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ye servants of the people, ye famous wise ones--how COULD ye go with\\r\\nme!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXI. THE NIGHT-SONG.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also\\r\\nis a gushing fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake. And my soul\\r\\nalso is the song of a loving one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething unappeased, unappeasable, is within me; it longeth to find\\r\\nexpression. A craving for love is within me, which speaketh itself the\\r\\nlanguage of love.\\r\\n\\r\\nLight am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness to be\\r\\nbegirt with light!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at the breasts of\\r\\nlight!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and glow-worms\\r\\naloft!--and would rejoice in the gifts of your light.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I live in mine own light, I drink again into myself the flames that\\r\\nbreak forth from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I dreamt that\\r\\nstealing must be more blessed than receiving.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing; it is mine envy\\r\\nthat I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of longing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, the misery of all bestowers! Oh, the darkening of my sun! Oh, the\\r\\ncraving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a gap \\'twixt\\r\\ngiving and receiving; and the smallest gap hath finally to be bridged\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hunger ariseth out of my beauty: I should like to injure those I\\r\\nillumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted:--thus do I hunger\\r\\nfor wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithdrawing my hand when another hand already stretcheth out to it;\\r\\nhesitating like the cascade, which hesitateth even in its leap:--thus do\\r\\nI hunger for wickedness!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch revenge doth mine abundance think of: such mischief welleth out of\\r\\nmy lonesomeness.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy happiness in bestowing died in bestowing; my virtue became weary of\\r\\nitself by its abundance!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who ever bestoweth is in danger of losing his shame; to him who ever\\r\\ndispenseth, the hand and heart become callous by very dispensing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMine eye no longer overfloweth for the shame of suppliants; my hand hath\\r\\nbecome too hard for the trembling of filled hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of my heart? Oh,\\r\\nthe lonesomeness of all bestowers! Oh, the silence of all shining ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nMany suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they speak with\\r\\ntheir light--but to me they are silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly doth\\r\\nit pursue its course.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the\\r\\nsuns:--thus travelleth every sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling.\\r\\nTheir inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, ye only is it, ye dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the\\r\\nshining ones! Oh, ye only drink milk and refreshment from the light\\'s\\r\\nudders!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, there is ice around me; my hand burneth with the iciness! Ah, there\\r\\nis thirst in me; it panteth after your thirst!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly!\\r\\nAnd lonesomeness!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: now doth my longing break forth in me as a fountain,--for\\r\\nspeech do I long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also\\r\\nis a gushing fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is\\r\\nthe song of a loving one.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXII. THE DANCE-SONG.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and\\r\\nwhen he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully\\r\\nsurrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together.\\r\\nAs soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing;\\r\\nZarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spake these\\r\\nwords:\\r\\n\\r\\nCease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler hath come to\\r\\nyou with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod\\'s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of\\r\\ngravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances?\\r\\nOr to maidens\\' feet with fine ankles?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not\\r\\nafraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens: beside\\r\\nthe well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he\\r\\nperhaps chased butterflies too much?\\r\\n\\r\\nUpbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God\\r\\nsomewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep--but he is laughable even\\r\\nwhen weeping!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself\\r\\nwill sing a song to his dance:\\r\\n\\r\\nA dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest,\\r\\npowerfulest devil, who is said to be \"lord of the world.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens\\r\\ndanced together:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable did\\r\\nI there seem to sink.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively didst thou\\r\\nlaugh when I called thee unfathomable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Such is the language of all fish,\" saidst thou; \"what THEY do not\\r\\nfathom is unfathomable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no\\r\\nvirtuous one:\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I be called by you men the \\'profound one,\\' or the \\'faithful one,\\'\\r\\n\\'the eternal one,\\' \\'the mysterious one.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ye men endow us always with your own virtues--alas, ye virtuous\\r\\nones!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her and\\r\\nher laughter, when she speaketh evil of herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me\\r\\nangrily: \"Thou willest, thou cravest, thou lovest; on that account alone\\r\\ndost thou PRAISE Life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry\\r\\none; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one \"telleth the\\r\\ntruth\" to one\\'s Wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only\\r\\nLife--and verily, most when I hate her!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she\\r\\nremindeth me very strongly of Life!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I\\r\\nresponsible for it that both are so alike?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when once Life asked me: \"Who is she then, this Wisdom?\"--then said\\r\\nI eagerly: \"Ah, yes! Wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh through veils,\\r\\none graspeth through nets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still lured\\r\\nby her.\\r\\n\\r\\nChangeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip, and\\r\\npass the comb against the grain of her hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she\\r\\nspeaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce most.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had said this unto Life, then laughed she maliciously, and shut\\r\\nher eyes. \"Of whom dost thou speak?\" said she. \"Perhaps of me?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if thou wert right--is it proper to say THAT in such wise to my\\r\\nface! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved Life! And into\\r\\nthe unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens had\\r\\ndeparted, he became sad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The sun hath been long set,\" said he at last, \"the meadow is damp, and\\r\\nfrom the forest cometh coolness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. What! Thou\\r\\nlivest still, Zarathustra?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly still to\\r\\nlive?--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me.\\r\\nForgive me my sadness!\\r\\n\\r\\nEvening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come on!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIII. THE GRAVE-SONG.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yonder is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are the graves\\r\\nof my youth. Thither will I carry an evergreen wreath of life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nResolving thus in my heart, did I sail o\\'er the sea.--\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, ye sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all ye gleams of love, ye\\r\\ndivine fleeting gleams! How could ye perish so soon for me! I think of\\r\\nyou to-day as my dead ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom you, my dearest dead ones, cometh unto me a sweet savour,\\r\\nheart-opening and melting. Verily, it convulseth and openeth the heart\\r\\nof the lone seafarer.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill am I the richest and most to be envied--I, the lonesomest one!\\r\\nFor I HAVE POSSESSED you, and ye possess me still. Tell me: to whom hath\\r\\nthere ever fallen such rosy apples from the tree as have fallen unto me?\\r\\n\\r\\nStill am I your love\\'s heir and heritage, blooming to your memory with\\r\\nmany-hued, wild-growing virtues, O ye dearest ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, we were made to remain nigh unto each other, ye kindly strange\\r\\nmarvels; and not like timid birds did ye come to me and my longing--nay,\\r\\nbut as trusting ones to a trusting one!\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, made for faithfulness, like me, and for fond eternities, must I now\\r\\nname you by your faithlessness, ye divine glances and fleeting gleams:\\r\\nno other name have I yet learnt.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, too early did ye die for me, ye fugitives. Yet did ye not flee\\r\\nfrom me, nor did I flee from you: innocent are we to each other in our\\r\\nfaithlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo kill ME, did they strangle you, ye singing birds of my hopes! Yea, at\\r\\nyou, ye dearest ones, did malice ever shoot its arrows--to hit my heart!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they hit it! Because ye were always my dearest, my possession and my\\r\\npossessedness: ON THAT ACCOUNT had ye to die young, and far too early!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow--namely, at you,\\r\\nwhose skin is like down--or more like the smile that dieth at a glance!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this word will I say unto mine enemies: What is all manslaughter in\\r\\ncomparison with what ye have done unto me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWorse evil did ye do unto me than all manslaughter; the irretrievable\\r\\ndid ye take from me:--thus do I speak unto you, mine enemies!\\r\\n\\r\\nSlew ye not my youth\\'s visions and dearest marvels! My playmates took ye\\r\\nfrom me, the blessed spirits! To their memory do I deposit this wreath\\r\\nand this curse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis curse upon you, mine enemies! Have ye not made mine eternal short,\\r\\nas a tone dieth away in a cold night! Scarcely, as the twinkle of divine\\r\\neyes, did it come to me--as a fleeting gleam!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake once in a happy hour my purity: \"Divine shall everything be\\r\\nunto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did ye haunt me with foul phantoms; ah, whither hath that happy\\r\\nhour now fled!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All days shall be holy unto me\"--so spake once the wisdom of my youth:\\r\\nverily, the language of a joyous wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then did ye enemies steal my nights, and sold them to sleepless\\r\\ntorture: ah, whither hath that joyous wisdom now fled?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce did I long for happy auspices: then did ye lead an owl-monster\\r\\nacross my path, an adverse sign. Ah, whither did my tender longing then\\r\\nflee?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did ye change my nigh ones\\r\\nand nearest ones into ulcerations. Ah, whither did my noblest vow then\\r\\nflee?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did ye cast\\r\\nfilth on the blind one\\'s course: and now is he disgusted with the old\\r\\nfootpath.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the triumph of\\r\\nmy victories, then did ye make those who loved me call out that I then\\r\\ngrieved them most.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, it was always your doing: ye embittered to me my best honey, and\\r\\nthe diligence of my best bees.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars; around my\\r\\nsympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably shameless. Thus have ye\\r\\nwounded the faith of my virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately did your\\r\\n\"piety\" put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest suffocated in\\r\\nthe fumes of your fat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced: beyond all\\r\\nheavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my favourite minstrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now hath he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, he tooted as a\\r\\nmournful horn to mine ear!\\r\\n\\r\\nMurderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent instrument!\\r\\nAlready did I stand prepared for the best dance: then didst thou slay my\\r\\nrapture with thy tones!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of the highest\\r\\nthings:--and now hath my grandest parable remained unspoken in my limbs!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained! And there have\\r\\nperished for me all the visions and consolations of my youth!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow did I ever bear it? How did I survive and surmount such wounds? How\\r\\ndid my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, something that would\\r\\nrend rocks asunder: it is called MY WILL. Silently doth it proceed, and\\r\\nunchanged throughout the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts course will it go upon my feet, mine old Will; hard of heart is its\\r\\nnature and invulnerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever livest thou there, and art like\\r\\nthyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou burst all shackles of the\\r\\ntomb!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life\\r\\nand youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to thee,\\r\\nmy Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIV. SELF-SURPASSING.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Will to Truth\" do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which impelleth you\\r\\nand maketh you ardent?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill for the thinkableness of all being: thus do _I_ call your will!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll being would ye MAKE thinkable: for ye doubt with good reason whether\\r\\nit be already thinkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willeth your will.\\r\\nSmooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even\\r\\nwhen ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe would still create a world before which ye can bow the knee: such is\\r\\nyour ultimate hope and ecstasy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ignorant, to be sure, the people--they are like a river on which a\\r\\nboat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn\\r\\nand disguised.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour will and your valuations have ye put on the river of becoming; it\\r\\nbetrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people\\r\\nas good and evil.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave\\r\\nthem pomp and proud names--ye and your ruling Will!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnward the river now carrieth your boat: it MUST carry it. A small\\r\\nmatter if the rough wave foameth and angrily resisteth its keel!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and\\r\\nevil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power--the\\r\\nunexhausted, procreating life-will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for that purpose\\r\\nwill I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature of all living\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and narrowest\\r\\npaths to learn its nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its mouth was\\r\\nshut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its eye spake unto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language of\\r\\nobedience. All living things are obeying things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded.\\r\\nSuch is the nature of living things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, however, is the third thing which I heard--namely, that commanding\\r\\nis more difficult than obeying. And not only because the commander\\r\\nbeareth the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden readily\\r\\ncrusheth him:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAn attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and whenever it\\r\\ncommandeth, the living thing risketh itself thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it atone for its\\r\\ncommanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and\\r\\nvictim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow doth this happen! so did I ask myself. What persuadeth the living\\r\\nthing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?\\r\\n\\r\\nHearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether\\r\\nI have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its\\r\\nheart!\\r\\n\\r\\nWherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even\\r\\nin the will of the servant found I the will to be master.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat to the stronger the weaker shall serve--thereto persuadeth he his\\r\\nwill who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he\\r\\nis unwilling to forego.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that he may have\\r\\ndelight and power over the least of all, so doth even the greatest\\r\\nsurrender himself, and staketh--life, for the sake of power.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, and play\\r\\ndice for death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, there also\\r\\nis the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker then slink into\\r\\nthe fortress, and into the heart of the mightier one--and there stealeth\\r\\npower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this secret spake Life herself unto me. \"Behold,\" said she, \"I am\\r\\nthat WHICH MUST EVER SURPASS ITSELF.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal,\\r\\ntowards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the\\r\\nsame secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and verily, where\\r\\nthere is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there doth Life sacrifice\\r\\nitself--for power!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and\\r\\ncross-purpose--ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also on what\\r\\nCROOKED paths it hath to tread!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever I create, and however much I love it,--soon must I be adverse\\r\\nto it, and to my love: so willeth my will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even thou, discerning one, art only a path and footstep of my will:\\r\\nverily, my Will to Power walketh even on the feet of thy Will to Truth!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: \\'Will to\\r\\nexistence\\': that will--doth not exist!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence--how\\r\\ncould it still strive for existence!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to\\r\\nLife, but--so teach I thee--Will to Power!\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of\\r\\nthe very reckoning speaketh--the Will to Power!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, do I solve you\\r\\nthe riddle of your hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be everlasting--it\\r\\ndoth not exist! Of its own accord must it ever surpass itself anew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise power,\\r\\nye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling,\\r\\ntrembling, and overflowing of your souls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new surpassing:\\r\\nby it breaketh egg and egg-shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who hath to be a creator in good and evil--verily, he hath first\\r\\nto be a destroyer, and break values in pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: that, however,\\r\\nis the creating good.--\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us SPEAK thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. To be\\r\\nsilent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let everything break up which--can break up by our truths! Many a\\r\\nhouse is still to be built!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXV. THE SUBLIME ONES.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hideth droll\\r\\nmonsters!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnmoved is my depth: but it sparkleth with swimming enigmas and\\r\\nlaughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sublime one saw I to-day, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh,\\r\\nhow my soul laughed at his ugliness!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did\\r\\nhe stand, the sublime one, and in silence:\\r\\n\\r\\nO\\'erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn\\r\\nraiment; many thorns also hung on him--but I saw no rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did this hunter\\r\\nreturn from the forest of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even yet a wild\\r\\nbeast gazeth out of his seriousness--an unconquered wild beast!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a tiger doth he ever stand, on the point of springing; but I do not\\r\\nlike those strained souls; ungracious is my taste towards all those\\r\\nself-engrossed ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ye tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about taste and\\r\\ntasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!\\r\\n\\r\\nTaste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas\\r\\nfor every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and\\r\\nscales and weigher!\\r\\n\\r\\nShould he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime one, then only\\r\\nwill his beauty begin--and then only will I taste him and find him\\r\\nsavoury.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd only when he turneth away from himself will he o\\'erleap his own\\r\\nshadow--and verily! into HIS sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the penitent of the\\r\\nspirit became pale; he almost starved on his expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\nContempt is still in his eye, and loathing hideth in his mouth. To be\\r\\nsure, he now resteth, but he hath not yet taken rest in the sunshine.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of the earth,\\r\\nand not of contempt for the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and lowing,\\r\\nwalketh before the plough-share: and his lowing should also laud all\\r\\nthat is earthly!\\r\\n\\r\\nDark is still his countenance; the shadow of his hand danceth upon it.\\r\\nO\\'ershadowed is still the sense of his eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing obscureth the\\r\\ndoer. Not yet hath he overcome his deed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox: but now do I want to\\r\\nsee also the eye of the angel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso his hero-will hath he still to unlearn: an exalted one shall he\\r\\nbe, and not only a sublime one:--the ether itself should raise him, the\\r\\nwill-less one!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hath subdued monsters, he hath solved enigmas. But he should also\\r\\nredeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly children should he\\r\\ntransform them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without\\r\\njealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become calm in beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, but in\\r\\nbeauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of the magnanimous.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis arm across his head: thus should the hero repose; thus should he\\r\\nalso surmount his repose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut precisely to the hero is BEAUTY the hardest thing of all.\\r\\nUnattainable is beauty by all ardent wills.\\r\\n\\r\\nA little more, a little less: precisely this is much here, it is the\\r\\nmost here.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: that is the\\r\\nhardest for all of you, ye sublime ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen power becometh gracious and descendeth into the visible--I call\\r\\nsuch condescension, beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee, thou powerful\\r\\none: let thy goodness be thy last self-conquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll evil do I accredit to thee: therefore do I desire of thee the good.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves good\\r\\nbecause they have crippled paws!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe virtue of the pillar shalt thou strive after: more beautiful doth\\r\\nit ever become, and more graceful--but internally harder and more\\r\\nsustaining--the higher it riseth.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, thou sublime one, one day shalt thou also be beautiful, and hold up\\r\\nthe mirror to thine own beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen will thy soul thrill with divine desires; and there will be\\r\\nadoration even in thy vanity!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this is the secret of the soul: when the hero hath abandoned it,\\r\\nthen only approacheth it in dreams--the superhero.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVI. THE LAND OF CULTURE.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I looked around me, lo! there time was my sole contemporary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did I fly backwards, homewards--and always faster. Thus did I come\\r\\nunto you, ye present-day men, and into the land of culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire: verily,\\r\\nwith longing in my heart did I come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed--I had yet to\\r\\nlaugh! Never did mine eye see anything so motley-coloured!\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as\\r\\nwell. \"Here forsooth, is the home of all the paintpots,\"--said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith fifty patches painted on faces and limbs--so sat ye there to mine\\r\\nastonishment, ye present-day men!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of colours,\\r\\nand repeated it!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, than your own\\r\\nfaces! Who could--RECOGNISE you!\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten all over with the characters of the past, and these characters\\r\\nalso pencilled over with new characters--thus have ye concealed\\r\\nyourselves well from all decipherers!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth that ye have\\r\\nreins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; all\\r\\ncustoms and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures,\\r\\nwould just have enough left to scare the crows.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without\\r\\npaint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and among the\\r\\nshades of the by-gone!--Fatter and fuller than ye, are forsooth the\\r\\nnether-worldlings!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure\\r\\nyou naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh strayed birds\\r\\nshiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your \"reality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thus speak ye: \"Real are we wholly, and without faith and\\r\\nsuperstition\": thus do ye plume yourselves--alas! even without plumes!\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, how would ye be ABLE to believe, ye divers-coloured ones!--ye\\r\\nwho are pictures of all that hath ever been believed!\\r\\n\\r\\nPerambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dislocation of\\r\\nall thought. UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES: thus do _I_ call you, ye real ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams\\r\\nand pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfruitful are ye: THEREFORE do ye lack belief. But he who had to\\r\\ncreate, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions--and\\r\\nbelieved in believing!--\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf-open doors are ye, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is YOUR\\r\\nreality: \"Everything deserveth to perish.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, how ye stand there before me, ye unfruitful ones; how lean your\\r\\nribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a one hath said: \"There hath surely a God filched something from\\r\\nme secretly whilst I slept? Verily, enough to make a girl for himself\\r\\ntherefrom!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!\" thus hath spoken many a present-day\\r\\nman.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, ye are laughable unto me, ye present-day men! And especially when\\r\\nye marvel at yourselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd woe unto me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to\\r\\nswallow all that is repugnant in your platters!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry\\r\\nwhat is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also alight on my\\r\\nload!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, it shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not from\\r\\nyou, ye present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, whither shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do I\\r\\nlook out for fatherlands and motherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and\\r\\ndecamping at all gates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late my\\r\\nheart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus do I love only my CHILDREN\\'S LAND, the undiscovered in the remotest\\r\\nsea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers:\\r\\nand unto all the future--for THIS present-day!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVII. IMMACULATE PERCEPTION.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen yester-eve the moon arose, then did I fancy it about to bear a sun:\\r\\nso broad and teeming did it lie on the horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was a liar with its pregnancy; and sooner will I believe in the\\r\\nman in the moon than in the woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, little of a man is he also, that timid night-reveller.\\r\\nVerily, with a bad conscience doth he stalk over the roofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; covetous of the\\r\\nearth, and all the joys of lovers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNay, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful unto me are all\\r\\nthat slink around half-closed windows!\\r\\n\\r\\nPiously and silently doth he stalk along on the star-carpets:--but I\\r\\nlike no light-treading human feet, on which not even a spur jingleth.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery honest one\\'s step speaketh; the cat however, stealeth along over\\r\\nthe ground. Lo! cat-like doth the moon come along, and dishonestly.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThis parable speak I unto you sentimental dissemblers, unto you, the\\r\\n\"pure discerners!\" You do _I_ call--covetous ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso ye love the earth, and the earthly: I have divined you well!--but\\r\\nshame is in your love, and a bad conscience--ye are like the moon!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo despise the earthly hath your spirit been persuaded, but not your\\r\\nbowels: these, however, are the strongest in you!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels, and\\r\\ngoeth by-ways and lying ways to escape its own shame.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That would be the highest thing for me\"--so saith your lying spirit\\r\\nunto itself--\"to gaze upon life without desire, and not like the dog,\\r\\nwith hanging-out tongue:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and greed\\r\\nof selfishness--cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated\\r\\nmoon-eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat would be the dearest thing to me\"--thus doth the seduced one seduce\\r\\nhimself,--\"to love the earth as the moon loveth it, and with the eye\\r\\nonly to feel its beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this do I call IMMACULATE perception of all things: to want nothing\\r\\nelse from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a\\r\\nhundred facets.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, ye sentimental dissemblers, ye covetous ones! Ye lack innocence in\\r\\nyour desire: and now do ye defame desiring on that account!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do ye love the\\r\\nearth!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who\\r\\nseeketh to create beyond himself, hath for me the purest will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is beauty? Where I MUST WILL with my whole Will; where I will love\\r\\nand perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love:\\r\\nthat is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak unto you cowards!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now doth your emasculated ogling profess to be \"contemplation!\"\\r\\nAnd that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened\\r\\n\"beautiful!\" Oh, ye violators of noble names!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it shall be your curse, ye immaculate ones, ye pure discerners, that\\r\\nye shall never bring forth, even though ye lie broad and teeming on the\\r\\nhorizon!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, ye fill your mouth with noble words: and we are to believe that\\r\\nyour heart overfloweth, ye cozeners?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut MY words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: gladly do I pick\\r\\nup what falleth from the table at your repasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet still can I say therewith the truth--to dissemblers! Yea, my\\r\\nfish-bones, shells, and prickly leaves shall--tickle the noses of\\r\\ndissemblers!\\r\\n\\r\\nBad air is always about you and your repasts: your lascivious thoughts,\\r\\nyour lies, and secrets are indeed in the air!\\r\\n\\r\\nDare only to believe in yourselves--in yourselves and in your inward\\r\\nparts! He who doth not believe in himself always lieth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA God\\'s mask have ye hung in front of you, ye \"pure ones\": into a God\\'s\\r\\nmask hath your execrable coiling snake crawled.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily ye deceive, ye \"contemplative ones!\" Even Zarathustra was once\\r\\nthe dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not divine the serpent\\'s coil\\r\\nwith which it was stuffed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA God\\'s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, ye pure\\r\\ndiscerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your arts!\\r\\n\\r\\nSerpents\\' filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from me: and that\\r\\na lizard\\'s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I came NIGH unto you: then came to me the day,--and now cometh it to\\r\\nyou,--at an end is the moon\\'s love affair!\\r\\n\\r\\nSee there! Surprised and pale doth it stand--before the rosy dawn!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor already she cometh, the glowing one,--HER love to the earth cometh!\\r\\nInnocence and creative desire, is all solar love!\\r\\n\\r\\nSee there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye not feel the\\r\\nthirst and the hot breath of her love?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: now\\r\\nriseth the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nKissed and sucked WOULD it be by the thirst of the sun; vapour WOULD it\\r\\nbecome, and height, and path of light, and light itself!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this meaneth TO ME knowledge: all that is deep shall ascend--to my\\r\\nheight!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXVIII. SCHOLARS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my\\r\\nhead,--it ate, and said thereby: \"Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall,\\r\\namong thistles and red poppies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and red\\r\\npoppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so willeth my lot--blessings\\r\\nupon it!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the scholars,\\r\\nand the door have I also slammed behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I got\\r\\nthe knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep on\\r\\nox-skins than on their honours and dignities.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am too hot and scorched with mine own thought: often is it ready to\\r\\ntake away my breath. Then have I to go into the open air, and away from\\r\\nall dusty rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything to be\\r\\nmerely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun burneth on the\\r\\nsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: thus do\\r\\nthey also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others have thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like flour-sacks,\\r\\nand involuntarily: but who would divine that their dust came from corn,\\r\\nand from the yellow delight of the summer fields?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty sayings and\\r\\ntruths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it came\\r\\nfrom the swamp; and verily, I have even heard the frog croak in it!\\r\\n\\r\\nClever are they--they have dexterous fingers: what doth MY simplicity\\r\\npretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading and knitting and\\r\\nweaving do their fingers understand: thus do they make the hose of the\\r\\nspirit!\\r\\n\\r\\nGood clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up properly!\\r\\nThen do they indicate the hour without mistake, and make a modest noise\\r\\nthereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike millstones do they work, and like pestles: throw only seed-corn\\r\\nunto them!--they know well how to grind corn small, and make white dust\\r\\nout of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the\\r\\nbest. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge\\r\\nwalketh on lame feet,--like spiders do they wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always did\\r\\nthey put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find\\r\\nthem playing, that they perspired thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to\\r\\nmy taste than their falsehoods and false dice.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did\\r\\nthey take a dislike to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and so\\r\\nthey put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me and their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto\\r\\nbeen heard by the most learned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll mankind\\'s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt themselves and\\r\\nme:--they call it \"false ceiling\" in their houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut nevertheless I walk with my thoughts ABOVE their heads; and even\\r\\nshould I walk on mine own errors, still would I be above them and their\\r\\nheads.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor men are NOT equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, THEY may\\r\\nnot will!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXXXIX. POETS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Since I have known the body better\"--said Zarathustra to one of his\\r\\ndisciples--\"the spirit hath only been to me symbolically spirit; and all\\r\\nthe \\'imperishable\\'--that is also but a simile.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So have I heard thee say once before,\" answered the disciple, \"and then\\r\\nthou addedst: \\'But the poets lie too much.\\' Why didst thou say that the\\r\\npoets lie too much?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why?\" said Zarathustra. \"Thou askest why? I do not belong to those who\\r\\nmay be asked after their Why.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced the\\r\\nreasons for mine opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nShould I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my\\r\\nreasons with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; and many a\\r\\nbird flieth away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote, which\\r\\nis alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my hand upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets lie too\\r\\nmuch?--But Zarathustra also is a poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelievest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou believe it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disciple answered: \"I believe in Zarathustra.\" But Zarathustra shook\\r\\nhis head and smiled.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBelief doth not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie\\r\\ntoo much: he was right--WE do lie too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to lie.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous\\r\\nhotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing hath\\r\\nthere been done.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart with\\r\\nthe poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one\\r\\nanother in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which CHOKETH\\r\\nUP for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people and in\\r\\ntheir \"wisdom.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh up his ears\\r\\nwhen lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth something of the\\r\\nthings that are betwixt heaven and earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the poets always\\r\\nthink that nature herself is in love with them:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, and\\r\\namorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride themselves, before\\r\\nall mortals!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, there are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of which only the\\r\\npoets have dreamed!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd especially ABOVE the heavens: for all Gods are poet-symbolisations,\\r\\npoet-sophistications!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, ever are we drawn aloft--that is, to the realm of the clouds:\\r\\non these do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call them Gods and\\r\\nSupermen:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAre not they light enough for those chairs!--all these Gods and\\r\\nSupermen?--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual!\\r\\nAh, how I am weary of the poets!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but was silent. And\\r\\nZarathustra also was silent; and his eye directed itself inwardly, as if\\r\\nit gazed into the far distance. At last he sighed and drew breath.--\\r\\n\\r\\nI am of to-day and heretofore, said he thereupon; but something is in me\\r\\nthat is of the morrow, and the day following, and the hereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: superficial are\\r\\nthey all unto me, and shallow seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their feeling\\r\\ndid not reach to the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium: these\\r\\nhave as yet been their best contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the\\r\\njingle-jangling of their harps; what have they known hitherto of the\\r\\nfervour of tones!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their water that\\r\\nit may seem deep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but mediaries\\r\\nand mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, and impure!--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, I cast indeed my net into their sea, and meant to catch good fish;\\r\\nbut always did I draw up the head of some ancient God.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they themselves may\\r\\nwell originate from the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, one findeth pearls in them: thereby they are the more like\\r\\nhard molluscs. And instead of a soul, I have often found in them salt\\r\\nslime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the sea the\\r\\npeacock of peacocks?\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out its tail;\\r\\nnever doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the sand with its\\r\\nsoul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, to the swamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This parable I speak\\r\\nunto the poets.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a sea of\\r\\nvanity!\\r\\n\\r\\nSpectators, seeketh the spirit of the poet--should they even be\\r\\nbuffaloes!--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming when it\\r\\nwill become weary of itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned towards\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nPenitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out of the\\r\\npoets.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXL. GREAT EVENTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an isle in the sea--not far from the Happy Isles of\\r\\nZarathustra--on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle the people,\\r\\nand especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a\\r\\nrock before the gate of the nether-world; but that through the volcano\\r\\nitself the narrow way leadeth downwards which conducteth to this gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Happy Isles, it\\r\\nhappened that a ship anchored at the isle on which standeth the smoking\\r\\nmountain, and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide\\r\\nhour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they\\r\\nsaw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said\\r\\ndistinctly: \"It is time! It is the highest time!\" But when the figure\\r\\nwas nearest to them (it flew past quickly, however, like a shadow, in\\r\\nthe direction of the volcano), then did they recognise with the greatest\\r\\nsurprise that it was Zarathustra; for they had all seen him before\\r\\nexcept the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: in\\r\\nsuch wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Behold!\" said the old helmsman, \"there goeth Zarathustra to hell!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the same time that these sailors landed on the fire-isle, there\\r\\nwas a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were\\r\\nasked about it, they said that he had gone on board a ship by night,\\r\\nwithout saying whither he was going.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, however, there came\\r\\nthe story of the ship\\'s crew in addition to this uneasiness--and\\r\\nthen did all the people say that the devil had taken Zarathustra. His\\r\\ndisciples laughed, sure enough, at this talk; and one of them said even:\\r\\n\"Sooner would I believe that Zarathustra hath taken the devil.\" But at\\r\\nthe bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so\\r\\ntheir joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is the account of Zarathustra\\'s interview with the fire-dog:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. One of\\r\\nthese diseases, for example, is called \"man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd another of these diseases is called \"the fire-dog\": concerning HIM\\r\\nmen have greatly deceived themselves, and let themselves be deceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fathom this mystery did I go o\\'er the sea; and I have seen the truth\\r\\nnaked, verily! barefooted up to the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and likewise concerning\\r\\nall the spouting and subversive devils, of which not only old women are\\r\\nafraid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!\" cried I, \"and confess how\\r\\ndeep that depth is! Whence cometh that which thou snortest up?\\r\\n\\r\\nThou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embittered eloquence\\r\\nbetray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou takest thy nourishment\\r\\ntoo much from the surface!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: and ever,\\r\\nwhen I have heard subversive and spouting devils speak, I have found\\r\\nthem like thee: embittered, mendacious, and shallow.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are the best\\r\\nbraggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is\\r\\nspongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Freedom\\' ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief in\\r\\n\\'great events,\\' when there is much roaring and smoke about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events--are not our\\r\\nnoisiest, but our stillest hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new\\r\\nvalues, doth the world revolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy noise and smoke\\r\\npassed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay in the\\r\\nmud!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this do I say also to the o\\'erthrowers of statues: It is certainly\\r\\nthe greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues into the mud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its law, that\\r\\nout of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its suffering; and\\r\\nverily! it will yet thank you for o\\'erthrowing it, ye subverters!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, and to all\\r\\nthat is weak with age or virtue--let yourselves be o\\'erthrown! That ye\\r\\nmay again come to life, and that virtue--may come to you!--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me sullenly, and\\r\\nasked: \"Church? What is that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Church?\" answered I, \"that is a kind of state, and indeed the most\\r\\nmendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! Thou surely knowest\\r\\nthine own species best!\\r\\n\\r\\nLike thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like thee doth it like\\r\\nto speak with smoke and roaring--to make believe, like thee, that it\\r\\nspeaketh out of the heart of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it seeketh by all means to be the most important creature on earth,\\r\\nthe state; and people think it so.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. \"What!\"\\r\\ncried he, \"the most important creature on earth? And people think it\\r\\nso?\" And so much vapour and terrible voices came out of his throat, that\\r\\nI thought he would choke with vexation and envy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, however, as\\r\\nhe was quiet, I said laughingly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of another\\r\\nfire-dog; he speaketh actually out of the heart of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his heart desire.\\r\\nWhat are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him!\\r\\n\\r\\nLaughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is he to thy\\r\\ngargling and spewing and grips in the bowels!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gold, however, and the laughter--these doth he take out of the heart\\r\\nof the earth: for, that thou mayst know it,--THE HEART OF THE EARTH IS\\r\\nOF GOLD.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to listen to me.\\r\\nAbashed did he draw in his tail, said \"bow-wow!\" in a cowed voice, and\\r\\ncrept down into his cave.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly listened to him:\\r\\nso great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits,\\r\\nand the flying man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What am I to think of it!\" said Zarathustra. \"Am I indeed a ghost?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it may have been my shadow. Ye have surely heard something of the\\r\\nWanderer and his Shadow?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold of it;\\r\\notherwise it will spoil my reputation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. \"What am I to\\r\\nthink of it!\" said he once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why did the ghost cry: \\'It is time! It is the highest time!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nFor WHAT is it then--the highest time?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLI. THE SOOTHSAYER.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"-And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of\\r\\ntheir works.\\r\\n\\r\\nA doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: \\'All is empty, all is alike,\\r\\nall hath been!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd from all hills there re-echoed: \\'All is empty, all is alike, all\\r\\nhath been!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten\\r\\nand brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the evil eye\\r\\nhath singed yellow our fields and hearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nArid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn dust\\r\\nlike ashes:--yea, the fire itself have we made aweary.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. All the\\r\\nground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?\\' so\\r\\nsoundeth our plaint--across shallow swamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake\\r\\nand live on--in sepulchres.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding touched\\r\\nhis heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully did he go about and wearily;\\r\\nand he became like unto those of whom the soothsayer had spoken.--\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there cometh the\\r\\nlong twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter worlds shall\\r\\nit be a light, and also to remotest nights!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for three days\\r\\nhe did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, and lost his speech.\\r\\nAt last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. His disciples,\\r\\nhowever, sat around him in long night-watches, and waited anxiously to\\r\\nsee if he would awake, and speak again, and recover from his affliction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he awoke; his\\r\\nvoice, however, came unto his disciples as from afar:\\r\\n\\r\\nHear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me to\\r\\ndivine its meaning!\\r\\n\\r\\nA riddle is it still unto me, this dream; the meaning is hidden in it\\r\\nand encaged, and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman and\\r\\ngrave-guardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain-fortress of\\r\\nDeath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere did I guard his coffins: full stood the musty vaults of those\\r\\ntrophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry and\\r\\ndust-covered lay my soul. And who could have aired his soul there!\\r\\n\\r\\nBrightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness cowered beside\\r\\nher; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the worst of my female\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeys did I carry, the rustiest of all keys; and I knew how to open with\\r\\nthem the most creaking of all gates.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long corridors\\r\\nwhen the leaves of the gate opened: ungraciously did this bird cry,\\r\\nunwillingly was it awakened.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, when it again\\r\\nbecame silent and still all around, and I alone sat in that malignant\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still was: what\\r\\ndo I know thereof! But at last there happened that which awoke me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice did the\\r\\nvaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlpa! cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! who\\r\\ncarrieth his ashes unto the mountain?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I pressed the key, and pulled at the gate, and exerted myself. But\\r\\nnot a finger\\'s-breadth was it yet open:\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, whizzing, and\\r\\npiercing, it threw unto me a black coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in the roaring, and whistling, and whizzing the coffin burst up, and\\r\\nspouted out a thousand peals of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and\\r\\nchild-sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I cried with\\r\\nhorror as I ne\\'er cried before.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut mine own crying awoke me:--and I came to myself.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent: for as yet\\r\\nhe knew not the interpretation thereof. But the disciple whom he loved\\r\\nmost arose quickly, seized Zarathustra\\'s hand, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy life itself interpreteth unto us this dream, O Zarathustra!\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which bursteth open\\r\\nthe gates of the fortress of Death?\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and\\r\\nangel-caricatures of life?\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, like a thousand peals of children\\'s laughter cometh\\r\\nZarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watchmen and\\r\\ngrave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinister keys.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: fainting and\\r\\nrecovering will demonstrate thy power over them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weariness, even then\\r\\nwilt thou not disappear from our firmament, thou advocate of life!\\r\\n\\r\\nNew stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories: verily,\\r\\nlaughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many-hued canopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow will children\\'s laughter ever from coffins flow; now will a strong\\r\\nwind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weariness: of this thou art\\r\\nthyself the pledge and the prophet!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, THEY THEMSELVES DIDST THOU DREAM, thine enemies: that was thy\\r\\nsorest dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as thou awokest from them and camest to thyself, so shall they\\r\\nawaken from themselves--and come unto thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the disciple; and all the others then thronged around\\r\\nZarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to persuade him to\\r\\nleave his bed and his sadness, and return unto them. Zarathustra,\\r\\nhowever, sat upright on his couch, with an absent look. Like one\\r\\nreturning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples, and\\r\\nexamined their features; but still he knew them not. When, however, they\\r\\nraised him, and set him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye\\r\\nchanged; he understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard,\\r\\nand said with a strong voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! this hath just its time; but see to it, my disciples, that we\\r\\nhave a good repast; and without delay! Thus do I mean to make amends for\\r\\nbad dreams!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soothsayer, however, shall eat and drink at my side: and verily, I\\r\\nwill yet show him a sea in which he can drown himself!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. Then did he gaze long into the face of the\\r\\ndisciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and shook his head.--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLII. REDEMPTION.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then did the\\r\\ncripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback spake thus unto him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from thee, and acquire faith\\r\\nin thy teaching: but for them to believe fully in thee, one thing is\\r\\nstill needful--thou must first of all convince us cripples! Here hast\\r\\nthou now a fine selection, and verily, an opportunity with more than one\\r\\nforelock! The blind canst thou heal, and make the lame run; and from\\r\\nhim who hath too much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a\\r\\nlittle;--that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples\\r\\nbelieve in Zarathustra!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so spake: When one\\r\\ntaketh his hump from the hunchback, then doth one take from him his\\r\\nspirit--so do the people teach. And when one giveth the blind man eyes,\\r\\nthen doth he see too many bad things on the earth: so that he curseth\\r\\nhim who healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, inflicteth\\r\\nupon him the greatest injury; for hardly can he run, when his vices\\r\\nrun away with him--so do the people teach concerning cripples. And why\\r\\nshould not Zarathustra also learn from the people, when the people learn\\r\\nfrom Zarathustra?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, however, the smallest thing unto me since I have been amongst\\r\\nmen, to see one person lacking an eye, another an ear, and a third a\\r\\nleg, and that others have lost the tongue, or the nose, or the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see and have seen worse things, and divers things so hideous, that I\\r\\nshould neither like to speak of all matters, nor even keep silent about\\r\\nsome of them: namely, men who lack everything, except that they have\\r\\ntoo much of one thing--men who are nothing more than a big eye, or a big\\r\\nmouth, or a big belly, or something else big,--reversed cripples, I call\\r\\nsuch men.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time passed over\\r\\nthis bridge, then I could not trust mine eyes, but looked again and\\r\\nagain, and said at last: \"That is an ear! An ear as big as a man!\" I\\r\\nlooked still more attentively--and actually there did move under the ear\\r\\nsomething that was pitiably small and poor and slim. And in truth this\\r\\nimmense ear was perched on a small thin stalk--the stalk, however, was a\\r\\nman! A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise further\\r\\na small envious countenance, and also that a bloated soullet dangled at\\r\\nthe stalk. The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a\\r\\nman, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when\\r\\nthey spake of great men--and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed\\r\\ncripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and unto those of\\r\\nwhom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate, then did he turn to\\r\\nhis disciples in profound dejection, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and\\r\\nlimbs of human beings!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man broken up, and\\r\\nscattered about, as on a battle- and butcher-ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it findeth ever\\r\\nthe same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances--but no men!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present and the bygone upon earth--ah! my friends--that is MY most\\r\\nunbearable trouble; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a\\r\\nseer of what is to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nA seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to the\\r\\nfuture--and alas! also as it were a cripple on this bridge: all that is\\r\\nZarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ye also asked yourselves often: \"Who is Zarathustra to us? What\\r\\nshall he be called by us?\" And like me, did ye give yourselves questions\\r\\nfor answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? A\\r\\nharvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a healed one?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a subjugator? A good\\r\\none? Or an evil one?\\r\\n\\r\\nI walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that future which I\\r\\ncontemplate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into\\r\\nunity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how could I endure to be a man, if man were not also the composer,\\r\\nand riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo redeem what is past, and to transform every \"It was\" into \"Thus would\\r\\nI have it!\"--that only do I call redemption!\\r\\n\\r\\nWill--so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus have I taught\\r\\nyou, my friends! But now learn this likewise: the Will itself is still a\\r\\nprisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilling emancipateth: but what is that called which still putteth the\\r\\nemancipator in chains?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It was\": thus is the Will\\'s teeth-gnashing and lonesomest tribulation\\r\\ncalled. Impotent towards what hath been done--it is a malicious\\r\\nspectator of all that is past.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot backward can the Will will; that it cannot break time and time\\'s\\r\\ndesire--that is the Will\\'s lonesomest tribulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWilling emancipateth: what doth Willing itself devise in order to get\\r\\nfree from its tribulation and mock at its prison?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, a fool becometh every prisoner! Foolishly delivereth itself also the\\r\\nimprisoned Will.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat time doth not run backward--that is its animosity: \"That which\\r\\nwas\": so is the stone which it cannot roll called.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and ill-humour, and taketh\\r\\nrevenge on whatever doth not, like it, feel rage and ill-humour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did the Will, the emancipator, become a torturer; and on all\\r\\nthat is capable of suffering it taketh revenge, because it cannot go\\r\\nbackward.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, yea, this alone is REVENGE itself: the Will\\'s antipathy to time,\\r\\nand its \"It was.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, a great folly dwelleth in our Will; and it became a curse unto\\r\\nall humanity, that this folly acquired spirit!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SPIRIT OF REVENGE: my friends, that hath hitherto been man\\'s best\\r\\ncontemplation; and where there was suffering, it was claimed there was\\r\\nalways penalty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Penalty,\" so calleth itself revenge. With a lying word it feigneth a\\r\\ngood conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd because in the willer himself there is suffering, because he cannot\\r\\nwill backwards--thus was Willing itself, and all life, claimed--to be\\r\\npenalty!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit, until at last\\r\\nmadness preached: \"Everything perisheth, therefore everything deserveth\\r\\nto perish!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And this itself is justice, the law of time--that he must devour his\\r\\nchildren:\" thus did madness preach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morally are things ordered according to justice and penalty. Oh, where\\r\\nis there deliverance from the flux of things and from the \\'existence\\' of\\r\\npenalty?\" Thus did madness preach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice? Alas,\\r\\nunrollable is the stone, \\'It was\\': eternal must also be all penalties!\"\\r\\nThus did madness preach.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No deed can be annihilated: how could it be undone by the penalty!\\r\\nThis, this is what is eternal in the \\'existence\\' of penalty, that\\r\\nexistence also must be eternally recurring deed and guilt!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless the Will should at last deliver itself, and Willing become\\r\\nnon-Willing--:\" but ye know, my brethren, this fabulous song of madness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from those fabulous songs did I lead you when I taught you: \"The\\r\\nWill is a creator.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll \"It was\" is a fragment, a riddle, a fearful chance--until the\\r\\ncreating Will saith thereto: \"But thus would I have it.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the creating Will saith thereto: \"But thus do I will it! Thus\\r\\nshall I will it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut did it ever speak thus? And when doth this take place? Hath the Will\\r\\nbeen unharnessed from its own folly?\\r\\n\\r\\nHath the Will become its own deliverer and joy-bringer? Hath it\\r\\nunlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth-gnashing?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd who hath taught it reconciliation with time, and something higher\\r\\nthan all reconciliation?\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething higher than all reconciliation must the Will will which is the\\r\\nWill to Power--: but how doth that take place? Who hath taught it also\\r\\nto will backwards?\\r\\n\\r\\n--But at this point in his discourse it chanced that Zarathustra\\r\\nsuddenly paused, and looked like a person in the greatest alarm. With\\r\\nterror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples; his glances pierced as\\r\\nwith arrows their thoughts and arrear-thoughts. But after a brief space\\r\\nhe again laughed, and said soothedly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is difficult to live amongst men, because silence is so difficult--\\r\\nespecially for a babbler.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. The hunchback, however, had listened to the\\r\\nconversation and had covered his face during the time; but when he heard\\r\\nZarathustra laugh, he looked up with curiosity, and said slowly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than unto his\\r\\ndisciples?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra answered: \"What is there to be wondered at! With hunchbacks\\r\\none may well speak in a hunchbacked way!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good,\" said the hunchback; \"and with pupils one may well tell\\r\\ntales out of school.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils--than unto\\r\\nhimself?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIII. MANLY PRUDENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the height, it is the declivity that is terrible!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe declivity, where the gaze shooteth DOWNWARDS, and the hand graspeth\\r\\nUPWARDS. There doth the heart become giddy through its double will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, friends, do ye divine also my heart\\'s double will?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, this is MY declivity and my danger, that my gaze shooteth towards\\r\\nthe summit, and my hand would fain clutch and lean--on the depth!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo man clingeth my will; with chains do I bind myself to man, because\\r\\nI am pulled upwards to the Superman: for thither doth mine other will\\r\\ntend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd THEREFORE do I live blindly among men, as if I knew them not: that\\r\\nmy hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often spread around\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask: Who wisheth to deceive\\r\\nme?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be deceived, so\\r\\nas not to be on my guard against deceivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be an anchor to my\\r\\nball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and away!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis providence is over my fate, that I have to be without foresight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who would not languish amongst men, must learn to drink out of\\r\\nall glasses; and he who would keep clean amongst men, must know how to\\r\\nwash himself even with dirty water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus spake I often to myself for consolation: \"Courage! Cheer up!\\r\\nold heart! An unhappiness hath failed to befall thee: enjoy that as\\r\\nthy--happiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, however, is mine other manly prudence: I am more forbearing to the\\r\\nVAIN than to the proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, however, pride\\r\\nis wounded, there there groweth up something better than pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat life may be fair to behold, its game must be well played; for that\\r\\npurpose, however, it needeth good actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood actors have I found all the vain ones: they play, and wish people\\r\\nto be fond of beholding them--all their spirit is in this wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their\\r\\nneighbourhood I like to look upon life--it cureth of melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the physicians\\r\\nof my melancholy, and keep me attached to man as to a drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd further, who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty of the vain\\r\\nman! I am favourable to him, and sympathetic on account of his modesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom you would he learn his belief in himself; he feedeth upon your\\r\\nglances, he eateth praise out of your hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour lies doth he even believe when you lie favourably about him: for in\\r\\nits depths sigheth his heart: \"What am _I_?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself--well, the\\r\\nvain man is unconscious of his modesty!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is, however, my third manly prudence: I am not put out of conceit\\r\\nwith the WICKED by your timorousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth: tigers and palms\\r\\nand rattle-snakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm sun, and much\\r\\nthat is marvellous in the wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so found I\\r\\nalso human wickedness below the fame of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd oft did I ask with a shake of the head: Why still rattle, ye\\r\\nrattle-snakes?\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, there is still a future even for evil! And the warmest south is\\r\\nstill undiscovered by man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many things are now called the worst wickedness, which are only\\r\\ntwelve feet broad and three months long! Some day, however, will greater\\r\\ndragons come into the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the superdragon that\\r\\nis worthy of him, there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin\\r\\nforests!\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of your\\r\\npoison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a good hunt!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be laughed at, and\\r\\nespecially your fear of what hath hitherto been called \"the devil!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the Superman\\r\\nwould be FRIGHTFUL in his goodness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar-glow of the\\r\\nwisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his nakedness!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe highest men who have come within my ken! this is my doubt of you, and\\r\\nmy secret laughter: I suspect ye would call my Superman--a devil!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from their \"height\"\\r\\ndid I long to be up, out, and away to the Superman!\\r\\n\\r\\nA horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked: then there grew\\r\\nfor me the pinions to soar away into distant futures.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto more distant futures, into more southern souths than ever artist\\r\\ndreamed of: thither, where Gods are ashamed of all clothes!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut disguised do I want to see YOU, ye neighbours and fellowmen, and\\r\\nwell-attired and vain and estimable, as \"the good and just;\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd disguised will I myself sit amongst you--that I may MISTAKE you and\\r\\nmyself: for that is my last manly prudence.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIV. THE STILLEST HOUR.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me troubled, driven\\r\\nforth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go--alas, to go away from YOU!\\r\\n\\r\\nYea, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but unjoyously\\r\\nthis time doth the bear go back to his cave!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hath happened unto me? Who ordereth this?--Ah, mine angry mistress\\r\\nwisheth it so; she spake unto me. Have I ever named her name to you?\\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday towards evening there spake unto me MY STILLEST HOUR: that is\\r\\nthe name of my terrible mistress.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus did it happen--for everything must I tell you, that your heart\\r\\nmay not harden against the suddenly departing one!\\r\\n\\r\\nDo ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep?--\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the very toes he is terrified, because the ground giveth way under\\r\\nhim, and the dream beginneth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis do I speak unto you in parable. Yesterday at the stillest hour did\\r\\nthe ground give way under me: the dream began.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour-hand moved on, the timepiece of my life drew breath--never did\\r\\nI hear such stillness around me, so that my heart was terrified.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there spoken unto me without voice: \"THOU KNOWEST IT,\\r\\nZARATHUSTRA?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I cried in terror at this whispering, and the blood left my face:\\r\\nbut I was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there once more spoken unto me without voice: \"Thou knowest it,\\r\\nZarathustra, but thou dost not speak it!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd at last I answered, like one defiant: \"Yea, I know it, but I will\\r\\nnot speak it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"Thou WILT not,\\r\\nZarathustra? Is this true? Conceal thyself not behind thy defiance!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I wept and trembled like a child, and said: \"Ah, I would indeed, but\\r\\nhow can I do it! Exempt me only from this! It is beyond my power!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"What matter about\\r\\nthyself, Zarathustra! Speak thy word, and succumb!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"Ah, is it MY word? Who am _I_? I await the worthier\\r\\none; I am not worthy even to succumb by it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"What matter about\\r\\nthyself? Thou art not yet humble enough for me. Humility hath the\\r\\nhardest skin.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"What hath not the skin of my humility endured! At the\\r\\nfoot of my height do I dwell: how high are my summits, no one hath yet\\r\\ntold me. But well do I know my valleys.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"O Zarathustra, he\\r\\nwho hath to remove mountains removeth also valleys and plains.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"As yet hath my word not removed mountains, and what I\\r\\nhave spoken hath not reached man. I went, indeed, unto men, but not yet\\r\\nhave I attained unto them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"What knowest thou\\r\\nTHEREOF! The dew falleth on the grass when the night is most silent.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"They mocked me when I found and walked in mine own\\r\\npath; and certainly did my feet then tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus did they speak unto me: Thou forgottest the path before, now\\r\\ndost thou also forget how to walk!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"What matter about\\r\\ntheir mockery! Thou art one who hast unlearned to obey: now shalt thou\\r\\ncommand!\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowest thou not who is most needed by all? He who commandeth great\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo execute great things is difficult: but the more difficult task is to\\r\\ncommand great things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is thy most unpardonable obstinacy: thou hast the power, and thou\\r\\nwilt not rule.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"I lack the lion\\'s voice for all commanding.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me as a whispering: \"It is the stillest\\r\\nwords which bring the storm. Thoughts that come with doves\\' footsteps\\r\\nguide the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, thou shalt go as a shadow of that which is to come: thus\\r\\nwilt thou command, and in commanding go foremost.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I answered: \"I am ashamed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was there again spoken unto me without voice: \"Thou must yet become\\r\\na child, and be without shame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pride of youth is still upon thee; late hast thou become young: but\\r\\nhe who would become a child must surmount even his youth.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, however, did I say\\r\\nwhat I had said at first. \"I will not.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how that laughing\\r\\nlacerated my bowels and cut into my heart!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there was spoken unto me for the last time: \"O Zarathustra, thy\\r\\nfruits are ripe, but thou art not ripe for thy fruits!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo must thou go again into solitude: for thou shalt yet become\\r\\nmellow.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd again was there a laughing, and it fled: then did it become still\\r\\naround me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, on the ground,\\r\\nand the sweat flowed from my limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Now have ye heard all, and why I have to return into my solitude.\\r\\nNothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even this have ye heard from me, WHO is still the most reserved of\\r\\nmen--and will be so!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, my friends! I should have something more to say unto you! I should\\r\\nhave something more to give unto you! Why do I not give it? Am I then a\\r\\nniggard?--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the violence of his\\r\\npain, and a sense of the nearness of his departure from his friends came\\r\\nover him, so that he wept aloud; and no one knew how to console him. In\\r\\nthe night, however, he went away alone and left his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIRD PART.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward because\\r\\nI am exalted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays\\r\\nand tragic realities.\"--ZARATHUSTRA, I., \"Reading and Writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLV. THE WANDERER.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the\\r\\nridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the\\r\\nother coast; because there he meant to embark. For there was a good\\r\\nroadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those\\r\\nships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the\\r\\nHappy Isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought\\r\\non the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how\\r\\nmany mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a wanderer and mountain-climber, said he to his heart, I love not\\r\\nthe plains, and it seemeth I cannot long sit still.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience--a wandering\\r\\nwill be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in the end one experienceth\\r\\nonly oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time is now past when accidents could befall me; and what COULD now\\r\\nfall to my lot which would not already be mine own!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt returneth only, it cometh home to me at last--mine own Self, and\\r\\nsuch of it as hath been long abroad, and scattered among things and\\r\\naccidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one thing more do I know: I stand now before my last summit, and\\r\\nbefore that which hath been longest reserved for me. Ah, my hardest path\\r\\nmust I ascend! Ah, I have begun my lonesomest wandering!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, who is of my nature doth not avoid such an hour: the hour\\r\\nthat saith unto him: Now only dost thou go the way to thy greatness!\\r\\nSummit and abyss--these are now comprised together!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou goest the way to thy greatness: now hath it become thy last refuge,\\r\\nwhat was hitherto thy last danger!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou goest the way to thy greatness: it must now be thy best courage\\r\\nthat there is no longer any path behind thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou goest the way to thy greatness: here shall no one steal after thee!\\r\\nThy foot itself hath effaced the path behind thee, and over it standeth\\r\\nwritten: Impossibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if all ladders henceforth fail thee, then must thou learn to mount\\r\\nupon thine own head: how couldst thou mount upward otherwise?\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon thine own head, and beyond thine own heart! Now must the gentlest\\r\\nin thee become the hardest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who hath always much-indulged himself, sickeneth at last by his\\r\\nmuch-indulgence. Praises on what maketh hardy! I do not praise the land\\r\\nwhere butter and honey--flow!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo learn TO LOOK AWAY FROM oneself, is necessary in order to see MANY\\r\\nTHINGS:--this hardiness is needed by every mountain-climber.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner, how can he\\r\\never see more of anything than its foreground!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou, O Zarathustra, wouldst view the ground of everything, and its\\r\\nbackground: thus must thou mount even above thyself--up, upwards, until\\r\\nthou hast even thy stars UNDER thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nYea! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: that only would I\\r\\ncall my SUMMIT, that hath remained for me as my LAST summit!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his heart\\r\\nwith harsh maxims: for he was sore at heart as he had never been before.\\r\\nAnd when he had reached the top of the mountain-ridge, behold, there\\r\\nlay the other sea spread out before him: and he stood still and was\\r\\nlong silent. The night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and\\r\\nstarry.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am ready. Now\\r\\nhath my last lonesomeness begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, this sombre, sad sea, below me! Ah, this sombre nocturnal vexation!\\r\\nAh, fate and sea! To you must I now GO DOWN!\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore my highest mountain do I stand, and before my longest wandering:\\r\\ntherefore must I first go deeper down than I ever ascended:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its darkest\\r\\nflood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I learn\\r\\nthat they come out of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their\\r\\nsummits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold:\\r\\nwhen, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood\\r\\nalone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and\\r\\neagerer than ever before.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything as yet sleepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. Drowsily and\\r\\nstrangely doth its eye gaze upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it breatheth warmly--I feel it. And I feel also that it dreameth. It\\r\\ntosseth about dreamily on hard pillows.\\r\\n\\r\\nHark! Hark! How it groaneth with evil recollections! Or evil\\r\\nexpectations?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, I am sad along with thee, thou dusky monster, and angry with myself\\r\\neven for thy sake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, would I free\\r\\nthee from evil dreams!--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while Zarathustra thus spake, he laughed at himself with melancholy\\r\\nand bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, wilt thou even sing\\r\\nconsolation to the sea?\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, thou amiable fool, Zarathustra, thou too-blindly confiding one! But\\r\\nthus hast thou ever been: ever hast thou approached confidently all that\\r\\nis terrible.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery monster wouldst thou caress. A whiff of warm breath, a little soft\\r\\ntuft on its paw--: and immediately wert thou ready to love and lure it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOVE is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything, IF IT ONLY\\r\\nLIVE! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in love!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. Then,\\r\\nhowever, he thought of his abandoned friends--and as if he had done them\\r\\na wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided himself because of his thoughts.\\r\\nAnd forthwith it came to pass that the laugher wept--with anger and\\r\\nlonging wept Zarathustra bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVI. THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was on board the\\r\\nship--for a man who came from the Happy Isles had gone on board along\\r\\nwith him,--there was great curiosity and expectation. But Zarathustra\\r\\nkept silent for two days, and was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he\\r\\nneither answered looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day,\\r\\nhowever, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for\\r\\nthere were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the\\r\\nship, which came from afar, and was to go still further. Zarathustra,\\r\\nhowever, was fond of all those who make distant voyages, and dislike to\\r\\nlive without danger. And behold! when listening, his own tongue was\\r\\nat last loosened, and the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to\\r\\nspeak thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever hath embarked\\r\\nwith cunning sails upon frightful seas,--\\r\\n\\r\\nTo you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose souls are\\r\\nallured by flutes to every treacherous gulf:\\r\\n\\r\\n--For ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand; and where ye\\r\\ncan DIVINE, there do ye hate to CALCULATE--\\r\\n\\r\\nTo you only do I tell the enigma that I SAW--the vision of the\\r\\nlonesomest one.--\\r\\n\\r\\nGloomily walked I lately in corpse-coloured twilight--gloomily and\\r\\nsternly, with compressed lips. Not only one sun had set for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nA path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, lonesome path,\\r\\nwhich neither herb nor shrub any longer cheered, a mountain-path,\\r\\ncrunched under the daring of my foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, trampling the\\r\\nstone that let it slip: thus did my foot force its way upwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpwards:--in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, towards the\\r\\nabyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpwards:--although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half-mole; paralysed,\\r\\nparalysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts like drops of lead\\r\\ninto my brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" it whispered scornfully, syllable by syllable, \"thou\\r\\nstone of wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, but every thrown stone\\r\\nmust--fall!\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou\\r\\nstar-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high,--but every thrown\\r\\nstone--must fall!\\r\\n\\r\\nCondemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zarathustra, far\\r\\nindeed threwest thou thy stone--but upon THYSELF will it recoil!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, however,\\r\\noppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily lonesomer than when\\r\\nalone!\\r\\n\\r\\nI ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought,--but everything oppressed\\r\\nme. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse\\r\\ndream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto\\r\\nslain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still\\r\\nand say: \"Dwarf! Thou! Or I!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nFor courage is the best slayer,--courage which ATTACKETH: for in every\\r\\nattack there is sound of triumph.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby hath he overcome\\r\\nevery animal. With sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain; human\\r\\npain, however, is the sorest pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth man not stand\\r\\nat abysses! Is not seeing itself--seeing abysses?\\r\\n\\r\\nCourage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering.\\r\\nFellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man\\r\\nlooketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nCourage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it\\r\\nslayeth even death itself; for it saith: \"WAS THAT life? Well! Once\\r\\nmore!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. He who hath\\r\\nears to hear, let him hear.--\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Halt, dwarf!\" said I. \"Either I--or thou! I, however, am the stronger\\r\\nof the two:--thou knowest not mine abysmal thought! IT--couldst thou not\\r\\nendure!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen happened that which made me lighter: for the dwarf sprang from my\\r\\nshoulder, the prying sprite! And it squatted on a stone in front of me.\\r\\nThere was however a gateway just where we halted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look at this gateway! Dwarf!\" I continued, \"it hath two faces. Two\\r\\nroads come together here: these hath no one yet gone to the end of.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis long lane backwards: it continueth for an eternity. And that long\\r\\nlane forward--that is another eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are antithetical to one another, these roads; they directly abut on\\r\\none another:--and it is here, at this gateway, that they come together.\\r\\nThe name of the gateway is inscribed above: \\'This Moment.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut should one follow them further--and ever further and further\\r\\non, thinkest thou, dwarf, that these roads would be eternally\\r\\nantithetical?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Everything straight lieth,\" murmured the dwarf, contemptuously. \"All\\r\\ntruth is crooked; time itself is a circle.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou spirit of gravity!\" said I wrathfully, \"do not take it too\\r\\nlightly! Or I shall let thee squat where thou squattest, Haltfoot,--and\\r\\nI carried thee HIGH!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Observe,\" continued I, \"This Moment! From the gateway, This Moment,\\r\\nthere runneth a long eternal lane BACKWARDS: behind us lieth an\\r\\neternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust not whatever CAN run its course of all things, have already run\\r\\nalong that lane? Must not whatever CAN happen of all things have already\\r\\nhappened, resulted, and gone by?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if everything have already existed, what thinkest thou, dwarf, of\\r\\nThis Moment? Must not this gateway also--have already existed?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd are not all things closely bound together in such wise that This\\r\\nMoment draweth all coming things after it? CONSEQUENTLY--itself also?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor whatever CAN run its course of all things, also in this long lane\\r\\nOUTWARD--MUST it once more run!--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this slow spider which creepeth in the moonlight, and this moonlight\\r\\nitself, and thou and I in this gateway whispering together, whispering\\r\\nof eternal things--must we not all have already existed?\\r\\n\\r\\n--And must we not return and run in that other lane out before us, that\\r\\nlong weird lane--must we not eternally return?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did I speak, and always more softly: for I was afraid of mine own\\r\\nthoughts, and arrear-thoughts. Then, suddenly did I hear a dog HOWL near\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I ever heard a dog howl thus? My thoughts ran back. Yes! When I was\\r\\na child, in my most distant childhood:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Then did I hear a dog howl thus. And saw it also, with hair bristling,\\r\\nits head upwards, trembling in the stillest midnight, when even dogs\\r\\nbelieve in ghosts:\\r\\n\\r\\n--So that it excited my commiseration. For just then went the full moon,\\r\\nsilent as death, over the house; just then did it stand still, a glowing\\r\\nglobe--at rest on the flat roof, as if on some one\\'s property:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThereby had the dog been terrified: for dogs believe in thieves and\\r\\nghosts. And when I again heard such howling, then did it excite my\\r\\ncommiseration once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere was now the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the\\r\\nwhispering? Had I dreamt? Had I awakened? \\'Twixt rugged rocks did I\\r\\nsuddenly stand alone, dreary in the dreariest moonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBUT THERE LAY A MAN! And there! The dog leaping, bristling, whining--now\\r\\ndid it see me coming--then did it howl again, then did it CRY:--had I\\r\\never heard a dog cry so for help?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, what I saw, the like had I never seen. A young shepherd did\\r\\nI see, writhing, choking, quivering, with distorted countenance, and\\r\\nwith a heavy black serpent hanging out of his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance?\\r\\nHe had perhaps gone to sleep? Then had the serpent crawled into his\\r\\nthroat--there had it bitten itself fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hand pulled at the serpent, and pulled:--in vain! I failed to pull\\r\\nthe serpent out of his throat. Then there cried out of me: \"Bite! Bite!\\r\\n\\r\\nIts head off! Bite!\"--so cried it out of me; my horror, my hatred, my\\r\\nloathing, my pity, all my good and my bad cried with one voice out of\\r\\nme.--\\r\\n\\r\\nYe daring ones around me! Ye venturers and adventurers, and whoever\\r\\nof you have embarked with cunning sails on unexplored seas! Ye\\r\\nenigma-enjoyers!\\r\\n\\r\\nSolve unto me the enigma that I then beheld, interpret unto me the\\r\\nvision of the lonesomest one!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it was a vision and a foresight:--WHAT did I then behold in parable?\\r\\nAnd WHO is it that must come some day?\\r\\n\\r\\nWHO is the shepherd into whose throat the serpent thus crawled? WHO is\\r\\nthe man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus crawl?\\r\\n\\r\\n--The shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished him; he bit with a\\r\\nstrong bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent--: and sprang\\r\\nup.--\\r\\n\\r\\nNo longer shepherd, no longer man--a transfigured being, a\\r\\nlight-surrounded being, that LAUGHED! Never on earth laughed a man as HE\\r\\nlaughed!\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, I heard a laughter which was no human laughter,--and now\\r\\ngnaweth a thirst at me, a longing that is never allayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy longing for that laughter gnaweth at me: oh, how can I still endure\\r\\nto live! And how could I endure to die at present!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVII. INVOLUNTARY BLISS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra sail o\\'er\\r\\nthe sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys from the Happy\\r\\nIsles and from his friends, then had he surmounted all his pain--:\\r\\ntriumphantly and with firm foot did he again accept his fate. And then\\r\\ntalked Zarathustra in this wise to his exulting conscience:\\r\\n\\r\\nAlone am I again, and like to be so, alone with the pure heaven, and the\\r\\nopen sea; and again is the afternoon around me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn an afternoon did I find my friends for the first time; on an\\r\\nafternoon, also, did I find them a second time:--at the hour when all\\r\\nlight becometh stiller.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor whatever happiness is still on its way \\'twixt heaven and earth, now\\r\\nseeketh for lodging a luminous soul: WITH HAPPINESS hath all light now\\r\\nbecome stiller.\\r\\n\\r\\nO afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend to the valley\\r\\nthat it might seek a lodging: then did it find those open hospitable\\r\\nsouls.\\r\\n\\r\\nO afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I might have\\r\\none thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, and this dawn of my\\r\\nhighest hope!\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanions did the creating one once seek, and children of HIS hope: and\\r\\nlo, it turned out that he could not find them, except he himself should\\r\\nfirst create them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus am I in the midst of my work, to my children going, and from\\r\\nthem returning: for the sake of his children must Zarathustra perfect\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor in one\\'s heart one loveth only one\\'s child and one\\'s work; and where\\r\\nthere is great love to oneself, then is it the sign of pregnancy: so\\r\\nhave I found it.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill are my children verdant in their first spring, standing nigh one\\r\\nanother, and shaken in common by the winds, the trees of my garden and\\r\\nof my best soil.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, where such trees stand beside one another, there ARE Happy\\r\\nIsles!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one day will I take them up, and put each by itself alone: that it\\r\\nmay learn lonesomeness and defiance and prudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nGnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it then stand by\\r\\nthe sea, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.\\r\\n\\r\\nYonder where the storms rush down into the sea, and the snout of the\\r\\nmountain drinketh water, shall each on a time have his day and night\\r\\nwatches, for HIS testing and recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognised and tested shall each be, to see if he be of my type and\\r\\nlineage:--if he be master of a long will, silent even when he speaketh,\\r\\nand giving in such wise that he TAKETH in giving:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--So that he may one day become my companion, a fellow-creator and\\r\\nfellow-enjoyer with Zarathustra:--such a one as writeth my will on my\\r\\ntables, for the fuller perfection of all things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for his sake and for those like him, must I perfect MYSELF:\\r\\ntherefore do I now avoid my happiness, and present myself to every\\r\\nmisfortune--for MY final testing and recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, it were time that I went away; and the wanderer\\'s shadow and\\r\\nthe longest tedium and the stillest hour--have all said unto me: \"It is\\r\\nthe highest time!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word blew to me through the keyhole and said \"Come!\" The door sprang\\r\\nsubtlely open unto me, and said \"Go!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I lay enchained to my love for my children: desire spread this\\r\\nsnare for me--the desire for love--that I should become the prey of my\\r\\nchildren, and lose myself in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDesiring--that is now for me to have lost myself. I POSSESS YOU, MY\\r\\nCHILDREN! In this possessing shall everything be assurance and nothing\\r\\ndesire.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut brooding lay the sun of my love upon me, in his own juice stewed\\r\\nZarathustra,--then did shadows and doubts fly past me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor frost and winter I now longed: \"Oh, that frost and winter would\\r\\nagain make me crack and crunch!\" sighed I:--then arose icy mist out of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy past burst its tomb, many pains buried alive woke up--: fully slept\\r\\nhad they merely, concealed in corpse-clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo called everything unto me in signs: \"It is time!\" But I--heard not,\\r\\nuntil at last mine abyss moved, and my thought bit me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, abysmal thought, which art MY thought! When shall I find strength to\\r\\nhear thee burrowing, and no longer tremble?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my very throat throbbeth my heart when I hear thee burrowing! Thy\\r\\nmuteness even is like to strangle me, thou abysmal mute one!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet have I never ventured to call thee UP; it hath been enough that\\r\\nI--have carried thee about with me! As yet have I not been strong\\r\\nenough for my final lion-wantonness and playfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSufficiently formidable unto me hath thy weight ever been: but one day\\r\\nshall I yet find the strength and the lion\\'s voice which will call thee\\r\\nup!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I shall have surmounted myself therein, then will I surmount myself\\r\\nalso in that which is greater; and a VICTORY shall be the seal of my\\r\\nperfection!--\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile do I sail along on uncertain seas; chance flattereth me,\\r\\nsmooth-tongued chance; forward and backward do I gaze--, still see I no\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs yet hath the hour of my final struggle not come to me--or doth it\\r\\ncome to me perhaps just now? Verily, with insidious beauty do sea and\\r\\nlife gaze upon me round about:\\r\\n\\r\\nO afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O haven upon high\\r\\nseas! O peace in uncertainty! How I distrust all of you!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, distrustful am I of your insidious beauty! Like the lover am I,\\r\\nwho distrusteth too sleek smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he pusheth the best-beloved before him--tender even in severity, the\\r\\njealous one--, so do I push this blissful hour before me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway with thee, thou blissful hour! With thee hath there come to me an\\r\\ninvoluntary bliss! Ready for my severest pain do I here stand:--at the\\r\\nwrong time hast thou come!\\r\\n\\r\\nAway with thee, thou blissful hour! Rather harbour there--with my\\r\\nchildren! Hasten! and bless them before eventide with MY happiness!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere, already approacheth eventide: the sun sinketh. Away--my\\r\\nhappiness!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. And he waited for his misfortune the whole\\r\\nnight; but he waited in vain. The night remained clear and calm, and\\r\\nhappiness itself came nigher and nigher unto him. Towards morning,\\r\\nhowever, Zarathustra laughed to his heart, and said mockingly:\\r\\n\"Happiness runneth after me. That is because I do not run after women.\\r\\nHappiness, however, is a woman.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLVIII. BEFORE SUNRISE.\\r\\n\\r\\nO heaven above me, thou pure, thou deep heaven! Thou abyss of light!\\r\\nGazing on thee, I tremble with divine desires.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp to thy height to toss myself--that is MY depth! In thy purity to hide\\r\\nmyself--that is MINE innocence!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe God veileth his beauty: thus hidest thou thy stars. Thou speakest\\r\\nnot: THUS proclaimest thou thy wisdom unto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMute o\\'er the raging sea hast thou risen for me to-day; thy love and thy\\r\\nmodesty make a revelation unto my raging soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that thou camest unto me beautiful, veiled in thy beauty, in that\\r\\nthou spakest unto me mutely, obvious in thy wisdom:\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, how could I fail to divine all the modesty of thy soul! BEFORE the\\r\\nsun didst thou come unto me--the lonesomest one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have been friends from the beginning: to us are grief, gruesomeness,\\r\\nand ground common; even the sun is common to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not speak to each other, because we know too much--: we keep\\r\\nsilent to each other, we smile our knowledge to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou not the light of my fire? Hast thou not the sister-soul of mine\\r\\ninsight?\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether did we learn everything; together did we learn to ascend beyond\\r\\nourselves to ourselves, and to smile uncloudedly:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Uncloudedly to smile down out of luminous eyes and out of miles of\\r\\ndistance, when under us constraint and purpose and guilt steam like\\r\\nrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd wandered I alone, for WHAT did my soul hunger by night and in\\r\\nlabyrinthine paths? And climbed I mountains, WHOM did I ever seek, if\\r\\nnot thee, upon mountains?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all my wandering and mountain-climbing: a necessity was it merely,\\r\\nand a makeshift of the unhandy one:--to FLY only, wanteth mine entire\\r\\nwill, to fly into THEE!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what have I hated more than passing clouds, and whatever tainteth\\r\\nthee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, because it tainted thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passing clouds I detest--those stealthy cats of prey: they take\\r\\nfrom thee and me what is common to us--the vast unbounded Yea- and\\r\\nAmen-saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese mediators and mixers we detest--the passing clouds: those\\r\\nhalf-and-half ones, that have neither learned to bless nor to curse from\\r\\nthe heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather will I sit in a tub under a closed heaven, rather will I sit in\\r\\nthe abyss without heaven, than see thee, thou luminous heaven, tainted\\r\\nwith passing clouds!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd oft have I longed to pin them fast with the jagged gold-wires of\\r\\nlightning, that I might, like the thunder, beat the drum upon their\\r\\nkettle-bellies:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--An angry drummer, because they rob me of thy Yea and Amen!--thou\\r\\nheaven above me, thou pure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of\\r\\nlight!--because they rob thee of MY Yea and Amen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor rather will I have noise and thunders and tempest-blasts, than this\\r\\ndiscreet, doubting cat-repose; and also amongst men do I hate most\\r\\nof all the soft-treaders, and half-and-half ones, and the doubting,\\r\\nhesitating, passing clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd \"he who cannot bless shall LEARN to curse!\"--this clear teaching\\r\\ndropt unto me from the clear heaven; this star standeth in my heaven\\r\\neven in dark nights.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, however, am a blesser and a Yea-sayer, if thou be but around me, thou\\r\\npure, thou luminous heaven! Thou abyss of light!--into all abysses do I\\r\\nthen carry my beneficent Yea-saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nA blesser have I become and a Yea-sayer: and therefore strove I long and\\r\\nwas a striver, that I might one day get my hands free for blessing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, however, is my blessing: to stand above everything as its own\\r\\nheaven, its round roof, its azure bell and eternal security: and blessed\\r\\nis he who thus blesseth!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all things are baptized at the font of eternity, and beyond good and\\r\\nevil; good and evil themselves, however, are but fugitive shadows and\\r\\ndamp afflictions and passing clouds.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, it is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that \"above\\r\\nall things there standeth the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence,\\r\\nthe heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Of Hazard\"--that is the oldest nobility in the world; that gave I back\\r\\nto all things; I emancipated them from bondage under purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis freedom and celestial serenity did I put like an azure bell above\\r\\nall things, when I taught that over them and through them, no \"eternal\\r\\nWill\"--willeth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will, when I taught\\r\\nthat \"In everything there is one thing impossible--rationality!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA LITTLE reason, to be sure, a germ of wisdom scattered from star to\\r\\nstar--this leaven is mixed in all things: for the sake of folly, wisdom\\r\\nis mixed in all things!\\r\\n\\r\\nA little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I\\r\\nfound in all things, that they prefer--to DANCE on the feet of chance.\\r\\n\\r\\nO heaven above me! thou pure, thou lofty heaven! This is now thy purity\\r\\nunto me, that there is no eternal reason-spider and reason-cobweb:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--That thou art to me a dancing-floor for divine chances, that thou art\\r\\nto me a table of the Gods, for divine dice and dice-players!--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou blushest? Have I spoken unspeakable things? Have I abused, when\\r\\nI meant to bless thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is it the shame of being two of us that maketh thee blush!--Dost thou\\r\\nbid me go and be silent, because now--DAY cometh?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is deep:--and deeper than e\\'er the day could read. Not\\r\\neverything may be uttered in presence of day. But day cometh: so let us\\r\\npart!\\r\\n\\r\\nO heaven above me, thou modest one! thou glowing one! O thou, my\\r\\nhappiness before sunrise! The day cometh: so let us part!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nXLIX. THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway\\r\\nto his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and\\r\\nquestionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself\\r\\njestingly: \"Lo, a river that floweth back unto its source in many\\r\\nwindings!\" For he wanted to learn what had taken place AMONG MEN during\\r\\nthe interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when\\r\\nhe saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them up as its\\r\\nsimile!\\r\\n\\r\\nDid perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that\\r\\nanother child put them again into the box!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd these rooms and chambers--can MEN go out and in there? They seem to\\r\\nbe made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others eat\\r\\nwith them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said sorrowfully:\\r\\n\"There hath EVERYTHING become smaller!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverywhere do I see lower doorways: he who is of MY type can still go\\r\\ntherethrough, but--he must stoop!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no longer have\\r\\nto stoop--shall no longer have to stoop BEFORE THE SMALL ONES!\"--And\\r\\nZarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day, however, he gave his discourse on the bedwarfing virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they do not forgive\\r\\nme for not envying their virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey bite at me, because I say unto them that for small people, small\\r\\nvirtues are necessary--and because it is hard for me to understand that\\r\\nsmall people are NECESSARY!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere am I still like a cock in a strange farm-yard, at which even the\\r\\nhens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly to the hens.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoyances; to be\\r\\nprickly towards what is small, seemeth to me wisdom for hedgehogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the\\r\\nevening--they speak of me, but no one thinketh--of me!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the new stillness which I have experienced: their noise around\\r\\nme spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey shout to one another: \"What is this gloomy cloud about to do to us?\\r\\nLet us see that it doth not bring a plague upon us!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd recently did a woman seize upon her child that was coming unto\\r\\nme: \"Take the children away,\" cried she, \"such eyes scorch children\\'s\\r\\nsouls.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThey cough when I speak: they think coughing an objection to strong\\r\\nwinds--they divine nothing of the boisterousness of my happiness!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have not yet time for Zarathustra\"--so they object; but what matter\\r\\nabout a time that \"hath no time\" for Zarathustra?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on\\r\\nTHEIR praise? A girdle of spines is their praise unto me: it scratcheth\\r\\nme even when I take it off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this also did I learn among them: the praiser doeth as if he gave\\r\\nback; in truth, however, he wanteth more to be given him!\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! Verily,\\r\\nto such measure and ticktack, it liketh neither to dance nor to stand\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo small virtues would they fain lure and laud me; to the ticktack of\\r\\nsmall happiness would they fain persuade my foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pass through this people and keep mine eyes open; they have become\\r\\nSMALLER, and ever become smaller:--THE REASON THEREOF IS THEIR DOCTRINE\\r\\nOF HAPPINESS AND VIRTUE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor they are moderate also in virtue,--because they want comfort. With\\r\\ncomfort, however, moderate virtue only is compatible.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride\\r\\nforward: that, I call their HOBBLING.--Thereby they become a hindrance\\r\\nto all who are in haste.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, with stiffened\\r\\nnecks: those do I like to run up against.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. But there is\\r\\nmuch lying among small people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of them WILL, but most of them are WILLED. Some of them are\\r\\ngenuine, but most of them are bad actors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are actors without knowing it amongst them, and actors without\\r\\nintending it--, the genuine ones are always rare, especially the genuine\\r\\nactors.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf man there is little here: therefore do their women masculinise\\r\\nthemselves. For only he who is man enough, will--SAVE THE WOMAN in\\r\\nwoman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even those who\\r\\ncommand feign the virtues of those who serve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I serve, thou servest, we serve\"--so chanteth here even the hypocrisy\\r\\nof the rulers--and alas! if the first lord be ONLY the first servant!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes\\' curiosity alight; and well\\r\\ndid I divine all their fly-happiness, and their buzzing around sunny\\r\\nwindow-panes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much justice and pity,\\r\\nso much weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as grains of sand\\r\\nare round, fair, and considerate to grains of sand.\\r\\n\\r\\nModestly to embrace a small happiness--that do they call \"submission\"!\\r\\nand at the same time they peer modestly after a new small happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their hearts they want simply one thing most of all: that no one hurt\\r\\nthem. Thus do they anticipate every one\\'s wishes and do well unto every\\r\\none.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat, however, is COWARDICE, though it be called \"virtue.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they chance to speak harshly, those small people, then do _I_\\r\\nhear therein only their hoarseness--every draught of air maketh them\\r\\nhoarse.\\r\\n\\r\\nShrewd indeed are they, their virtues have shrewd fingers. But they lack\\r\\nfists: their fingers do not know how to creep behind fists.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirtue for them is what maketh modest and tame: therewith have they made\\r\\nthe wolf a dog, and man himself man\\'s best domestic animal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We set our chair in the MIDST\"--so saith their smirking unto me--\"and\\r\\nas far from dying gladiators as from satisfied swine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat, however, is--MEDIOCRITY, though it be called moderation.--\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pass through this people and let fall many words: but they know\\r\\nneither how to take nor how to retain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wonder why I came not to revile venery and vice; and verily, I came\\r\\nnot to warn against pickpockets either!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey wonder why I am not ready to abet and whet their wisdom: as if they\\r\\nhad not yet enough of wiseacres, whose voices grate on mine ear like\\r\\nslate-pencils!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I call out: \"Curse all the cowardly devils in you, that\\r\\nwould fain whimper and fold the hands and adore\"--then do they shout:\\r\\n\"Zarathustra is godless.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd especially do their teachers of submission shout this;--but\\r\\nprecisely in their ears do I love to cry: \"Yea! I AM Zarathustra, the\\r\\ngodless!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThose teachers of submission! Wherever there is aught puny, or sickly,\\r\\nor scabby, there do they creep like lice; and only my disgust preventeth\\r\\nme from cracking them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! This is my sermon for THEIR ears: I am Zarathustra the godless,\\r\\nwho saith: \"Who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his teaching?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am Zarathustra the godless: where do I find mine equal? And all\\r\\nthose are mine equals who give unto themselves their Will, and divest\\r\\nthemselves of all submission.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in MY pot. And only\\r\\nwhen it hath been quite cooked do I welcome it as MY food.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, many a chance came imperiously unto me: but still more\\r\\nimperiously did my WILL speak unto it,--then did it lie imploringly upon\\r\\nits knees--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Imploring that it might find home and heart with me, and saying\\r\\nflatteringly: \"See, O Zarathustra, how friend only cometh unto\\r\\nfriend!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why talk I, when no one hath MINE ears! And so will I shout it out\\r\\nunto all the winds:\\r\\n\\r\\nYe ever become smaller, ye small people! Ye crumble away, ye comfortable\\r\\nones! Ye will yet perish--\\r\\n\\r\\n--By your many small virtues, by your many small omissions, and by your\\r\\nmany small submissions!\\r\\n\\r\\nToo tender, too yielding: so is your soil! But for a tree to become\\r\\nGREAT, it seeketh to twine hard roots around hard rocks!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso what ye omit weaveth at the web of all the human future; even your\\r\\nnaught is a cobweb, and a spider that liveth on the blood of the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when ye take, then is it like stealing, ye small virtuous ones;\\r\\nbut even among knaves HONOUR saith that \"one shall only steal when one\\r\\ncannot rob.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It giveth itself\"--that is also a doctrine of submission. But I say\\r\\nunto you, ye comfortable ones, that IT TAKETH TO ITSELF, and will ever\\r\\ntake more and more from you!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, that ye would renounce all HALF-willing, and would decide for\\r\\nidleness as ye decide for action!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, that ye understood my word: \"Do ever what ye will--but first be such\\r\\nas CAN WILL.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove ever your neighbour as yourselves--but first be such as LOVE\\r\\nTHEMSELVES--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!\" Thus\\r\\nspeaketh Zarathustra the godless.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why talk I, when no one hath MINE ears! It is still an hour too\\r\\nearly for me here.\\r\\n\\r\\nMine own forerunner am I among this people, mine own cockcrow in dark\\r\\nlanes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut THEIR hour cometh! And there cometh also mine! Hourly do they become\\r\\nsmaller, poorer, unfruitfuller,--poor herbs! poor earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd SOON shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie, and\\r\\nverily, weary of themselves--and panting for FIRE, more than for water!\\r\\n\\r\\nO blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide!--Running\\r\\nfires will I one day make of them, and heralds with flaming tongues:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It cometh, it is nigh,\\r\\nTHE GREAT NOONTIDE!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL. ON THE OLIVE-MOUNT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter, a bad guest, sitteth with me at home; blue are my hands with his\\r\\nfriendly hand-shaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI honour him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do I\\r\\nrun away from him; and when one runneth WELL, then one escapeth him!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the wind is calm--to the\\r\\nsunny corner of mine olive-mount.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of him; because he\\r\\ncleareth my house of flies, and quieteth many little noises.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor he suffereth it not if a gnat wanteth to buzz, or even two of them;\\r\\nalso the lanes maketh he lonesome, so that the moonlight is afraid there\\r\\nat night.\\r\\n\\r\\nA hard guest is he,--but I honour him, and do not worship, like the\\r\\ntenderlings, the pot-bellied fire-idol.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter even a little teeth-chattering than idol-adoration!--so willeth\\r\\nmy nature. And especially have I a grudge against all ardent, steaming,\\r\\nsteamy fire-idols.\\r\\n\\r\\nHim whom I love, I love better in winter than in summer; better do I\\r\\nnow mock at mine enemies, and more heartily, when winter sitteth in my\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeartily, verily, even when I CREEP into bed--: there, still laugheth\\r\\nand wantoneth my hidden happiness; even my deceptive dream laugheth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, a--creeper? Never in my life did I creep before the powerful; and if\\r\\never I lied, then did I lie out of love. Therefore am I glad even in my\\r\\nwinter-bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor bed warmeth me more than a rich one, for I am jealous of my\\r\\npoverty. And in winter she is most faithful unto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a wickedness do I begin every day: I mock at the winter with a cold\\r\\nbath: on that account grumbleth my stern house-mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso do I like to tickle him with a wax-taper, that he may finally let\\r\\nthe heavens emerge from ashy-grey twilight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor especially wicked am I in the morning: at the early hour when the\\r\\npail rattleth at the well, and horses neigh warmly in grey lanes:--\\r\\n\\r\\nImpatiently do I then wait, that the clear sky may finally dawn for me,\\r\\nthe snow-bearded winter-sky, the hoary one, the white-head,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The winter-sky, the silent winter-sky, which often stifleth even its\\r\\nsun!\\r\\n\\r\\nDid I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence? Or did it learn it\\r\\nfrom me? Or hath each of us devised it himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all good things the origin is a thousandfold,--all good roguish\\r\\nthings spring into existence for joy: how could they always do so--for\\r\\nonce only!\\r\\n\\r\\nA good roguish thing is also the long silence, and to look, like the\\r\\nwinter-sky, out of a clear, round-eyed countenance:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Like it to stifle one\\'s sun, and one\\'s inflexible solar will: verily,\\r\\nthis art and this winter-roguishness have I learnt WELL!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy best-loved wickedness and art is it, that my silence hath learned not\\r\\nto betray itself by silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nClattering with diction and dice, I outwit the solemn assistants: all\\r\\nthose stern watchers, shall my will and purpose elude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat no one might see down into my depth and into mine ultimate\\r\\nwill--for that purpose did I devise the long clear silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a shrewd one did I find: he veiled his countenance and made his\\r\\nwater muddy, that no one might see therethrough and thereunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut precisely unto him came the shrewder distrusters and nut-crackers:\\r\\nprecisely from him did they fish his best-concealed fish!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the clear, the honest, the transparent--these are for me the wisest\\r\\nsilent ones: in them, so PROFOUND is the depth that even the clearest\\r\\nwater doth not--betray it.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThou snow-bearded, silent, winter-sky, thou round-eyed whitehead above\\r\\nme! Oh, thou heavenly simile of my soul and its wantonness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd MUST I not conceal myself like one who hath swallowed gold--lest my\\r\\nsoul should be ripped up?\\r\\n\\r\\nMUST I not wear stilts, that they may OVERLOOK my long legs--all those\\r\\nenviers and injurers around me?\\r\\n\\r\\nThose dingy, fire-warmed, used-up, green-tinted, ill-natured souls--how\\r\\nCOULD their envy endure my happiness!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus do I show them only the ice and winter of my peaks--and NOT that my\\r\\nmountain windeth all the solar girdles around it!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey hear only the whistling of my winter-storms: and know NOT that I\\r\\nalso travel over warm seas, like longing, heavy, hot south-winds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey commiserate also my accidents and chances:--but MY word saith:\\r\\n\"Suffer the chance to come unto me: innocent is it as a little child!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow COULD they endure my happiness, if I did not put around it\\r\\naccidents, and winter-privations, and bear-skin caps, and enmantling\\r\\nsnowflakes!\\r\\n\\r\\n--If I did not myself commiserate their PITY, the pity of those enviers\\r\\nand injurers!\\r\\n\\r\\n--If I did not myself sigh before them, and chatter with cold, and\\r\\npatiently LET myself be swathed in their pity!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the wise waggish-will and good-will of my soul, that it\\r\\nCONCEALETH NOT its winters and glacial storms; it concealeth not its\\r\\nchilblains either.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo one man, lonesomeness is the flight of the sick one; to another, it\\r\\nis the flight FROM the sick ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet them HEAR me chattering and sighing with winter-cold, all those poor\\r\\nsquinting knaves around me! With such sighing and chattering do I flee\\r\\nfrom their heated rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet them sympathise with me and sigh with me on account of my\\r\\nchilblains: \"At the ice of knowledge will he yet FREEZE TO DEATH!\"--so\\r\\nthey mourn.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile do I run with warm feet hither and thither on mine\\r\\nolive-mount: in the sunny corner of mine olive-mount do I sing, and mock\\r\\nat all pity.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLI. ON PASSING-BY.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus slowly wandering through many peoples and divers cities, did\\r\\nZarathustra return by round-about roads to his mountains and his cave.\\r\\nAnd behold, thereby came he unawares also to the gate of the GREAT CITY.\\r\\nHere, however, a foaming fool, with extended hands, sprang forward to\\r\\nhim and stood in his way. It was the same fool whom the people called\\r\\n\"the ape of Zarathustra:\" for he had learned from him something of the\\r\\nexpression and modulation of language, and perhaps liked also to borrow\\r\\nfrom the store of his wisdom. And the fool talked thus to Zarathustra:\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, here is the great city: here hast thou nothing to seek\\r\\nand everything to lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy wouldst thou wade through this mire? Have pity upon thy foot! Spit\\r\\nrather on the gate of the city, and--turn back!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the hell for anchorites\\' thoughts: here are great thoughts\\r\\nseethed alive and boiled small.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere do all great sentiments decay: here may only rattle-boned\\r\\nsensations rattle!\\r\\n\\r\\nSmellest thou not already the shambles and cookshops of the spirit?\\r\\nSteameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered spirit?\\r\\n\\r\\nSeest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags?--And they make\\r\\nnewspapers also out of these rags!\\r\\n\\r\\nHearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal game? Loathsome\\r\\nverbal swill doth it vomit forth!--And they make newspapers also out of\\r\\nthis verbal swill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey hound one another, and know not whither! They inflame one another,\\r\\nand know not why! They tinkle with their pinchbeck, they jingle with\\r\\ntheir gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are cold, and seek warmth from distilled waters: they are inflamed,\\r\\nand seek coolness from frozen spirits; they are all sick and sore\\r\\nthrough public opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll lusts and vices are here at home; but here there are also the\\r\\nvirtuous; there is much appointable appointed virtue:--\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch appointable virtue with scribe-fingers, and hardy sitting-flesh and\\r\\nwaiting-flesh, blessed with small breast-stars, and padded, haunchless\\r\\ndaughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is here also much piety, and much faithful spittle-licking and\\r\\nspittle-backing, before the God of Hosts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From on high,\" drippeth the star, and the gracious spittle; for the\\r\\nhigh, longeth every starless bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon hath its court, and the court hath its moon-calves: unto all,\\r\\nhowever, that cometh from the court do the mendicant people pray, and\\r\\nall appointable mendicant virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I serve, thou servest, we serve\"--so prayeth all appointable virtue\\r\\nto the prince: that the merited star may at last stick on the slender\\r\\nbreast!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the moon still revolveth around all that is earthly: so revolveth\\r\\nalso the prince around what is earthliest of all--that, however, is the\\r\\ngold of the shopman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe God of the Hosts of war is not the God of the golden bar; the prince\\r\\nproposeth, but the shopman--disposeth!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy all that is luminous and strong and good in thee, O Zarathustra! Spit\\r\\non this city of shopmen and return back!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere floweth all blood putridly and tepidly and frothily through all\\r\\nveins: spit on the great city, which is the great slum where all the\\r\\nscum frotheth together!\\r\\n\\r\\nSpit on the city of compressed souls and slender breasts, of pointed\\r\\neyes and sticky fingers--\\r\\n\\r\\n--On the city of the obtrusive, the brazen-faced, the pen-demagogues and\\r\\ntongue-demagogues, the overheated ambitious:--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere everything maimed, ill-famed, lustful, untrustful, over-mellow,\\r\\nsickly-yellow and seditious, festereth pernicious:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Spit on the great city and turn back!--\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, did Zarathustra interrupt the foaming fool, and shut his\\r\\nmouth.--\\r\\n\\r\\nStop this at once! called out Zarathustra, long have thy speech and thy\\r\\nspecies disgusted me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy didst thou live so long by the swamp, that thou thyself hadst to\\r\\nbecome a frog and a toad?\\r\\n\\r\\nFloweth there not a tainted, frothy, swamp-blood in thine own veins,\\r\\nwhen thou hast thus learned to croak and revile?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy wentest thou not into the forest? Or why didst thou not till the\\r\\nground? Is the sea not full of green islands?\\r\\n\\r\\nI despise thy contempt; and when thou warnedst me--why didst thou not\\r\\nwarn thyself?\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird take wing; but\\r\\nnot out of the swamp!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThey call thee mine ape, thou foaming fool: but I call thee my\\r\\ngrunting-pig,--by thy grunting, thou spoilest even my praise of folly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was it that first made thee grunt? Because no one sufficiently\\r\\nFLATTERED thee:--therefore didst thou seat thyself beside this filth,\\r\\nthat thou mightest have cause for much grunting,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--That thou mightest have cause for much VENGEANCE! For vengeance, thou\\r\\nvain fool, is all thy foaming; I have divined thee well!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thy fools\\'-word injureth ME, even when thou art right! And even if\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s word WERE a hundred times justified, thou wouldst ever--DO\\r\\nwrong with my word!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. Then did he look on the great city and sighed,\\r\\nand was long silent. At last he spake thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nI loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and there--\\r\\nthere is nothing to better, nothing to worsen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoe to this great city!--And I would that I already saw the pillar of\\r\\nfire in which it will be consumed!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide. But this hath\\r\\nits time and its own fate.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThis precept, however, give I unto thee, in parting, thou fool: Where\\r\\none can no longer love, there should one--PASS BY!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and passed by the fool and the great city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLII. THE APOSTATES.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, lieth everything already withered and grey which but lately stood\\r\\ngreen and many-hued on this meadow! And how much honey of hope did I\\r\\ncarry hence into my beehives!\\r\\n\\r\\nThose young hearts have already all become old--and not old even! only\\r\\nweary, ordinary, comfortable:--they declare it: \"We have again become\\r\\npious.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late did I see them run forth at early morn with valorous steps: but\\r\\nthe feet of their knowledge became weary, and now do they malign even\\r\\ntheir morning valour!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer; to them\\r\\nwinked the laughter of my wisdom:--then did they bethink themselves.\\r\\nJust now have I seen them bent down--to creep to the cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and young\\r\\npoets. A little older, a little colder: and already are they mystifiers,\\r\\nand mumblers and mollycoddles.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid perhaps their hearts despond, because lonesomeness had swallowed me\\r\\nlike a whale? Did their ear perhaps hearken yearningly-long for me IN\\r\\nVAIN, and for my trumpet-notes and herald-calls?\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ah! Ever are there but few of those whose hearts have persistent\\r\\ncourage and exuberance; and in such remaineth also the spirit patient.\\r\\nThe rest, however, are COWARDLY.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest: these are always the great majority, the common-place, the\\r\\nsuperfluous, the far-too many--those all are cowardly!--\\r\\n\\r\\nHim who is of my type, will also the experiences of my type meet on the\\r\\nway: so that his first companions must be corpses and buffoons.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis second companions, however--they will call themselves his\\r\\nBELIEVERS,--will be a living host, with much love, much folly, much\\r\\nunbearded veneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those believers shall he who is of my type among men not bind his\\r\\nheart; in those spring-times and many-hued meadows shall he not believe,\\r\\nwho knoweth the fickly faint-hearted human species!\\r\\n\\r\\nCOULD they do otherwise, then would they also WILL otherwise. The\\r\\nhalf-and-half spoil every whole. That leaves become withered,--what is\\r\\nthere to lament about that!\\r\\n\\r\\nLet them go and fall away, O Zarathustra, and do not lament! Better even\\r\\nto blow amongst them with rustling winds,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Blow amongst those leaves, O Zarathustra, that everything WITHERED may\\r\\nrun away from thee the faster!--\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have again become pious\"--so do those apostates confess; and some of\\r\\nthem are still too pusillanimous thus to confess.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto them I look into the eye,--before them I say it unto their face and\\r\\nunto the blush on their cheeks: Ye are those who again PRAY!\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is however a shame to pray! Not for all, but for thee, and me, and\\r\\nwhoever hath his conscience in his head. For THEE it is a shame to pray!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou knowest it well: the faint-hearted devil in thee, which would\\r\\nfain fold its arms, and place its hands in its bosom, and take it\\r\\neasier:--this faint-hearted devil persuadeth thee that \"there IS a God!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEREBY, however, dost thou belong to the light-dreading type, to whom\\r\\nlight never permitteth repose: now must thou daily thrust thy head\\r\\ndeeper into obscurity and vapour!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, thou choosest the hour well: for just now do the nocturnal\\r\\nbirds again fly abroad. The hour hath come for all light-dreading\\r\\npeople, the vesper hour and leisure hour, when they do not--\"take\\r\\nleisure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear it and smell it: it hath come--their hour for hunt and\\r\\nprocession, not indeed for a wild hunt, but for a tame, lame, snuffling,\\r\\nsoft-treaders\\', soft-prayers\\' hunt,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--For a hunt after susceptible simpletons: all mouse-traps for the heart\\r\\nhave again been set! And whenever I lift a curtain, a night-moth rusheth\\r\\nout of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid it perhaps squat there along with another night-moth? For everywhere\\r\\ndo I smell small concealed communities; and wherever there are closets\\r\\nthere are new devotees therein, and the atmosphere of devotees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey sit for long evenings beside one another, and say: \"Let us again\\r\\nbecome like little children and say, \\'good God!\\'\"--ruined in mouths and\\r\\nstomachs by the pious confectioners.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr they look for long evenings at a crafty, lurking cross-spider, that\\r\\npreacheth prudence to the spiders themselves, and teacheth that \"under\\r\\ncrosses it is good for cobweb-spinning!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOr they sit all day at swamps with angle-rods, and on that account think\\r\\nthemselves PROFOUND; but whoever fisheth where there are no fish, I do\\r\\nnot even call him superficial!\\r\\n\\r\\nOr they learn in godly-gay style to play the harp with a hymn-poet,\\r\\nwho would fain harp himself into the heart of young girls:--for he hath\\r\\ntired of old girls and their praises.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr they learn to shudder with a learned semi-madcap, who waiteth in\\r\\ndarkened rooms for spirits to come to him--and the spirit runneth away\\r\\nentirely!\\r\\n\\r\\nOr they listen to an old roving howl-and growl-piper, who hath learnt\\r\\nfrom the sad winds the sadness of sounds; now pipeth he as the wind, and\\r\\npreacheth sadness in sad strains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd some of them have even become night-watchmen: they know now how to\\r\\nblow horns, and go about at night and awaken old things which have long\\r\\nfallen asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive words about old things did I hear yester-night at the garden-wall:\\r\\nthey came from such old, sorrowful, arid night-watchmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For a father he careth not sufficiently for his children: human fathers\\r\\ndo this better!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He is too old! He now careth no more for his children,\"--answered the\\r\\nother night-watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"HATH he then children? No one can prove it unless he himself prove it!\\r\\nI have long wished that he would for once prove it thoroughly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Prove? As if HE had ever proved anything! Proving is difficult to him;\\r\\nhe layeth great stress on one\\'s BELIEVING him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ay! Ay! Belief saveth him; belief in him. That is the way with old\\r\\npeople! So it is with us also!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thus spake to each other the two old night-watchmen and light-scarers,\\r\\nand tooted thereupon sorrowfully on their horns: so did it happen\\r\\nyester-night at the garden-wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, however, did the heart writhe with laughter, and was like to\\r\\nbreak; it knew not where to go, and sunk into the midriff.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, it will be my death yet--to choke with laughter when I see asses\\r\\ndrunken, and hear night-watchmen thus doubt about God.\\r\\n\\r\\nHath the time not LONG since passed for all such doubts? Who may\\r\\nnowadays awaken such old slumbering, light-shunning things!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the old Deities hath it long since come to an end:--and verily, a\\r\\ngood joyful Deity-end had they!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey did not \"begloom\" themselves to death--that do people fabricate! On\\r\\nthe contrary, they--LAUGHED themselves to death once on a time!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat took place when the unGodliest utterance came from a God\\r\\nhimself--the utterance: \"There is but one God! Thou shalt have no other\\r\\nGods before me!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--An old grim-beard of a God, a jealous one, forgot himself in such\\r\\nwise:--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the Gods then laughed, and shook upon their thrones, and\\r\\nexclaimed: \"Is it not just divinity that there are Gods, but no God?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe that hath an ear let him hear.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus talked Zarathustra in the city he loved, which is surnamed \"The\\r\\nPied Cow.\" For from here he had but two days to travel to reach once\\r\\nmore his cave and his animals; his soul, however, rejoiced unceasingly\\r\\non account of the nighness of his return home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIII. THE RETURN HOME.\\r\\n\\r\\nO lonesomeness! My HOME, lonesomeness! Too long have I lived wildly in\\r\\nwild remoteness, to return to thee without tears!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow threaten me with the finger as mothers threaten; now smile upon me\\r\\nas mothers smile; now say just: \"Who was it that like a whirlwind once\\r\\nrushed away from me?--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who when departing called out: \\'Too long have I sat with lonesomeness;\\r\\nthere have I unlearned silence!\\' THAT hast thou learned now--surely?\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, everything do I know; and that thou wert MORE FORSAKEN\\r\\namongst the many, thou unique one, than thou ever wert with me!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is forsakenness, another matter is lonesomeness: THAT hast\\r\\nthou now learned! And that amongst men thou wilt ever be wild and\\r\\nstrange:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Wild and strange even when they love thee: for above all they want to\\r\\nbe TREATED INDULGENTLY!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, art thou at home and house with thyself; here canst thou\\r\\nutter everything, and unbosom all motives; nothing is here ashamed of\\r\\nconcealed, congealed feelings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere do all things come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee: for\\r\\nthey want to ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to\\r\\nevery truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nUprightly and openly mayest thou here talk to all things: and verily,\\r\\nit soundeth as praise in their ears, for one to talk to all\\r\\nthings--directly!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother matter, however, is forsakenness. For, dost thou remember, O\\r\\nZarathustra? When thy bird screamed overhead, when thou stoodest in the\\r\\nforest, irresolute, ignorant where to go, beside a corpse:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--When thou spakest: \\'Let mine animals lead me! More dangerous have I\\r\\nfound it among men than among animals:\\'--THAT was forsakenness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thou sattest in thine isle,\\r\\na well of wine giving and granting amongst empty buckets, bestowing and\\r\\ndistributing amongst the thirsty:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Until at last thou alone sattest thirsty amongst the drunken ones, and\\r\\nwailedst nightly: \\'Is taking not more blessed than giving? And stealing\\r\\nyet more blessed than taking?\\'--THAT was forsakenness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd dost thou remember, O Zarathustra? When thy stillest hour came and\\r\\ndrove thee forth from thyself, when with wicked whispering it said:\\r\\n\\'Speak and succumb!\\'--\\r\\n\\r\\n--When it disgusted thee with all thy waiting and silence, and\\r\\ndiscouraged thy humble courage: THAT was forsakenness!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nO lonesomeness! My home, lonesomeness! How blessedly and tenderly\\r\\nspeaketh thy voice unto me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do not question each other, we do not complain to each other; we go\\r\\ntogether openly through open doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all is open with thee and clear; and even the hours run here on\\r\\nlighter feet. For in the dark, time weigheth heavier upon one than in\\r\\nthe light.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere fly open unto me all being\\'s words and word-cabinets: here all\\r\\nbeing wanteth to become words, here all becoming wanteth to learn of me\\r\\nhow to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown there, however--all talking is in vain! There, forgetting and\\r\\npassing-by are the best wisdom: THAT have I learned now!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who would understand everything in man must handle everything. But\\r\\nfor that I have too clean hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not like even to inhale their breath; alas! that I have lived so\\r\\nlong among their noise and bad breaths!\\r\\n\\r\\nO blessed stillness around me! O pure odours around me! How from a deep\\r\\nbreast this stillness fetcheth pure breath! How it hearkeneth, this\\r\\nblessed stillness!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut down there--there speaketh everything, there is everything misheard.\\r\\nIf one announce one\\'s wisdom with bells, the shopmen in the market-place\\r\\nwill out-jingle it with pennies!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything among them talketh; no one knoweth any longer how to\\r\\nunderstand. Everything falleth into the water; nothing falleth any\\r\\nlonger into deep wells.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything among them talketh, nothing succeedeth any longer and\\r\\naccomplisheth itself. Everything cackleth, but who will still sit\\r\\nquietly on the nest and hatch eggs?\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything among them talketh, everything is out-talked. And that which\\r\\nyesterday was still too hard for time itself and its tooth, hangeth\\r\\nto-day, outchamped and outchewed, from the mouths of the men of to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything among them talketh, everything is betrayed. And what was once\\r\\ncalled the secret and secrecy of profound souls, belongeth to-day to the\\r\\nstreet-trumpeters and other butterflies.\\r\\n\\r\\nO human hubbub, thou wonderful thing! Thou noise in dark streets! Now\\r\\nart thou again behind me:--my greatest danger lieth behind me!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger; and all human\\r\\nhubbub wisheth to be indulged and tolerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith suppressed truths, with fool\\'s hand and befooled heart, and rich in\\r\\npetty lies of pity:--thus have I ever lived among men.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisguised did I sit amongst them, ready to misjudge MYSELF that I might\\r\\nendure THEM, and willingly saying to myself: \"Thou fool, thou dost not\\r\\nknow men!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne unlearneth men when one liveth amongst them: there is too much\\r\\nforeground in all men--what can far-seeing, far-longing eyes do THERE!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, fool that I was, when they misjudged me, I indulged them on that\\r\\naccount more than myself, being habitually hard on myself, and often\\r\\neven taking revenge on myself for the indulgence.\\r\\n\\r\\nStung all over by poisonous flies, and hollowed like the stone by\\r\\nmany drops of wickedness: thus did I sit among them, and still said to\\r\\nmyself: \"Innocent is everything petty of its pettiness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially did I find those who call themselves \"the good,\" the most\\r\\npoisonous flies; they sting in all innocence, they lie in all innocence;\\r\\nhow COULD they--be just towards me!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who liveth amongst the good--pity teacheth him to lie. Pity maketh\\r\\nstifling air for all free souls. For the stupidity of the good is\\r\\nunfathomable.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo conceal myself and my riches--THAT did I learn down there: for every\\r\\none did I still find poor in spirit. It was the lie of my pity, that I\\r\\nknew in every one,\\r\\n\\r\\n--That I saw and scented in every one, what was ENOUGH of spirit for\\r\\nhim, and what was TOO MUCH!\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir stiff wise men: I call them wise, not stiff--thus did I learn to\\r\\nslur over words.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grave-diggers dig for themselves diseases. Under old rubbish rest\\r\\nbad vapours. One should not stir up the marsh. One should live on\\r\\nmountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith blessed nostrils do I again breathe mountain-freedom. Freed at last\\r\\nis my nose from the smell of all human hubbub!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith sharp breezes tickled, as with sparkling wine, SNEEZETH my soul--\\r\\nsneezeth, and shouteth self-congratulatingly: \"Health to thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIV. THE THREE EVIL THINGS.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood to-day on a promontory--\\r\\nbeyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and WEIGHED the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, that the rosy dawn came too early to me: she glowed me awake, the\\r\\njealous one! Jealous is she always of the glows of my morning-dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasurable by him who hath time, weighable by a good weigher, attainable\\r\\nby strong pinions, divinable by divine nut-crackers: thus did my dream\\r\\nfind the world:--\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half-hurricane, silent as the\\r\\nbutterfly, impatient as the falcon: how had it the patience and leisure\\r\\nto-day for world-weighing!\\r\\n\\r\\nDid my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it, my laughing, wide-awake\\r\\nday-wisdom, which mocketh at all \"infinite worlds\"? For it saith: \"Where\\r\\nforce is, there becometh NUMBER the master: it hath more force.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow confidently did my dream contemplate this finite world, not\\r\\nnew-fangledly, not old-fangledly, not timidly, not entreatingly:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As if a big round apple presented itself to my hand, a ripe golden\\r\\napple, with a coolly-soft, velvety skin:--thus did the world present\\r\\nitself unto me:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As if a tree nodded unto me, a broad-branched, strong-willed tree,\\r\\ncurved as a recline and a foot-stool for weary travellers: thus did the\\r\\nworld stand on my promontory:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As if delicate hands carried a casket towards me--a casket open for\\r\\nthe delectation of modest adoring eyes: thus did the world present\\r\\nitself before me to-day:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Not riddle enough to scare human love from it, not solution enough\\r\\nto put to sleep human wisdom:--a humanly good thing was the world to me\\r\\nto-day, of which such bad things are said!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow I thank my morning-dream that I thus at to-day\\'s dawn, weighed\\r\\nthe world! As a humanly good thing did it come unto me, this dream and\\r\\nheart-comforter!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that I may do the like by day, and imitate and copy its best, now\\r\\nwill I put the three worst things on the scales, and weigh them humanly\\r\\nwell.--\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who taught to bless taught also to curse: what are the three best\\r\\ncursed things in the world? These will I put on the scales.\\r\\n\\r\\nVOLUPTUOUSNESS, PASSION FOR POWER, and SELFISHNESS: these three things\\r\\nhave hitherto been best cursed, and have been in worst and falsest\\r\\nrepute--these three things will I weigh humanly well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! Here is my promontory, and there is the sea--IT rolleth hither\\r\\nunto me, shaggily and fawningly, the old, faithful, hundred-headed\\r\\ndog-monster that I love!--\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! Here will I hold the scales over the weltering sea: and also a\\r\\nwitness do I choose to look on--thee, the anchorite-tree, thee, the\\r\\nstrong-odoured, broad-arched tree that I love!--\\r\\n\\r\\nOn what bridge goeth the now to the hereafter? By what constraint doth\\r\\nthe high stoop to the low? And what enjoineth even the highest still--to\\r\\ngrow upwards?--\\r\\n\\r\\nNow stand the scales poised and at rest: three heavy questions have I\\r\\nthrown in; three heavy answers carrieth the other scale.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness: unto all hair-shirted despisers of the body, a sting and\\r\\nstake; and, cursed as \"the world,\" by all backworldsmen: for it mocketh\\r\\nand befooleth all erring, misinferring teachers.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness: to the rabble, the slow fire at which it is burnt;\\r\\nto all wormy wood, to all stinking rags, the prepared heat and stew\\r\\nfurnace.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness: to free hearts, a thing innocent and free, the\\r\\ngarden-happiness of the earth, all the future\\'s thanks-overflow to the\\r\\npresent.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness: only to the withered a sweet poison; to the lion-willed,\\r\\nhowever, the great cordial, and the reverently saved wine of wines.\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness: the great symbolic happiness of a higher happiness\\r\\nand highest hope. For to many is marriage promised, and more than\\r\\nmarriage,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--To many that are more unknown to each other than man and woman:--and\\r\\nwho hath fully understood HOW UNKNOWN to each other are man and woman!\\r\\n\\r\\nVoluptuousness:--but I will have hedges around my thoughts, and\\r\\neven around my words, lest swine and libertine should break into my\\r\\ngardens!--\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: the glowing scourge of the hardest of the heart-hard;\\r\\nthe cruel torture reserved for the cruellest themselves; the gloomy\\r\\nflame of living pyres.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: the wicked gadfly which is mounted on the vainest\\r\\npeoples; the scorner of all uncertain virtue; which rideth on every\\r\\nhorse and on every pride.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: the earthquake which breaketh and upbreaketh all\\r\\nthat is rotten and hollow; the rolling, rumbling, punitive demolisher\\r\\nof whited sepulchres; the flashing interrogative-sign beside premature\\r\\nanswers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: before whose glance man creepeth and croucheth and\\r\\ndrudgeth, and becometh lower than the serpent and the swine:--until at\\r\\nlast great contempt crieth out of him--,\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: the terrible teacher of great contempt, which\\r\\npreacheth to their face to cities and empires: \"Away with thee!\"--until\\r\\na voice crieth out of themselves: \"Away with ME!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: which, however, mounteth alluringly even to the pure\\r\\nand lonesome, and up to self-satisfied elevations, glowing like a love\\r\\nthat painteth purple felicities alluringly on earthly heavens.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassion for power: but who would call it PASSION, when the height\\r\\nlongeth to stoop for power! Verily, nothing sick or diseased is there in\\r\\nsuch longing and descending!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the lonesome height may not for ever remain lonesome and\\r\\nself-sufficing; that the mountains may come to the valleys and the winds\\r\\nof the heights to the plains:--\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, who could find the right prenomen and honouring name for such\\r\\nlonging! \"Bestowing virtue\"--thus did Zarathustra once name the\\r\\nunnamable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then it happened also,--and verily, it happened for the first\\r\\ntime!--that his word blessed SELFISHNESS, the wholesome, healthy\\r\\nselfishness, that springeth from the powerful soul:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--From the powerful soul, to which the high body appertaineth, the\\r\\nhandsome, triumphing, refreshing body, around which everything becometh\\r\\na mirror:\\r\\n\\r\\n--The pliant, persuasive body, the dancer, whose symbol and epitome\\r\\nis the self-enjoying soul. Of such bodies and souls the self-enjoyment\\r\\ncalleth itself \"virtue.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith its words of good and bad doth such self-enjoyment shelter itself\\r\\nas with sacred groves; with the names of its happiness doth it banish\\r\\nfrom itself everything contemptible.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from itself doth it banish everything cowardly; it saith:\\r\\n\"Bad--THAT IS cowardly!\" Contemptible seem to it the ever-solicitous,\\r\\nthe sighing, the complaining, and whoever pick up the most trifling\\r\\nadvantage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt despiseth also all bitter-sweet wisdom: for verily, there is also\\r\\nwisdom that bloometh in the dark, a night-shade wisdom, which ever\\r\\nsigheth: \"All is vain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShy distrust is regarded by it as base, and every one who wanteth oaths\\r\\ninstead of looks and hands: also all over-distrustful wisdom,--for such\\r\\nis the mode of cowardly souls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaser still it regardeth the obsequious, doggish one, who immediately\\r\\nlieth on his back, the submissive one; and there is also wisdom that is\\r\\nsubmissive, and doggish, and pious, and obsequious.\\r\\n\\r\\nHateful to it altogether, and a loathing, is he who will never defend\\r\\nhimself, he who swalloweth down poisonous spittle and bad looks, the\\r\\nall-too-patient one, the all-endurer, the all-satisfied one: for that is\\r\\nthe mode of slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether they be servile before Gods and divine spurnings, or before men\\r\\nand stupid human opinions: at ALL kinds of slaves doth it spit, this\\r\\nblessed selfishness!\\r\\n\\r\\nBad: thus doth it call all that is spirit-broken, and\\r\\nsordidly-servile--constrained, blinking eyes, depressed hearts, and the\\r\\nfalse submissive style, which kisseth with broad cowardly lips.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd spurious wisdom: so doth it call all the wit that slaves, and\\r\\nhoary-headed and weary ones affect; and especially all the cunning,\\r\\nspurious-witted, curious-witted foolishness of priests!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spurious wise, however, all the priests, the world-weary, and those\\r\\nwhose souls are of feminine and servile nature--oh, how hath their game\\r\\nall along abused selfishness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd precisely THAT was to be virtue and was to be called virtue--to\\r\\nabuse selfishness! And \"selfless\"--so did they wish themselves with good\\r\\nreason, all those world-weary cowards and cross-spiders!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to all those cometh now the day, the change, the sword of judgment,\\r\\nTHE GREAT NOONTIDE: then shall many things be revealed!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who proclaimeth the EGO wholesome and holy, and selfishness\\r\\nblessed, verily, he, the prognosticator, speaketh also what he knoweth:\\r\\n\"BEHOLD, IT COMETH, IT IS NIGH, THE GREAT NOONTIDE!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLV. THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mouthpiece--is of the people: too coarsely and cordially do I\\r\\ntalk for Angora rabbits. And still stranger soundeth my word unto all\\r\\nink-fish and pen-foxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hand--is a fool\\'s hand: woe unto all tables and walls, and whatever\\r\\nhath room for fool\\'s sketching, fool\\'s scrawling!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy foot--is a horse-foot; therewith do I trample and trot over stick and\\r\\nstone, in the fields up and down, and am bedevilled with delight in all\\r\\nfast racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy stomach--is surely an eagle\\'s stomach? For it preferreth lamb\\'s\\r\\nflesh. Certainly it is a bird\\'s stomach.\\r\\n\\r\\nNourished with innocent things, and with few, ready and impatient\\r\\nto fly, to fly away--that is now my nature: why should there not be\\r\\nsomething of bird-nature therein!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd especially that I am hostile to the spirit of gravity, that is\\r\\nbird-nature:--verily, deadly hostile, supremely hostile, originally\\r\\nhostile! Oh, whither hath my hostility not flown and misflown!\\r\\n\\r\\nThereof could I sing a song--and WILL sing it: though I be alone in an\\r\\nempty house, and must sing it to mine own ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther singers are there, to be sure, to whom only the full house\\r\\nmaketh the voice soft, the hand eloquent, the eye expressive, the heart\\r\\nwakeful:--those do I not resemble.--\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who one day teacheth men to fly will have shifted all landmarks; to\\r\\nhim will all landmarks themselves fly into the air; the earth will he\\r\\nchristen anew--as \"the light body.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ostrich runneth faster than the fastest horse, but it also thrusteth\\r\\nits head heavily into the heavy earth: thus is it with the man who\\r\\ncannot yet fly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeavy unto him are earth and life, and so WILLETH the spirit of gravity!\\r\\nBut he who would become light, and be a bird, must love himself:--thus\\r\\ndo _I_ teach.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot, to be sure, with the love of the sick and infected, for with them\\r\\nstinketh even self-love!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must learn to love oneself--thus do I teach--with a wholesome and\\r\\nhealthy love: that one may endure to be with oneself, and not go roving\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch roving about christeneth itself \"brotherly love\"; with these words\\r\\nhath there hitherto been the best lying and dissembling, and especially\\r\\nby those who have been burdensome to every one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, it is no commandment for to-day and to-morrow to LEARN to\\r\\nlove oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest, subtlest, last and\\r\\npatientest.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor to its possessor is all possession well concealed, and of all\\r\\ntreasure-pits one\\'s own is last excavated--so causeth the spirit of\\r\\ngravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words and worths:\\r\\n\"good\" and \"evil\"--so calleth itself this dowry. For the sake of it we\\r\\nare forgiven for living.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd therefore suffereth one little children to come unto one, to forbid\\r\\nthem betimes to love themselves--so causeth the spirit of gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we--we bear loyally what is apportioned unto us, on hard shoulders,\\r\\nover rugged mountains! And when we sweat, then do people say to us:\\r\\n\"Yea, life is hard to bear!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut man himself only is hard to bear! The reason thereof is that he\\r\\ncarrieth too many extraneous things on his shoulders. Like the camel\\r\\nkneeleth he down, and letteth himself be well laden.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially the strong load-bearing man in whom reverence resideth. Too\\r\\nmany EXTRANEOUS heavy words and worths loadeth he upon himself--then\\r\\nseemeth life to him a desert!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily! Many a thing also that is OUR OWN is hard to bear! And many\\r\\ninternal things in man are like the oyster--repulsive and slippery and\\r\\nhard to grasp;--\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that an elegant shell, with elegant adornment, must plead for\\r\\nthem. But this art also must one learn: to HAVE a shell, and a fine\\r\\nappearance, and sagacious blindness!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, it deceiveth about many things in man, that many a shell is poor\\r\\nand pitiable, and too much of a shell. Much concealed goodness and power\\r\\nis never dreamt of; the choicest dainties find no tasters!\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen know that, the choicest of them: a little fatter a little leaner--\\r\\noh, how much fate is in so little!\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is difficult to discover, and unto himself most difficult of all;\\r\\noften lieth the spirit concerning the soul. So causeth the spirit of\\r\\ngravity.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, hath discovered himself who saith: This is MY good and\\r\\nevil: therewith hath he silenced the mole and the dwarf, who say: \"Good\\r\\nfor all, evil for all.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, neither do I like those who call everything good, and this world\\r\\nthe best of all. Those do I call the all-satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll-satisfiedness, which knoweth how to taste everything,--that is\\r\\nnot the best taste! I honour the refractory, fastidious tongues and\\r\\nstomachs, which have learned to say \"I\" and \"Yea\" and \"Nay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo chew and digest everything, however--that is the genuine\\r\\nswine-nature! Ever to say YE-A--that hath only the ass learnt, and those\\r\\nlike it!--\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep yellow and hot red--so wanteth MY taste--it mixeth blood with all\\r\\ncolours. He, however, who whitewasheth his house, betrayeth unto me a\\r\\nwhitewashed soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith mummies, some fall in love; others with phantoms: both alike\\r\\nhostile to all flesh and blood--oh, how repugnant are both to my taste!\\r\\nFor I love blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there will I not reside and abide where every one spitteth and\\r\\nspeweth: that is now MY taste,--rather would I live amongst thieves and\\r\\nperjurers. Nobody carrieth gold in his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill more repugnant unto me, however, are all lickspittles; and the\\r\\nmost repugnant animal of man that I found, did I christen \"parasite\": it\\r\\nwould not love, and would yet live by love.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnhappy do I call all those who have only one choice: either to become\\r\\nevil beasts, or evil beast-tamers. Amongst such would I not build my\\r\\ntabernacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnhappy do I also call those who have ever to WAIT,--they are repugnant\\r\\nto my taste--all the toll-gatherers and traders, and kings, and other\\r\\nlandkeepers and shopkeepers.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, I learned waiting also, and thoroughly so,--but only waiting for\\r\\nMYSELF. And above all did I learn standing and walking and running and\\r\\nleaping and climbing and dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis however is my teaching: he who wisheth one day to fly, must first\\r\\nlearn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing:--one\\r\\ndoth not fly into flying!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith rope-ladders learned I to reach many a window, with nimble legs did\\r\\nI climb high masts: to sit on high masts of perception seemed to me no\\r\\nsmall bliss;--\\r\\n\\r\\n--To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, certainly,\\r\\nbut a great comfort to cast-away sailors and ship-wrecked ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nBy divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; not by one ladder\\r\\ndid I mount to the height where mine eye roveth into my remoteness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd unwillingly only did I ask my way--that was always counter to my\\r\\ntaste! Rather did I question and test the ways themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nA testing and a questioning hath been all my travelling:--and verily,\\r\\none must also LEARN to answer such questioning! That, however,--is my\\r\\ntaste:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Neither a good nor a bad taste, but MY taste, of which I have no\\r\\nlonger either shame or secrecy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This--is now MY way,--where is yours?\" Thus did I answer those who\\r\\nasked me \"the way.\" For THE way--it doth not exist!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVI. OLD AND NEW TABLES.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere do I sit and wait, old broken tables around me and also new\\r\\nhalf-written tables. When cometh mine hour?\\r\\n\\r\\n--The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go unto\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come unto me that\\r\\nit is MINE hour--namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile do I talk to myself as one who hath time. No one telleth me\\r\\nanything new, so I tell myself mine own story.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came unto men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation:\\r\\nall of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old wearisome business seemed to them all discourse about virtue; and\\r\\nhe who wished to sleep well spake of \"good\" and \"bad\" ere retiring to\\r\\nrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis somnolence did I disturb when I taught that NO ONE YET KNOWETH what\\r\\nis good and bad:--unless it be the creating one!\\r\\n\\r\\n--It is he, however, who createth man\\'s goal, and giveth to the earth\\r\\nits meaning and its future: he only EFFECTETH it THAT aught is good or\\r\\nbad.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and wherever that old\\r\\ninfatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at their great moralists, their\\r\\nsaints, their poets, and their Saviours.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their gloomy sages did I bid them laugh, and whoever had sat\\r\\nadmonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their great grave-highway did I seat myself, and even beside the\\r\\ncarrion and vultures--and I laughed at all their bygone and its mellow\\r\\ndecaying glory.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath and shame\\r\\non all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their best is so very\\r\\nsmall! Oh, that their worst is so very small! Thus did I laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and laugh in me; a\\r\\nwild wisdom, verily!--my great pinion-rustling longing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of\\r\\nlaughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun-intoxicated\\r\\nrapture:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Out into distant futures, which no dream hath yet seen, into warmer\\r\\nsouths than ever sculptor conceived,--where gods in their dancing are\\r\\nashamed of all clothes:\\r\\n\\r\\n(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and\\r\\nverily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere all becoming seemed to me dancing of Gods, and wantoning of Gods,\\r\\nand the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another of many Gods,\\r\\nas the blessed self-contradicting, recommuning, and refraternising with\\r\\none another of many Gods:--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, where\\r\\nnecessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of\\r\\nfreedom:--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere I also found again mine old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit\\r\\nof gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, necessity and\\r\\nconsequence and purpose and will and good and evil:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFor must there not be that which is danced OVER, danced beyond? Must\\r\\nthere not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest,--be moles and\\r\\nclumsy dwarfs?--\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was it also where I picked up from the path the word \"Superman,\"\\r\\nand that man is something that must be surpassed.\\r\\n\\r\\n--That man is a bridge and not a goal--rejoicing over his noontides and\\r\\nevenings, as advances to new rosy dawns:\\r\\n\\r\\n--The Zarathustra word of the great noontide, and whatever else I have\\r\\nhung up over men like purple evening-afterglows.\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, also new stars did I make them see, along with new nights;\\r\\nand over cloud and day and night, did I spread out laughter like a\\r\\ngay-coloured canopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI taught them all MY poetisation and aspiration: to compose and collect\\r\\ninto unity what is fragment in man, and riddle and fearful chance;--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did I teach them\\r\\nto create the future, and all that HATH BEEN--to redeem by creating.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe past of man to redeem, and every \"It was\" to transform, until the\\r\\nWill saith: \"But so did I will it! So shall I will it--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--This did I call redemption; this alone taught I them to call\\r\\nredemption.--\\r\\n\\r\\nNow do I await MY redemption--that I may go unto them for the last time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor once more will I go unto men: AMONGST them will my sun set; in dying\\r\\nwill I give them my choicest gift!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the sun did I learn this, when it goeth down, the exuberant one:\\r\\ngold doth it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--So that the poorest fisherman roweth even with GOLDEN oars! For this\\r\\ndid I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it.--\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sitteth he here\\r\\nand waiteth, old broken tables around him, and also new\\r\\ntables--half-written.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold, here is a new table; but where are my brethren who will carry it\\r\\nwith me to the valley and into hearts of flesh?--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus demandeth my great love to the remotest ones: BE NOT CONSIDERATE OF\\r\\nTHY NEIGHBOUR! Man is something that must be surpassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many divers ways and modes of surpassing: see THOU thereto!\\r\\nBut only a buffoon thinketh: \"man can also be OVERLEAPT.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSurpass thyself even in thy neighbour: and a right which thou canst\\r\\nseize upon, shalt thou not allow to be given thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat thou doest can no one do to thee again. Lo, there is no requital.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a one CAN command\\r\\nhimself, but still sorely lacketh self-obedience!\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus wisheth the type of noble souls: they desire to have nothing\\r\\nGRATUITOUSLY, least of all, life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who is of the populace wisheth to live gratuitously; we others,\\r\\nhowever, to whom life hath given itself--we are ever considering WHAT we\\r\\ncan best give IN RETURN!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, it is a noble dictum which saith: \"What life promiseth US,\\r\\nthat promise will WE keep--to life!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOne should not wish to enjoy where one doth not contribute to the\\r\\nenjoyment. And one should not WISH to enjoy!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things. Neither like\\r\\nto be sought for. One should HAVE them,--but one should rather SEEK for\\r\\nguilt and pain!--\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, however,\\r\\nare we firstlings!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and broil in\\r\\nhonour of ancient idols.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur best is still young: this exciteth old palates. Our flesh is tender,\\r\\nour skin is only lambs\\' skin:--how could we not excite old idol-priests!\\r\\n\\r\\nIN OURSELVES dwelleth he still, the old idol-priest, who broileth our\\r\\nbest for his banquet. Ah, my brethren, how could firstlings fail to be\\r\\nsacrifices!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so wisheth our type; and I love those who do not wish to preserve\\r\\nthemselves, the down-going ones do I love with mine entire love: for\\r\\nthey go beyond.--\\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be true--that CAN few be! And he who can, will not! Least of all,\\r\\nhowever, can the good be true.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, those good ones! GOOD MEN NEVER SPEAK THE TRUTH. For the spirit,\\r\\nthus to be good, is a malady.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; their heart\\r\\nrepeateth, their soul obeyeth: HE, however, who obeyeth, DOTH NOT LISTEN\\r\\nTO HIMSELF!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that is called evil by the good, must come together in order that\\r\\none truth may be born. O my brethren, are ye also evil enough for THIS\\r\\ntruth?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel Nay, the tedium,\\r\\nthe cutting-into-the-quick--how seldom do THESE come together! Out of\\r\\nsuch seed, however--is truth produced!\\r\\n\\r\\nBESIDE the bad conscience hath hitherto grown all KNOWLEDGE! Break up,\\r\\nbreak up, ye discerning ones, the old tables!\\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the water hath planks, when gangways and railings o\\'erspan the\\r\\nstream, verily, he is not believed who then saith: \"All is in flux.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even the simpletons contradict him. \"What?\" say the simpletons, \"all\\r\\nin flux? Planks and railings are still OVER the stream!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"OVER the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges\\r\\nand bearings, all \\'good\\' and \\'evil\\': these are all STABLE!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nCometh, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the\\r\\nwittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: \"Should\\r\\nnot everything--STAND STILL?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fundamentally standeth everything still\"--that is an appropriate winter\\r\\ndoctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for\\r\\nwinter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fundamentally standeth everything still\"--: but CONTRARY thereto,\\r\\npreacheth the thawing wind!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock--a furious\\r\\nbullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaketh the ice! The ice\\r\\nhowever--BREAKETH GANGWAYS!\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX? Have not all\\r\\nrailings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still HOLD ON to\\r\\n\"good\" and \"evil\"?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind bloweth!\"--Thus preach, my\\r\\nbrethren, through all the streets!\\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an old illusion--it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers\\r\\nand astrologers hath hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce did one BELIEVE in soothsayers and astrologers; and THEREFORE did\\r\\none believe, \"Everything is fate: thou shalt, for thou must!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and\\r\\nTHEREFORE did one believe, \"Everything is freedom: thou canst, for thou\\r\\nwillest!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, concerning the stars and the future there hath hitherto\\r\\nbeen only illusion, and not knowledge; and THEREFORE concerning good and\\r\\nevil there hath hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge!\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not slay!\"--such precepts were once\\r\\ncalled holy; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off\\r\\none\\'s shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and slayers in\\r\\nthe world than such holy precepts?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there not even in all life--robbing and slaying? And for such\\r\\nprecepts to be called holy, was not TRUTH itself thereby--slain?\\r\\n\\r\\n--Or was it a sermon of death that called holy what contradicted and\\r\\ndissuaded from life?--O my brethren, break up, break up for me the old\\r\\ntables!\\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is abandoned,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Abandoned to the favour, the spirit and the madness of every\\r\\ngeneration that cometh, and reinterpreteth all that hath been as its\\r\\nbridge!\\r\\n\\r\\nA great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with approval and\\r\\ndisapproval could strain and constrain all the past, until it became for\\r\\nhim a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, and a cock-crowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis however is the other danger, and mine other sympathy:--he who is\\r\\nof the populace, his thoughts go back to his grandfather,--with his\\r\\ngrandfather, however, doth time cease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus is all the past abandoned: for it might some day happen for the\\r\\npopulace to become master, and drown all time in shallow waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, O my brethren, a NEW NOBILITY is needed, which shall be the\\r\\nadversary of all populace and potentate rule, and shall inscribe anew\\r\\nthe word \"noble\" on new tables.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble ones, FOR A NEW\\r\\nNOBILITY! Or, as I once said in parable: \"That is just divinity, that\\r\\nthere are Gods, but no God!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n12.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, I consecrate you and point you to a new nobility: ye\\r\\nshall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future;--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Verily, not to a nobility which ye could purchase like traders with\\r\\ntraders\\' gold; for little worth is all that hath its price.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet it not be your honour henceforth whence ye come, but whither ye go!\\r\\nYour Will and your feet which seek to surpass you--let these be your new\\r\\nhonour!\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, not that ye have served a prince--of what account are princes\\r\\nnow!--nor that ye have become a bulwark to that which standeth, that it\\r\\nmay stand more firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that your family have become courtly at courts, and that ye have\\r\\nlearned--gay-coloured, like the flamingo--to stand long hours in shallow\\r\\npools:\\r\\n\\r\\n(For ABILITY-to-stand is a merit in courtiers; and all courtiers believe\\r\\nthat unto blessedness after death pertaineth--PERMISSION-to-sit!)\\r\\n\\r\\nNor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into promised\\r\\nlands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of all trees grew--the\\r\\ncross,--in that land there is nothing to praise!--\\r\\n\\r\\n--And verily, wherever this \"Holy Spirit\" led its knights, always in\\r\\nsuch campaigns did--goats and geese, and wryheads and guyheads run\\r\\nFOREMOST!--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but OUTWARD!\\r\\nExiles shall ye be from all fatherlands and forefather-lands!\\r\\n\\r\\nYour CHILDREN\\'S LAND shall ye love: let this love be your new\\r\\nnobility,--the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid your\\r\\nsails search and search!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto your children shall ye MAKE AMENDS for being the children of your\\r\\nfathers: all the past shall ye THUS redeem! This new table do I place\\r\\nover you!\\r\\n\\r\\n13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should one live? All is vain! To live--that is to thrash straw; to\\r\\nlive--that is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch ancient babbling still passeth for \"wisdom\"; because it is old,\\r\\nhowever, and smelleth mustily, THEREFORE is it the more honoured. Even\\r\\nmould ennobleth.--\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren might thus speak: they SHUN the fire because it hath burnt\\r\\nthem! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who ever \"thrasheth straw,\" why should he be allowed to rail at\\r\\nthrashing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even\\r\\ngood hunger:--and then do they rail: \"All is vain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to eat and drink well, my brethren, is verily no vain art! Break up,\\r\\nbreak up for me the tables of the never-joyous ones!\\r\\n\\r\\n14.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To the clean are all things clean\"--thus say the people. I, however,\\r\\nsay unto you: To the swine all things become swinish!\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore preach the visionaries and bowed-heads (whose hearts are also\\r\\nbowed down): \"The world itself is a filthy monster.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor these are all unclean spirits; especially those, however, who have\\r\\nno peace or rest, unless they see the world FROM THE BACKSIDE--the\\r\\nbackworldsmen!\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THOSE do I say it to the face, although it sound unpleasantly: the\\r\\nworld resembleth man, in that it hath a backside,--SO MUCH is true!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is in the world much filth: SO MUCH is true! But the world itself\\r\\nis not therefore a filthy monster!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smelleth badly:\\r\\nloathing itself createth wings, and fountain-divining powers!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the best there is still something to loathe; and the best is still\\r\\nsomething that must be surpassed!--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, there is much wisdom in the fact that much filth is in\\r\\nthe world!--\\r\\n\\r\\n15.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch sayings did I hear pious backworldsmen speak to their consciences,\\r\\nand verily without wickedness or guile,--although there is nothing more\\r\\nguileful in the world, or more wicked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let the world be as it is! Raise not a finger against it!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people: raise\\r\\nnot a finger against it! Thereby will they learn to renounce the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thine own reason--this shalt thou thyself stifle and choke; for it\\r\\nis a reason of this world,--thereby wilt thou learn thyself to renounce\\r\\nthe world.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Shatter, shatter, O my brethren, those old tables of the pious! Tatter\\r\\nthe maxims of the world-maligners!--\\r\\n\\r\\n16.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He who learneth much unlearneth all violent cravings\"--that do people\\r\\nnow whisper to one another in all the dark lanes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wisdom wearieth, nothing is worth while; thou shalt not crave!\"--this\\r\\nnew table found I hanging even in the public markets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreak up for me, O my brethren, break up also that NEW table! The\\r\\nweary-o\\'-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer:\\r\\nfor lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:--\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early\\r\\nand everything too fast; because they ATE badly: from thence hath\\r\\nresulted their ruined stomach;--\\r\\n\\r\\n--For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: IT persuadeth to death! For\\r\\nverily, my brethren, the spirit IS a stomach!\\r\\n\\r\\nLife is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach\\r\\nspeaketh, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo discern: that is DELIGHT to the lion-willed! But he who hath become\\r\\nweary, is himself merely \"willed\"; with him play all the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their\\r\\nway. And at last asketh their weariness: \"Why did we ever go on the way?\\r\\nAll is indifferent!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTO THEM soundeth it pleasant to have preached in their ears: \"Nothing is\\r\\nworth while! Ye shall not will!\" That, however, is a sermon for slavery.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, a fresh blustering wind cometh Zarathustra unto all\\r\\nway-weary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze!\\r\\n\\r\\nEven through walls bloweth my free breath, and in into prisons and\\r\\nimprisoned spirits!\\r\\n\\r\\nWilling emancipateth: for willing is creating: so do I teach. And ONLY\\r\\nfor creating shall ye learn!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd also the learning shall ye LEARN only from me, the learning\\r\\nwell!--He who hath ears let him hear!\\r\\n\\r\\n17.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere standeth the boat--thither goeth it over, perhaps into vast\\r\\nnothingness--but who willeth to enter into this \"Perhaps\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nNone of you want to enter into the death-boat! How should ye then be\\r\\nWORLD-WEARY ones!\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld-weary ones! And have not even withdrawn from the earth! Eager\\r\\ndid I ever find you for the earth, amorous still of your own\\r\\nearth-weariness!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot in vain doth your lip hang down:--a small worldly wish still sitteth\\r\\nthereon! And in your eye--floateth there not a cloudlet of unforgotten\\r\\nearthly bliss?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are on the earth many good inventions, some useful, some pleasant:\\r\\nfor their sake is the earth to be loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd many such good inventions are there, that they are like woman\\'s\\r\\nbreasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe world-weary ones, however! Ye earth-idlers! You, shall one beat with\\r\\nstripes! With stripes shall one again make you sprightly limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor if ye be not invalids, or decrepit creatures, of whom the earth is\\r\\nweary, then are ye sly sloths, or dainty, sneaking pleasure-cats. And if\\r\\nye will not again RUN gaily, then shall ye--pass away!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the incurable shall one not seek to be a physician: thus teacheth\\r\\nZarathustra:--so shall ye pass away!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut more COURAGE is needed to make an end than to make a new verse: that\\r\\ndo all physicians and poets know well.--\\r\\n\\r\\n18.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, there are tables which weariness framed, and tables\\r\\nwhich slothfulness framed, corrupt slothfulness: although they speak\\r\\nsimilarly, they want to be heard differently.--\\r\\n\\r\\nSee this languishing one! Only a span-breadth is he from his goal; but\\r\\nfrom weariness hath he lain down obstinately in the dust, this brave\\r\\none!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom weariness yawneth he at the path, at the earth, at the goal, and at\\r\\nhimself: not a step further will he go,--this brave one!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow gloweth the sun upon him, and the dogs lick at his sweat: but he\\r\\nlieth there in his obstinacy and preferreth to languish:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--A span-breadth from his goal, to languish! Verily, ye will have to\\r\\ndrag him into his heaven by the hair of his head--this hero!\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter still that ye let him lie where he hath lain down, that sleep may\\r\\ncome unto him, the comforter, with cooling patter-rain.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet him lie, until of his own accord he awakeneth,--until of his own\\r\\naccord he repudiateth all weariness, and what weariness hath taught\\r\\nthrough him!\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly, my brethren, see that ye scare the dogs away from him, the idle\\r\\nskulkers, and all the swarming vermin:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--All the swarming vermin of the \"cultured,\" that--feast on the sweat of\\r\\nevery hero!--\\r\\n\\r\\n19.\\r\\n\\r\\nI form circles around me and holy boundaries; ever fewer ascend with\\r\\nme ever higher mountains: I build a mountain-range out of ever holier\\r\\nmountains.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wherever ye would ascend with me, O my brethren, take care lest a\\r\\nPARASITE ascend with you!\\r\\n\\r\\nA parasite: that is a reptile, a creeping, cringing reptile, that trieth\\r\\nto fatten on your infirm and sore places.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd THIS is its art: it divineth where ascending souls are weary, in\\r\\nyour trouble and dejection, in your sensitive modesty, doth it build its\\r\\nloathsome nest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the strong are weak, where the noble are all-too-gentle--there\\r\\nbuildeth it its loathsome nest; the parasite liveth where the great have\\r\\nsmall sore-places.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the highest of all species of being, and what is the lowest?\\r\\nThe parasite is the lowest species; he, however, who is of the highest\\r\\nspecies feedeth most parasites.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the soul which hath the longest ladder, and can go deepest down: how\\r\\ncould there fail to be most parasites upon it?--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The most comprehensive soul, which can run and stray and rove furthest\\r\\nin itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy flingeth itself\\r\\ninto chance:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The soul in Being, which plungeth into Becoming; the possessing soul,\\r\\nwhich SEEKETH to attain desire and longing:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The soul fleeing from itself, which overtaketh itself in the widest\\r\\ncircuit; the wisest soul, unto which folly speaketh most sweetly:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The soul most self-loving, in which all things have their current and\\r\\ncounter-current, their ebb and their flow:--oh, how could THE LOFTIEST\\r\\nSOUL fail to have the worst parasites?\\r\\n\\r\\n20.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, am I then cruel? But I say: What falleth, that shall one\\r\\nalso push!\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything of to-day--it falleth, it decayeth; who would preserve it!\\r\\nBut I--I wish also to push it!\\r\\n\\r\\nKnow ye the delight which rolleth stones into precipitous depths?--Those\\r\\nmen of to-day, see just how they roll into my depths!\\r\\n\\r\\nA prelude am I to better players, O my brethren! An example! DO\\r\\naccording to mine example!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd him whom ye do not teach to fly, teach I pray you--TO FALL FASTER!--\\r\\n\\r\\n21.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman,--one must also\\r\\nknow WHEREON to use swordsmanship!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd often is it greater bravery to keep quiet and pass by, that THEREBY\\r\\none may reserve oneself for a worthier foe!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: ye\\r\\nmust be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the worthier foe, O my brethren, shall ye reserve yourselves:\\r\\ntherefore must ye pass by many a one,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with noise about\\r\\npeople and peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there much right,\\r\\nmuch wrong: he who looketh on becometh wroth.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherein viewing, therein hewing--they are the same thing: therefore\\r\\ndepart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!\\r\\n\\r\\nGo YOUR ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!--gloomy ways,\\r\\nverily, on which not a single hope glinteth any more!\\r\\n\\r\\nLet there the trader rule, where all that still glittereth is--traders\\'\\r\\ngold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calleth itself\\r\\nthe people is unworthy of kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick\\r\\nup the smallest advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lay lures for one another, they lure things out of one\\r\\nanother,--that they call \"good neighbourliness.\" O blessed remote period\\r\\nwhen a people said to itself: \"I will be--MASTER over peoples!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor, my brethren, the best shall rule, the best also WILLETH to rule!\\r\\nAnd where the teaching is different, there--the best is LACKING.\\r\\n\\r\\n22.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf THEY had--bread for nothing, alas! for what would THEY cry! Their\\r\\nmaintainment--that is their true entertainment; and they shall have it\\r\\nhard!\\r\\n\\r\\nBeasts of prey, are they: in their \"working\"--there is even plundering,\\r\\nin their \"earning\"--there is even overreaching! Therefore shall they\\r\\nhave it hard!\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter beasts of prey shall they thus become, subtler, cleverer, MORE\\r\\nMAN-LIKE: for man is the best beast of prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the animals hath man already robbed of their virtues: that is why of\\r\\nall animals it hath been hardest for man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the birds are still beyond him. And if man should yet learn to fly,\\r\\nalas! TO WHAT HEIGHT--would his rapacity fly!\\r\\n\\r\\n23.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus would I have man and woman: fit for war, the one; fit for\\r\\nmaternity, the other; both, however, fit for dancing with head and legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd lost be the day to us in which a measure hath not been danced. And\\r\\nfalse be every truth which hath not had laughter along with it!\\r\\n\\r\\n24.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour marriage-arranging: see that it be not a bad ARRANGING! Ye have\\r\\narranged too hastily: so there FOLLOWETH therefrom--marriage-breaking!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd better marriage-breaking than marriage-bending,\\r\\nmarriage-lying!--Thus spake a woman unto me: \"Indeed, I broke the\\r\\nmarriage, but first did the marriage break--me!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe badly paired found I ever the most revengeful: they make every one\\r\\nsuffer for it that they no longer run singly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that account want I the honest ones to say to one another: \"We love\\r\\neach other: let us SEE TO IT that we maintain our love! Or shall our\\r\\npledging be blundering?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may see if we are\\r\\nfit for the great marriage! It is a great matter always to be twain.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus do I counsel all honest ones; and what would be my love to the\\r\\nSuperman, and to all that is to come, if I should counsel and speak\\r\\notherwise!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only to propagate yourselves onwards but UPWARDS--thereto, O my\\r\\nbrethren, may the garden of marriage help you!\\r\\n\\r\\n25.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who hath grown wise concerning old origins, lo, he will at last seek\\r\\nafter the fountains of the future and new origins.--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, not long will it be until NEW PEOPLES shall arise and new\\r\\nfountains shall rush down into new depths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the earthquake--it choketh up many wells, it causeth much\\r\\nlanguishing: but it bringeth also to light inner powers and secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earthquake discloseth new fountains. In the earthquake of old\\r\\npeoples new fountains burst forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whoever calleth out: \"Lo, here is a well for many thirsty ones, one\\r\\nheart for many longing ones, one will for many instruments\":--around him\\r\\ncollecteth a PEOPLE, that is to say, many attempting ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can command, who must obey--THAT IS THERE ATTEMPTED! Ah, with what\\r\\nlong seeking and solving and failing and learning and re-attempting!\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman society: it is an attempt--so I teach--a long seeking: it seeketh\\r\\nhowever the ruler!--\\r\\n\\r\\n--An attempt, my brethren! And NO \"contract\"! Destroy, I pray you,\\r\\ndestroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and-half!\\r\\n\\r\\n26.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren! With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human\\r\\nfuture? Is it not with the good and just?--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As those who say and feel in their hearts: \"We already know what\\r\\nis good and just, we possess it also; woe to those who still seek\\r\\nthereafter!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the good is the\\r\\nharmfulest harm!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm of the good is\\r\\nthe harmfulest harm!\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, into the hearts of the good and just looked some one\\r\\nonce on a time, who said: \"They are the Pharisees.\" But people did not\\r\\nunderstand him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good and just themselves were not free to understand him; their\\r\\nspirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the\\r\\ngood is unfathomably wise.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the truth, however, that the good MUST be Pharisees--they have no\\r\\nchoice!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good MUST crucify him who deviseth his own virtue! That IS the\\r\\ntruth!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second one, however, who discovered their country--the country,\\r\\nheart and soil of the good and just,--it was he who asked: \"Whom do they\\r\\nhate most?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CREATOR, hate they most, him who breaketh the tables and old values,\\r\\nthe breaker,--him they call the law-breaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the good--they CANNOT create; they are always the beginning of the\\r\\nend:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables, they sacrifice\\r\\nUNTO THEMSELVES the future--they crucify the whole human future!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good--they have always been the beginning of the end.--\\r\\n\\r\\n27.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, have ye also understood this word? And what I once said\\r\\nof the \"last man\"?--\\r\\n\\r\\nWith whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not\\r\\nwith the good and just?\\r\\n\\r\\nBREAK UP, BREAK UP, I PRAY YOU, THE GOOD AND JUST!--O my brethren, have\\r\\nye understood also this word?\\r\\n\\r\\n28.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe flee from me? Ye are frightened? Ye tremble at this word?\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, when I enjoined you to break up the good, and the tables\\r\\nof the good, then only did I embark man on his high seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only cometh unto him the great terror, the great outlook, the\\r\\ngreat sickness, the great nausea, the great sea-sickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFalse shores and false securities did the good teach you; in the lies of\\r\\nthe good were ye born and bred. Everything hath been radically contorted\\r\\nand distorted by the good.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he who discovered the country of \"man,\" discovered also the country\\r\\nof \"man\\'s future.\" Now shall ye be sailors for me, brave, patient!\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep yourselves up betimes, my brethren, learn to keep yourselves up!\\r\\nThe sea stormeth: many seek to raise themselves again by you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sea stormeth: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! Ye old\\r\\nseaman-hearts!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of fatherland! THITHER striveth our helm where our CHILDREN\\'S LAND\\r\\nis! Thitherwards, stormier than the sea, stormeth our great longing!--\\r\\n\\r\\n29.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why so hard!\"--said to the diamond one day the charcoal; \"are we then\\r\\nnot near relatives?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy so soft? O my brethren; thus do _I_ ask you: are ye then not--my\\r\\nbrethren?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so much negation\\r\\nand abnegation in your hearts? Why is there so little fate in your\\r\\nlooks?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can ye one day--\\r\\nconquer with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to pieces, how can\\r\\nye one day--create with me?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the creators are hard. And blessedness must it seem to you to press\\r\\nyour hand upon millenniums as upon wax,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as upon\\r\\nbrass,--harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely hard is only the\\r\\nnoblest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new table, O my brethren, put I up over you: BECOME HARD!--\\r\\n\\r\\n30.\\r\\n\\r\\nO thou, my Will! Thou change of every need, MY needfulness! Preserve me\\r\\nfrom all small victories!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou fatedness of my soul, which I call fate! Thou In-me! Over-me!\\r\\nPreserve and spare me for one great fate!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thy last greatness, my Will, spare it for thy last--that thou mayest\\r\\nbe inexorable IN thy victory! Ah, who hath not succumbed to his victory!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, whose eye hath not bedimmed in this intoxicated twilight! Ah, whose\\r\\nfoot hath not faltered and forgotten in victory--how to stand!--\\r\\n\\r\\n--That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noontide: ready and\\r\\nripe like the glowing ore, the lightning-bearing cloud, and the swelling\\r\\nmilk-udder:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ready for myself and for my most hidden Will: a bow eager for its\\r\\narrow, an arrow eager for its star:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--A star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, pierced, blessed, by\\r\\nannihilating sun-arrows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--A sun itself, and an inexorable sun-will, ready for annihilation in\\r\\nvictory!\\r\\n\\r\\nO Will, thou change of every need, MY needfulness! Spare me for one\\r\\ngreat victory!---\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVII. THE CONVALESCENT.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, not long after his return to his cave, Zarathustra sprang\\r\\nup from his couch like a madman, crying with a frightful voice, and\\r\\nacting as if some one still lay on the couch who did not wish to rise.\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s voice also resounded in such a manner that his animals\\r\\ncame to him frightened, and out of all the neighbouring caves and\\r\\nlurking-places all the creatures slipped away--flying, fluttering,\\r\\ncreeping or leaping, according to their variety of foot or wing.\\r\\nZarathustra, however, spake these words:\\r\\n\\r\\nUp, abysmal thought out of my depth! I am thy cock and morning dawn,\\r\\nthou overslept reptile: Up! Up! My voice shall soon crow thee awake!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnbind the fetters of thine ears: listen! For I wish to hear thee! Up!\\r\\nUp! There is thunder enough to make the very graves listen!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rub the sleep and all the dimness and blindness out of thine eyes!\\r\\nHear me also with thine eyes: my voice is a medicine even for those born\\r\\nblind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once thou art awake, then shalt thou ever remain awake. It is not\\r\\nMY custom to awake great-grandmothers out of their sleep that I may bid\\r\\nthem--sleep on!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou stirrest, stretchest thyself, wheezest? Up! Up! Not wheeze, shalt\\r\\nthou,--but speak unto me! Zarathustra calleth thee, Zarathustra the\\r\\ngodless!\\r\\n\\r\\nI, Zarathustra, the advocate of living, the advocate of suffering, the\\r\\nadvocate of the circuit--thee do I call, my most abysmal thought!\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy to me! Thou comest,--I hear thee! Mine abyss SPEAKETH, my lowest\\r\\ndepth have I turned over into the light!\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy to me! Come hither! Give me thy hand--ha! let be! aha!--Disgust,\\r\\ndisgust, disgust--alas to me!\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly, however, had Zarathustra spoken these words, when he fell down\\r\\nas one dead, and remained long as one dead. When however he again came\\r\\nto himself, then was he pale and trembling, and remained lying; and for\\r\\nlong he would neither eat nor drink. This condition continued for seven\\r\\ndays; his animals, however, did not leave him day nor night, except that\\r\\nthe eagle flew forth to fetch food. And what it fetched and foraged,\\r\\nit laid on Zarathustra\\'s couch: so that Zarathustra at last lay among\\r\\nyellow and red berries, grapes, rosy apples, sweet-smelling herbage, and\\r\\npine-cones. At his feet, however, two lambs were stretched, which the\\r\\neagle had with difficulty carried off from their shepherds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, after seven days, Zarathustra raised himself upon his couch,\\r\\ntook a rosy apple in his hand, smelt it and found its smell pleasant.\\r\\nThen did his animals think the time had come to speak unto him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" said they, \"now hast thou lain thus for seven days with\\r\\nheavy eyes: wilt thou not set thyself again upon thy feet?\\r\\n\\r\\nStep out of thy cave: the world waiteth for thee as a garden. The wind\\r\\nplayeth with heavy fragrance which seeketh for thee; and all brooks\\r\\nwould like to run after thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll things long for thee, since thou hast remained alone for seven\\r\\ndays--step forth out of thy cave! All things want to be thy physicians!\\r\\n\\r\\nDid perhaps a new knowledge come to thee, a bitter, grievous knowledge?\\r\\nLike leavened dough layest thou, thy soul arose and swelled beyond all\\r\\nits bounds.--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--O mine animals, answered Zarathustra, talk on thus and let me listen!\\r\\nIt refresheth me so to hear your talk: where there is talk, there is the\\r\\nworld as a garden unto me.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow charming it is that there are words and tones; are not words and\\r\\ntones rainbows and seeming bridges \\'twixt the eternally separated?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo each soul belongeth another world; to each soul is every other soul a\\r\\nback-world.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the most alike doth semblance deceive most delightfully: for the\\r\\nsmallest gap is most difficult to bridge over.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me--how could there be an outside-of-me? There is no outside! But\\r\\nthis we forget on hearing tones; how delightful it is that we forget!\\r\\n\\r\\nHave not names and tones been given unto things that man may refresh\\r\\nhimself with them? It is a beautiful folly, speaking; therewith danceth\\r\\nman over everything.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow lovely is all speech and all falsehoods of tones! With tones danceth\\r\\nour love on variegated rainbows.--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"O Zarathustra,\" said then his animals, \"to those who think like us,\\r\\nthings all dance themselves: they come and hold out the hand and laugh\\r\\nand flee--and return.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything goeth, everything returneth; eternally rolleth the wheel\\r\\nof existence. Everything dieth, everything blossometh forth again;\\r\\neternally runneth on the year of existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything breaketh, everything is integrated anew; eternally buildeth\\r\\nitself the same house of existence. All things separate, all things\\r\\nagain greet one another; eternally true to itself remaineth the ring of\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery moment beginneth existence, around every \\'Here\\' rolleth the ball\\r\\n\\'There.\\' The middle is everywhere. Crooked is the path of eternity.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--O ye wags and barrel-organs! answered Zarathustra, and smiled once\\r\\nmore, how well do ye know what had to be fulfilled in seven days:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--And how that monster crept into my throat and choked me! But I bit off\\r\\nits head and spat it away from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ye--ye have made a lyre-lay out of it? Now, however, do I lie here,\\r\\nstill exhausted with that biting and spitting-away, still sick with mine\\r\\nown salvation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAND YE LOOKED ON AT IT ALL? O mine animals, are ye also cruel? Did\\r\\nye like to look at my great pain as men do? For man is the cruellest\\r\\nanimal.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto been\\r\\nhappiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, that was his\\r\\nheaven on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the great man crieth--: immediately runneth the little man thither,\\r\\nand his tongue hangeth out of his mouth for very lusting. He, however,\\r\\ncalleth it his \"pity.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man, especially the poet--how passionately doth he accuse\\r\\nlife in words! Hearken to him, but do not fail to hear the delight which\\r\\nis in all accusation!\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch accusers of life--them life overcometh with a glance of the eye.\\r\\n\"Thou lovest me?\" saith the insolent one; \"wait a little, as yet have I\\r\\nno time for thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards himself man is the cruellest animal; and in all who call\\r\\nthemselves \"sinners\" and \"bearers of the cross\" and \"penitents,\" do not\\r\\noverlook the voluptuousness in their plaints and accusations!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I myself--do I thereby want to be man\\'s accuser? Ah, mine animals,\\r\\nthis only have I learned hitherto, that for man his baddest is necessary\\r\\nfor his best,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--That all that is baddest is the best POWER, and the hardest stone for\\r\\nthe highest creator; and that man must become better AND badder:--\\r\\n\\r\\nNot to THIS torture-stake was I tied, that I know man is bad,--but I\\r\\ncried, as no one hath yet cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ah, that his baddest is so very small! Ah, that his best is so very\\r\\nsmall!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great disgust at man--IT strangled me and had crept into my throat:\\r\\nand what the soothsayer had presaged: \"All is alike, nothing is worth\\r\\nwhile, knowledge strangleth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA long twilight limped on before me, a fatally weary, fatally\\r\\nintoxicated sadness, which spake with yawning mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Eternally he returneth, the man of whom thou art weary, the small\\r\\nman\"--so yawned my sadness, and dragged its foot and could not go to\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cavern, became the human earth to me; its breast caved in; everything\\r\\nliving became to me human dust and bones and mouldering past.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sighing sat on all human graves, and could no longer arise: my\\r\\nsighing and questioning croaked and choked, and gnawed and nagged day\\r\\nand night:\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Ah, man returneth eternally! The small man returneth eternally!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNaked had I once seen both of them, the greatest man and the smallest\\r\\nman: all too like one another--all too human, even the greatest man!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll too small, even the greatest man!--that was my disgust at man! And\\r\\nthe eternal return also of the smallest man!--that was my disgust at all\\r\\nexistence!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, Disgust! Disgust! Disgust!--Thus spake Zarathustra, and sighed and\\r\\nshuddered; for he remembered his sickness. Then did his animals prevent\\r\\nhim from speaking further.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do not speak further, thou convalescent!\"--so answered his animals,\\r\\n\"but go out where the world waiteth for thee like a garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo out unto the roses, the bees, and the flocks of doves! Especially,\\r\\nhowever, unto the singing-birds, to learn SINGING from them!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor singing is for the convalescent; the sound ones may talk. And\\r\\nwhen the sound also want songs, then want they other songs than the\\r\\nconvalescent.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"O ye wags and barrel-organs, do be silent!\" answered Zarathustra, and\\r\\nsmiled at his animals. \"How well ye know what consolation I devised for\\r\\nmyself in seven days!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I have to sing once more--THAT consolation did I devise for myself,\\r\\nand THIS convalescence: would ye also make another lyre-lay thereof?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Do not talk further,\" answered his animals once more; \"rather, thou\\r\\nconvalescent, prepare for thyself first a lyre, a new lyre!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor behold, O Zarathustra! For thy new lays there are needed new lyres.\\r\\n\\r\\nSing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal thy soul with new lays: that\\r\\nthou mayest bear thy great fate, which hath not yet been any one\\'s fate!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thine animals know it well, O Zarathustra, who thou art and must\\r\\nbecome: behold, THOU ART THE TEACHER OF THE ETERNAL RETURN,--that is now\\r\\nTHY fate!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat thou must be the first to teach this teaching--how could this great\\r\\nfate not be thy greatest danger and infirmity!\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold, we know what thou teachest: that all things eternally return,\\r\\nand ourselves with them, and that we have already existed times without\\r\\nnumber, and all things with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou teachest that there is a great year of Becoming, a prodigy of a\\r\\ngreat year; it must, like a sand-glass, ever turn up anew, that it may\\r\\nanew run down and run out:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--So that all those years are like one another in the greatest and also\\r\\nin the smallest, so that we ourselves, in every great year, are like\\r\\nourselves in the greatest and also in the smallest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if thou wouldst now die, O Zarathustra, behold, we know also how\\r\\nthou wouldst then speak to thyself:--but thine animals beseech thee not\\r\\nto die yet!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou wouldst speak, and without trembling, buoyant rather with bliss,\\r\\nfor a great weight and worry would be taken from thee, thou patientest\\r\\none!--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Now do I die and disappear,\\' wouldst thou say, \\'and in a moment I am\\r\\nnothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the plexus of causes returneth in which I am intertwined,--it will\\r\\nagain create me! I myself pertain to the causes of the eternal return.\\r\\n\\r\\nI come again with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this\\r\\nserpent--NOT to a new life, or a better life, or a similar life:\\r\\n\\r\\n--I come again eternally to this identical and selfsame life, in its\\r\\ngreatest and its smallest, to teach again the eternal return of all\\r\\nthings,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--To speak again the word of the great noontide of earth and man, to\\r\\nannounce again to man the Superman.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have spoken my word. I break down by my word: so willeth mine eternal\\r\\nfate--as announcer do I succumb!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hour hath now come for the down-goer to bless himself. Thus--ENDETH\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s down-going.\\'\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the animals had spoken these words they were silent and waited, so\\r\\nthat Zarathustra might say something to them: but Zarathustra did not\\r\\nhear that they were silent. On the contrary, he lay quietly with closed\\r\\neyes like a person sleeping, although he did not sleep; for he communed\\r\\njust then with his soul. The serpent, however, and the eagle, when they\\r\\nfound him silent in such wise, respected the great stillness around him,\\r\\nand prudently retired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLVIII. THE GREAT LONGING.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I have taught thee to say \"to-day\" as \"once on a time\" and\\r\\n\"formerly,\" and to dance thy measure over every Here and There and\\r\\nYonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I delivered thee from all by-places, I brushed down from thee\\r\\ndust and spiders and twilight.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I washed the petty shame and the by-place virtue from thee,\\r\\nand persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes of the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the storm that is called \"spirit\" did I blow over thy surging\\r\\nsea; all clouds did I blow away from it; I strangled even the strangler\\r\\ncalled \"sin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I gave thee the right to say Nay like the storm, and to say\\r\\nYea as the open heaven saith Yea: calm as the light remainest thou, and\\r\\nnow walkest through denying storms.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I restored to thee liberty over the created and the\\r\\nuncreated; and who knoweth, as thou knowest, the voluptuousness of the\\r\\nfuture?\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I taught thee the contempt which doth not come like\\r\\nworm-eating, the great, the loving contempt, which loveth most where it\\r\\ncontemneth most.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I taught thee so to persuade that thou persuadest even the\\r\\ngrounds themselves to thee: like the sun, which persuadeth even the sea\\r\\nto its height.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I have taken from thee all obeying and knee-bending and\\r\\nhomage-paying; I have myself given thee the names, \"Change of need\" and\\r\\n\"Fate.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I have given thee new names and gay-coloured playthings,\\r\\nI have called thee \"Fate\" and \"the Circuit of circuits\" and \"the\\r\\nNavel-string of time\" and \"the Azure bell.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, to thy domain gave I all wisdom to drink, all new wines, and\\r\\nalso all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, every sun shed I upon thee, and every night and every silence\\r\\nand every longing:--then grewest thou up for me as a vine.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, exuberant and heavy dost thou now stand forth, a vine with\\r\\nswelling udders and full clusters of brown golden grapes:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Filled and weighted by thy happiness, waiting from superabundance, and\\r\\nyet ashamed of thy waiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, there is nowhere a soul which could be more loving and more\\r\\ncomprehensive and more extensive! Where could future and past be closer\\r\\ntogether than with thee?\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I have given thee everything, and all my hands have become\\r\\nempty by thee:--and now! Now sayest thou to me, smiling and full of\\r\\nmelancholy: \"Which of us oweth thanks?--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Doth the giver not owe thanks because the receiver received? Is\\r\\nbestowing not a necessity? Is receiving not--pitying?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, I understand the smiling of thy melancholy: thine\\r\\nover-abundance itself now stretcheth out longing hands!\\r\\n\\r\\nThy fulness looketh forth over raging seas, and seeketh and waiteth: the\\r\\nlonging of over-fulness looketh forth from the smiling heaven of thine\\r\\neyes!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, O my soul! Who could see thy smiling and not melt\\r\\ninto tears? The angels themselves melt into tears through the\\r\\nover-graciousness of thy smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThy graciousness and over-graciousness, is it which will not complain\\r\\nand weep: and yet, O my soul, longeth thy smiling for tears, and thy\\r\\ntrembling mouth for sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is not all weeping complaining? And all complaining, accusing?\" Thus\\r\\nspeakest thou to thyself; and therefore, O my soul, wilt thou rather\\r\\nsmile than pour forth thy grief--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Than in gushing tears pour forth all thy grief concerning thy\\r\\nfulness, and concerning the craving of the vine for the vintager and\\r\\nvintage-knife!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut wilt thou not weep, wilt thou not weep forth thy purple melancholy,\\r\\nthen wilt thou have to SING, O my soul!--Behold, I smile myself, who\\r\\nforetell thee this:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thou wilt have to sing with passionate song, until all seas turn calm\\r\\nto hearken unto thy longing,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Until over calm longing seas the bark glideth, the golden marvel,\\r\\naround the gold of which all good, bad, and marvellous things frisk:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Also many large and small animals, and everything that hath light\\r\\nmarvellous feet, so that it can run on violet-blue paths,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Towards the golden marvel, the spontaneous bark, and its master: he,\\r\\nhowever, is the vintager who waiteth with the diamond vintage-knife,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thy great deliverer, O my soul, the nameless one--for whom future\\r\\nsongs only will find names! And verily, already hath thy breath the\\r\\nfragrance of future songs,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Already glowest thou and dreamest, already drinkest thou thirstily at\\r\\nall deep echoing wells of consolation, already reposeth thy melancholy\\r\\nin the bliss of future songs!--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my soul, now have I given thee all, and even my last possession, and\\r\\nall my hands have become empty by thee:--THAT I BADE THEE SING, behold,\\r\\nthat was my last thing to give!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I bade thee sing,--say now, say: WHICH of us now--oweth thanks?--\\r\\nBetter still, however: sing unto me, sing, O my soul! And let me thank\\r\\nthee!--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLIX. THE SECOND DANCE-SONG.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Into thine eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in thy\\r\\nnight-eyes,--my heart stood still with delight:\\r\\n\\r\\n--A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, drinking,\\r\\nreblinking, golden swing-bark!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my dance-frantic foot, dost thou cast a glance, a laughing,\\r\\nquestioning, melting, thrown glance:\\r\\n\\r\\nTwice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands--then did my\\r\\nfeet swing with dance-fury.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMy heels reared aloft, my toes they hearkened,--thee they would know:\\r\\nhath not the dancer his ear--in his toe!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto thee did I spring: then fledst thou back from my bound; and towards\\r\\nme waved thy fleeing, flying tresses round!\\r\\n\\r\\nAway from thee did I spring, and from thy snaky tresses: then stoodst\\r\\nthou there half-turned, and in thine eye caresses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith crooked glances--dost thou teach me crooked courses; on crooked\\r\\ncourses learn my feet--crafty fancies!\\r\\n\\r\\nI fear thee near, I love thee far; thy flight allureth me, thy seeking\\r\\nsecureth me:--I suffer, but for thee, what would I not gladly bear!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thee, whose coldness inflameth, whose hatred misleadeth, whose\\r\\nflight enchaineth, whose mockery--pleadeth:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who would not hate thee, thou great bindress, inwindress, temptress,\\r\\nseekress, findress! Who would not love thee, thou innocent, impatient,\\r\\nwind-swift, child-eyed sinner!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhither pullest thou me now, thou paragon and tomboy? And now foolest\\r\\nthou me fleeing; thou sweet romp dost annoy!\\r\\n\\r\\nI dance after thee, I follow even faint traces lonely. Where art thou?\\r\\nGive me thy hand! Or thy finger only!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are caves and thickets: we shall go astray!--Halt! Stand still!\\r\\nSeest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray?\\r\\n\\r\\nThou bat! Thou owl! Thou wouldst play me foul? Where are we? From the\\r\\ndogs hast thou learned thus to bark and howl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou gnashest on me sweetly with little white teeth; thine evil eyes\\r\\nshoot out upon me, thy curly little mane from underneath!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a dance over stock and stone: I am the hunter,--wilt thou be my\\r\\nhound, or my chamois anon?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow beside me! And quickly, wickedly springing! Now up! And over!--Alas!\\r\\nI have fallen myself overswinging!\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, see me lying, thou arrogant one, and imploring grace! Gladly would I\\r\\nwalk with thee--in some lovelier place!\\r\\n\\r\\n--In the paths of love, through bushes variegated, quiet, trim! Or there\\r\\nalong the lake, where gold-fishes dance and swim!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art now a-weary? There above are sheep and sun-set stripes: is it\\r\\nnot sweet to sleep--the shepherd pipes?\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art so very weary? I carry thee thither; let just thine arm sink!\\r\\nAnd art thou thirsty--I should have something; but thy mouth would not\\r\\nlike it to drink!--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Oh, that cursed, nimble, supple serpent and lurking-witch! Where art\\r\\nthou gone? But in my face do I feel through thy hand, two spots and red\\r\\nblotches itch!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am verily weary of it, ever thy sheepish shepherd to be. Thou witch,\\r\\nif I have hitherto sung unto thee, now shalt THOU--cry unto me!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the rhythm of my whip shalt thou dance and cry! I forget not my\\r\\nwhip?--Not I!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did Life answer me thus, and kept thereby her fine ears closed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra! Crack not so terribly with thy whip! Thou knowest surely\\r\\nthat noise killeth thought,--and just now there came to me such delicate\\r\\nthoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are both of us genuine ne\\'er-do-wells and ne\\'er-do-ills. Beyond\\r\\ngood and evil found we our island and our green meadow--we two alone!\\r\\nTherefore must we be friendly to each other!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd even should we not love each other from the bottom of our\\r\\nhearts,--must we then have a grudge against each other if we do not love\\r\\neach other perfectly?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that I am friendly to thee, and often too friendly, that knowest\\r\\nthou: and the reason is that I am envious of thy Wisdom. Ah, this mad\\r\\nold fool, Wisdom!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf thy Wisdom should one day run away from thee, ah! then would also my\\r\\nlove run away from thee quickly.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon did Life look thoughtfully behind and around, and said softly:\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra, thou art not faithful enough to me!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou lovest me not nearly so much as thou sayest; I know thou thinkest\\r\\nof soon leaving me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an old heavy, heavy, booming-clock: it boometh by night up to\\r\\nthy cave:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--When thou hearest this clock strike the hours at midnight, then\\r\\nthinkest thou between one and twelve thereon--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thou thinkest thereon, O Zarathustra, I know it--of soon leaving\\r\\nme!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yea,\" answered I, hesitatingly, \"but thou knowest it also\"--And I\\r\\nsaid something into her ear, in amongst her confused, yellow, foolish\\r\\ntresses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou KNOWEST that, O Zarathustra? That knoweth no one--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we gazed at each other, and looked at the green meadow o\\'er which\\r\\nthe cool evening was just passing, and we wept together.--Then, however,\\r\\nwas Life dearer unto me than all my Wisdom had ever been.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne!\\r\\n\\r\\nO man! Take heed!\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat saith deep midnight\\'s voice indeed?\\r\\n\\r\\nThree!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I slept my sleep--\\r\\n\\r\\nFour!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"From deepest dream I\\'ve woke and plead:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFive!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The world is deep,\\r\\n\\r\\nSix!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And deeper than the day could read.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Deep is its woe--\\r\\n\\r\\nEight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Joy--deeper still than grief can be:\\r\\n\\r\\nNine!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Woe saith: Hence!

THE HONEY SACRIFICE.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And again passed moons and years over Zarathustra\\'s soul, and he\\r\\nheeded it not; his hair, however, became white. One day when he sat on\\r\\na stone in front of his cave, and gazed calmly into the distance--one\\r\\nthere gazeth out on the sea, and away beyond sinuous abysses,--then went\\r\\nhis animals thoughtfully round about him, and at last set themselves in\\r\\nfront of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" said they, \"gazest thou out perhaps for thy\\r\\nhappiness?\"--\"Of what account is my happiness!\" answered he, \"I have\\r\\nlong ceased to strive any more for happiness, I strive for my work.\"--\"O\\r\\nZarathustra,\" said the animals once more, \"that sayest thou as one\\r\\nwho hath overmuch of good things. Liest thou not in a sky-blue lake of\\r\\nhappiness?\"--\"Ye wags,\" answered Zarathustra, and smiled, \"how well did\\r\\nye choose the simile! But ye know also that my happiness is heavy, and\\r\\nnot like a fluid wave of water: it presseth me and will not leave me,\\r\\nand is like molten pitch.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThen went his animals again thoughtfully around him, and placed\\r\\nthemselves once more in front of him. \"O Zarathustra,\" said they, \"it is\\r\\nconsequently FOR THAT REASON that thou thyself always becometh yellower\\r\\nand darker, although thy hair looketh white and flaxen? Lo, thou sittest\\r\\nin thy pitch!\"--\"What do ye say, mine animals?\" said Zarathustra,\\r\\nlaughing; \"verily I reviled when I spake of pitch. As it happeneth with\\r\\nme, so is it with all fruits that turn ripe. It is the HONEY in my veins\\r\\nthat maketh my blood thicker, and also my soul stiller.\"--\"So will it\\r\\nbe, O Zarathustra,\" answered his animals, and pressed up to him; \"but\\r\\nwilt thou not to-day ascend a high mountain? The air is pure, and to-day\\r\\none seeth more of the world than ever.\"--\"Yea, mine animals,\" answered\\r\\nhe, \"ye counsel admirably and according to my heart: I will to-day\\r\\nascend a high mountain! But see that honey is there ready to hand,\\r\\nyellow, white, good, ice-cool, golden-comb-honey. For know that when\\r\\naloft I will make the honey-sacrifice.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra, however, was aloft on the summit, he sent his animals\\r\\nhome that had accompanied him, and found that he was now alone:--then he\\r\\nlaughed from the bottom of his heart, looked around him, and spake thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat I spake of sacrifices and honey-sacrifices, it was merely a ruse\\r\\nin talking and verily, a useful folly! Here aloft can I now speak freer\\r\\nthan in front of mountain-caves and anchorites\\' domestic animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat to sacrifice! I squander what is given me, a squanderer with a\\r\\nthousand hands: how could I call that--sacrificing?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I desired honey I only desired bait, and sweet mucus and\\r\\nmucilage, for which even the mouths of growling bears, and strange,\\r\\nsulky, evil birds, water:\\r\\n\\r\\n--The best bait, as huntsmen and fishermen require it. For if the world\\r\\nbe as a gloomy forest of animals, and a pleasure-ground for all wild\\r\\nhuntsmen, it seemeth to me rather--and preferably--a fathomless, rich\\r\\nsea;\\r\\n\\r\\n--A sea full of many-hued fishes and crabs, for which even the Gods\\r\\nmight long, and might be tempted to become fishers in it, and casters of\\r\\nnets,--so rich is the world in wonderful things, great and small!\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially the human world, the human sea:--towards IT do I now throw\\r\\nout my golden angle-rod and say: Open up, thou human abyss!\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen up, and throw unto me thy fish and shining crabs! With my best bait\\r\\nshall I allure to myself to-day the strangest human fish!\\r\\n\\r\\n--My happiness itself do I throw out into all places far and wide \\'twixt\\r\\norient, noontide, and occident, to see if many human fish will not learn\\r\\nto hug and tug at my happiness;--\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil, biting at my sharp hidden hooks, they have to come up unto MY\\r\\nheight, the motleyest abyss-groundlings, to the wickedest of all fishers\\r\\nof men.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor THIS am I from the heart and from the beginning--drawing,\\r\\nhither-drawing, upward-drawing, upbringing; a drawer, a trainer, a\\r\\ntraining-master, who not in vain counselled himself once on a time:\\r\\n\"Become what thou art!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus may men now come UP to me; for as yet do I await the signs that it\\r\\nis time for my down-going; as yet do I not myself go down, as I must do,\\r\\namongst men.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore do I here wait, crafty and scornful upon high mountains,\\r\\nno impatient one, no patient one; rather one who hath even unlearnt\\r\\npatience,--because he no longer \"suffereth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my fate giveth me time: it hath forgotten me perhaps? Or doth it sit\\r\\nbehind a big stone and catch flies?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, I am well-disposed to mine eternal fate, because it doth not\\r\\nhound and hurry me, but leaveth me time for merriment and mischief; so\\r\\nthat I have to-day ascended this high mountain to catch fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid ever any one catch fish upon high mountains? And though it be a\\r\\nfolly what I here seek and do, it is better so than that down below I\\r\\nshould become solemn with waiting, and green and yellow--\\r\\n\\r\\n--A posturing wrath-snorter with waiting, a holy howl-storm from\\r\\nthe mountains, an impatient one that shouteth down into the valleys:\\r\\n\"Hearken, else I will scourge you with the scourge of God!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot that I would have a grudge against such wrathful ones on that\\r\\naccount: they are well enough for laughter to me! Impatient must they\\r\\nnow be, those big alarm-drums, which find a voice now or never!\\r\\n\\r\\nMyself, however, and my fate--we do not talk to the Present, neither\\r\\ndo we talk to the Never: for talking we have patience and time and more\\r\\nthan time. For one day must it yet come, and may not pass by.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat must one day come and may not pass by? Our great Hazar, that is\\r\\nto say, our great, remote human-kingdom, the Zarathustra-kingdom of a\\r\\nthousand years--\\r\\n\\r\\nHow remote may such \"remoteness\" be? What doth it concern me? But on\\r\\nthat account it is none the less sure unto me--, with both feet stand I\\r\\nsecure on this ground;\\r\\n\\r\\n--On an eternal ground, on hard primary rock, on this highest, hardest,\\r\\nprimary mountain-ridge, unto which all winds come, as unto the\\r\\nstorm-parting, asking Where? and Whence? and Whither?\\r\\n\\r\\nHere laugh, laugh, my hearty, healthy wickedness! From high mountains\\r\\ncast down thy glittering scorn-laughter! Allure for me with thy\\r\\nglittering the finest human fish!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whatever belongeth unto ME in all seas, my in-and-for-me in all\\r\\nthings--fish THAT out for me, bring THAT up to me: for that do I wait,\\r\\nthe wickedest of all fish-catchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut! out! my fishing-hook! In and down, thou bait of my happiness! Drip\\r\\nthy sweetest dew, thou honey of my heart! Bite, my fishing-hook, into\\r\\nthe belly of all black affliction!\\r\\n\\r\\nLook out, look out, mine eye! Oh, how many seas round about me, what\\r\\ndawning human futures! And above me--what rosy red stillness! What\\r\\nunclouded silence!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXII. THE CRY OF DISTRESS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day sat Zarathustra again on the stone in front of his cave,\\r\\nwhilst his animals roved about in the world outside to bring home new\\r\\nfood,--also new honey: for Zarathustra had spent and wasted the old\\r\\nhoney to the very last particle. When he thus sat, however, with a\\r\\nstick in his hand, tracing the shadow of his figure on the earth, and\\r\\nreflecting--verily! not upon himself and his shadow,--all at once he\\r\\nstartled and shrank back: for he saw another shadow beside his own.\\r\\nAnd when he hastily looked around and stood up, behold, there stood the\\r\\nsoothsayer beside him, the same whom he had once given to eat and drink\\r\\nat his table, the proclaimer of the great weariness, who taught: \"All is\\r\\nalike, nothing is worth while, the world is without meaning, knowledge\\r\\nstrangleth.\" But his face had changed since then; and when Zarathustra\\r\\nlooked into his eyes, his heart was startled once more: so much evil\\r\\nannouncement and ashy-grey lightnings passed over that countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soothsayer, who had perceived what went on in Zarathustra\\'s soul,\\r\\nwiped his face with his hand, as if he would wipe out the impression;\\r\\nthe same did also Zarathustra. And when both of them had thus silently\\r\\ncomposed and strengthened themselves, they gave each other the hand, as\\r\\na token that they wanted once more to recognise each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Welcome hither,\" said Zarathustra, \"thou soothsayer of the great\\r\\nweariness, not in vain shalt thou once have been my messmate and guest.\\r\\nEat and drink also with me to-day, and forgive it that a cheerful old\\r\\nman sitteth with thee at table!\"--\"A cheerful old man?\" answered the\\r\\nsoothsayer, shaking his head, \"but whoever thou art, or wouldst be, O\\r\\nZarathustra, thou hast been here aloft the longest time,--in a little\\r\\nwhile thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land!\"--\"Do I then rest\\r\\non dry land?\"--asked Zarathustra, laughing.--\"The waves around thy\\r\\nmountain,\" answered the soothsayer, \"rise and rise, the waves of great\\r\\ndistress and affliction: they will soon raise thy bark also and carry\\r\\nthee away.\"--Thereupon was Zarathustra silent and wondered.--\"Dost thou\\r\\nstill hear nothing?\" continued the soothsayer: \"doth it not rush and\\r\\nroar out of the depth?\"--Zarathustra was silent once more and listened:\\r\\nthen heard he a long, long cry, which the abysses threw to one another\\r\\nand passed on; for none of them wished to retain it: so evil did it\\r\\nsound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou ill announcer,\" said Zarathustra at last, \"that is a cry of\\r\\ndistress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of a black sea.\\r\\nBut what doth human distress matter to me! My last sin which hath been\\r\\nreserved for me,--knowest thou what it is called?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"PITY!\" answered the soothsayer from an overflowing heart, and raised\\r\\nboth his hands aloft--\"O Zarathustra, I have come that I may seduce thee\\r\\nto thy last sin!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd hardly had those words been uttered when there sounded the cry\\r\\nonce more, and longer and more alarming than before--also much nearer.\\r\\n\"Hearest thou? Hearest thou, O Zarathustra?\" called out the soothsayer,\\r\\n\"the cry concerneth thee, it calleth thee: Come, come, come; it is time,\\r\\nit is the highest time!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra was silent thereupon, confused and staggered; at last he\\r\\nasked, like one who hesitateth in himself: \"And who is it that there\\r\\ncalleth me?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But thou knowest it, certainly,\" answered the soothsayer warmly, \"why\\r\\ndost thou conceal thyself? It is THE HIGHER MAN that crieth for thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The higher man?\" cried Zarathustra, horror-stricken: \"what wanteth HE?\\r\\nWhat wanteth HE? The higher man! What wanteth he here?\"--and his skin\\r\\ncovered with perspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustra\\'s alarm, but listened\\r\\nand listened in the downward direction. When, however, it had been still\\r\\nthere for a long while, he looked behind, and saw Zarathustra standing\\r\\ntrembling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" he began, with sorrowful voice, \"thou dost not stand\\r\\nthere like one whose happiness maketh him giddy: thou wilt have to dance\\r\\nlest thou tumble down!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy side-leaps,\\r\\nno one may say unto me: \\'Behold, here danceth the last joyous man!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain would any one come to this height who sought HIM here: caves\\r\\nwould he find, indeed, and back-caves, hiding-places for hidden ones;\\r\\nbut not lucky mines, nor treasure-chambers, nor new gold-veins of\\r\\nhappiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHappiness--how indeed could one find happiness among such buried-alive\\r\\nand solitary ones! Must I yet seek the last happiness on the Happy\\r\\nIsles, and far away among forgotten seas?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of service,\\r\\nthere are no longer any Happy Isles!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sighed the soothsayer; with his last sigh, however, Zarathustra\\r\\nagain became serene and assured, like one who hath come out of a deep\\r\\nchasm into the light. \"Nay! Nay! Three times Nay!\" exclaimed he with a\\r\\nstrong voice, and stroked his beard--\"THAT do I know better! There are\\r\\nstill Happy Isles! Silence THEREON, thou sighing sorrow-sack!\\r\\n\\r\\nCease to splash THEREON, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! Do I not\\r\\nalready stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched like a dog?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may again become\\r\\ndry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem to thee discourteous?\\r\\nHere however is MY court.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at once in those\\r\\nforests: FROM THENCE came his cry. Perhaps he is there hard beset by an\\r\\nevil beast.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is in MY domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And verily, there\\r\\nare many evil beasts about me.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. Then said the\\r\\nsoothsayer: \"O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue!\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather wouldst thou run\\r\\ninto the forest and lay snares for evil beasts!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what good will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have me again:\\r\\nin thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a block--and wait\\r\\nfor thee!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So be it!\" shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: \"and what is mine\\r\\nin my cave belongeth also unto thee, my guest!\\r\\n\\r\\nShouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it up, thou\\r\\ngrowling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the evening we want both to\\r\\nbe in good spirits;\\r\\n\\r\\n--In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to an end! And\\r\\nthou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing-bear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! Cheer up, old\\r\\nbear! But I also--am a soothsayer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXIII. TALK WITH THE KINGS.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the mountains and\\r\\nforests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right on the path\\r\\nwhich he was about to descend came two kings walking, bedecked with\\r\\ncrowns and purple girdles, and variegated like flamingoes: they drove\\r\\nbefore them a laden ass. \"What do these kings want in my domain?\" said\\r\\nZarathustra in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind\\r\\na thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said half-aloud,\\r\\nlike one speaking only to himself: \"Strange! Strange! How doth this\\r\\nharmonise? Two kings do I see--and only one ass!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and looked towards the\\r\\nspot whence the voice proceeded, and afterwards looked into each other\\'s\\r\\nfaces. \"Such things do we also think among ourselves,\" said the king on\\r\\nthe right, \"but we do not utter them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and answered:\\r\\n\"That may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite who hath lived too\\r\\nlong among rocks and trees. For no society at all spoileth also good\\r\\nmanners.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good manners?\" replied angrily and bitterly the other king: \"what\\r\\nthen do we run out of the way of? Is it not \\'good manners\\'? Our \\'good\\r\\nsociety\\'?\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter, verily, to live among anchorites and goat-herds, than with\\r\\nour gilded, false, over-rouged populace--though it call itself \\'good\\r\\nsociety.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n--Though it call itself \\'nobility.\\' But there all is false and foul,\\r\\nabove all the blood--thanks to old evil diseases and worse curers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant, coarse,\\r\\nartful, obstinate and enduring: that is at present the noblest type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peasant is at present the best; and the peasant type should be\\r\\nmaster! But it is the kingdom of the populace--I no longer allow\\r\\nanything to be imposed upon me. The populace, however--that meaneth,\\r\\nhodgepodge.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with everything, saint\\r\\nand swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every beast out of Noah\\'s ark.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No one knoweth any\\r\\nlonger how to reverence: it is THAT precisely that we run away from.\\r\\nThey are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they gild palm-leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have become false,\\r\\ndraped and disguised with the old faded pomp of our ancestors,\\r\\nshow-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and whosoever at present\\r\\ntrafficketh for power.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ARE NOT the first men--and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of\\r\\nthis imposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those bawlers and\\r\\nscribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambition-fidgeting, the\\r\\nbad breath--: fie, to live among the rabble;\\r\\n\\r\\n--Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, loathing!\\r\\nLoathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about us kings!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thine old sickness seizeth thee,\" said here the king on the left, \"thy\\r\\nloathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou knowest, however, that some\\r\\none heareth us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears and eyes to this\\r\\ntalk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced towards the kings, and thus\\r\\nbegan:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth unto you, is\\r\\ncalled Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am Zarathustra who once said: \\'What doth it now matter about kings!\\'\\r\\nForgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each other: \\'What doth it matter\\r\\nabout us kings!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, however, is MY domain and jurisdiction: what may ye be seeking in\\r\\nmy domain? Perhaps, however, ye have FOUND on your way what _I_ seek:\\r\\nnamely, the higher man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and said with\\r\\none voice: \"We are recognised!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest darkness of\\r\\nour hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for lo! we are on our way\\r\\nto find the higher man--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. To him do we\\r\\nconvey this ass. For the highest man shall also be the highest lord on\\r\\nearth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than when the mighty\\r\\nof the earth are not also the first men. Then everything becometh false\\r\\nand distorted and monstrous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when they are even the last men, and more beast than man, then\\r\\nriseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last saith even the\\r\\npopulace-virtue: \\'Lo, I alone am virtue!\\'\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wisdom in kings! I\\r\\nam enchanted, and verily, I have already promptings to make a rhyme\\r\\nthereon:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for every one\\'s\\r\\nears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration for long ears. Well\\r\\nthen! Well now!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utterance: it said\\r\\ndistinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Twas once--methinks year one of our blessed Lord,--Drunk without wine,\\r\\nthe Sybil thus deplored:--\"How ill things go! Decline! Decline! Ne\\'er\\r\\nsank the world so low! Rome now hath turned harlot and harlot-stew,\\r\\nRome\\'s Caesar a beast, and God--hath turned Jew!\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith those rhymes of Zarathustra the kings were delighted; the king on\\r\\nthe right, however, said: \"O Zarathustra, how well it was that we set\\r\\nout to see thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror: there lookedst\\r\\nthou with the grimace of a devil, and sneeringly: so that we were afraid\\r\\nof thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what good did it do! Always didst thou prick us anew in heart and\\r\\near with thy sayings. Then did we say at last: What doth it matter how\\r\\nhe look!\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must HEAR him; him who teacheth: \\'Ye shall love peace as a means to\\r\\nnew wars, and the short peace more than the long!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one ever spake such warlike words: \\'What is good? To be brave is\\r\\ngood. It is the good war that halloweth every cause.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, our fathers\\' blood stirred in our veins at such words: it\\r\\nwas like the voice of spring to old wine-casks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the swords ran among one another like red-spotted serpents, then\\r\\ndid our fathers become fond of life; the sun of every peace seemed to\\r\\nthem languid and lukewarm, the long peace, however, made them ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow they sighed, our fathers, when they saw on the wall brightly\\r\\nfurbished, dried-up swords! Like those they thirsted for war. For a\\r\\nsword thirsteth to drink blood, and sparkleth with desire.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--When the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the happiness of\\r\\ntheir fathers, there came upon Zarathustra no little desire to mock at\\r\\ntheir eagerness: for evidently they were very peaceable kings whom he\\r\\nsaw before him, kings with old and refined features. But he restrained\\r\\nhimself. \"Well!\" said he, \"thither leadeth the way, there lieth the\\r\\ncave of Zarathustra; and this day is to have a long evening! At present,\\r\\nhowever, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it: but, to be\\r\\nsure, ye will have to wait long!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! What of that! Where doth one at present learn better to wait\\r\\nthan at courts? And the whole virtue of kings that hath remained unto\\r\\nthem--is it not called to-day: ABILITY to wait?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXIV. THE LEECH.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower down, through\\r\\nforests and past moory bottoms; as it happeneth, however, to every one\\r\\nwho meditateth upon hard matters, he trod thereby unawares upon a man.\\r\\nAnd lo, there spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain, and two\\r\\ncurses and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his\\r\\nstick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, however,\\r\\nhe regained his composure, and his heart laughed at the folly he had\\r\\njust committed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Pardon me,\" said he to the trodden one, who had got up enraged, and had\\r\\nseated himself, \"pardon me, and hear first of all a parable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lonesome highway,\\r\\nrunneth unawares against a sleeping dog, a dog which lieth in the sun:\\r\\n\\r\\n--As both of them then start up and snap at each other, like deadly\\r\\nenemies, those two beings mortally frightened--so did it happen unto us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet! And yet--how little was lacking for them to caress each other,\\r\\nthat dog and that lonesome one! Are they not both--lonesome ones!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Whoever thou art,\" said the trodden one, still enraged, \"thou\\r\\ntreadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only with thy foot!\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! am I then a dog?\"--And thereupon the sitting one got up, and pulled\\r\\nhis naked arm out of the swamp. For at first he had lain outstretched\\r\\non the ground, hidden and indiscernible, like those who lie in wait for\\r\\nswamp-game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But whatever art thou about!\" called out Zarathustra in alarm, for he\\r\\nsaw a deal of blood streaming over the naked arm,--\"what hath hurt thee?\\r\\nHath an evil beast bit thee, thou unfortunate one?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bleeding one laughed, still angry, \"What matter is it to thee!\" said\\r\\nhe, and was about to go on. \"Here am I at home and in my province.\\r\\nLet him question me whoever will: to a dolt, however, I shall hardly\\r\\nanswer.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art mistaken,\" said Zarathustra sympathetically, and held him\\r\\nfast; \"thou art mistaken. Here thou art not at home, but in my domain,\\r\\nand therein shall no one receive any hurt.\\r\\n\\r\\nCall me however what thou wilt--I am who I must be. I call myself\\r\\nZarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! Up thither is the way to Zarathustra\\'s cave: it is not far,--wilt\\r\\nthou not attend to thy wounds at my home?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt hath gone badly with thee, thou unfortunate one, in this life: first\\r\\na beast bit thee, and then--a man trod upon thee!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen however the trodden one had heard the name of Zarathustra he was\\r\\ntransformed. \"What happeneth unto me!\" he exclaimed, \"WHO preoccupieth\\r\\nme so much in this life as this one man, namely Zarathustra, and that\\r\\none animal that liveth on blood, the leech?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the sake of the leech did I lie here by this swamp, like a fisher,\\r\\nand already had mine outstretched arm been bitten ten times, when there\\r\\nbiteth a still finer leech at my blood, Zarathustra himself!\\r\\n\\r\\nO happiness! O miracle! Praised be this day which enticed me into the\\r\\nswamp! Praised be the best, the livest cupping-glass, that at present\\r\\nliveth; praised be the great conscience-leech Zarathustra!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the trodden one, and Zarathustra rejoiced at his words and\\r\\ntheir refined reverential style. \"Who art thou?\" asked he, and gave\\r\\nhim his hand, \"there is much to clear up and elucidate between us, but\\r\\nalready methinketh pure clear day is dawning.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am THE SPIRITUALLY CONSCIENTIOUS ONE,\" answered he who was asked,\\r\\n\"and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one to take it\\r\\nmore rigorously, more restrictedly, and more severely than I, except him\\r\\nfrom whom I learnt it, Zarathustra himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter know nothing than half-know many things! Better be a fool on\\r\\none\\'s own account, than a sage on other people\\'s approbation! I--go to\\r\\nthe basis:\\r\\n\\r\\n--What matter if it be great or small? If it be called swamp or sky?\\r\\nA handbreadth of basis is enough for me, if it be actually basis and\\r\\nground!\\r\\n\\r\\n--A handbreadth of basis: thereon can one stand. In the true\\r\\nknowing-knowledge there is nothing great and nothing small.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech?\" asked Zarathustra; \"and\\r\\nthou investigatest the leech to its ultimate basis, thou conscientious\\r\\none?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" answered the trodden one, \"that would be something\\r\\nimmense; how could I presume to do so!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat, however, of which I am master and knower, is the BRAIN of the\\r\\nleech:--that is MY world!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is also a world! Forgive it, however, that my pride here findeth\\r\\nexpression, for here I have not mine equal. Therefore said I: \\'here am I\\r\\nat home.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long have I investigated this one thing, the brain of the leech, so\\r\\nthat here the slippery truth might no longer slip from me! Here is MY\\r\\ndomain!\\r\\n\\r\\n--For the sake of this did I cast everything else aside, for the sake of\\r\\nthis did everything else become indifferent to me; and close beside my\\r\\nknowledge lieth my black ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should be so--that I\\r\\nshould know one thing, and not know all else: they are a loathing unto\\r\\nme, all the semi-spiritual, all the hazy, hovering, and visionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere mine honesty ceaseth, there am I blind, and want also to be blind.\\r\\nWhere I want to know, however, there want I also to be honest--namely,\\r\\nsevere, rigorous, restricted, cruel and inexorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause THOU once saidest, O Zarathustra: \\'Spirit is life which itself\\r\\ncutteth into life\\';--that led and allured me to thy doctrine. And\\r\\nverily, with mine own blood have I increased mine own knowledge!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"As the evidence indicateth,\" broke in Zarathustra; for still was the\\r\\nblood flowing down on the naked arm of the conscientious one. For there\\r\\nhad ten leeches bitten into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O thou strange fellow, how much doth this very evidence teach\\r\\nme--namely, thou thyself! And not all, perhaps, might I pour into thy\\r\\nrigorous ear!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell then! We part here! But I would fain find thee again. Up thither is\\r\\nthe way to my cave: to-night shalt thou there be my welcome guest!\\r\\n\\r\\nFain would I also make amends to thy body for Zarathustra treading upon\\r\\nthee with his feet: I think about that. Just now, however, a cry of\\r\\ndistress calleth me hastily away from thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXV. THE MAGICIAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw he on the same\\r\\npath, not far below him, a man who threw his limbs about like a maniac,\\r\\nand at last tumbled to the ground on his belly. \"Halt!\" said then\\r\\nZarathustra to his heart, \"he there must surely be the higher man, from\\r\\nhim came that dreadful cry of distress,--I will see if I can help him.\"\\r\\nWhen, however, he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground,\\r\\nhe found a trembling old man, with fixed eyes; and in spite of all\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s efforts to lift him and set him again on his feet, it was\\r\\nall in vain. The unfortunate one, also, did not seem to notice that some\\r\\none was beside him; on the contrary, he continually looked around with\\r\\nmoving gestures, like one forsaken and isolated from all the world.\\r\\nAt last, however, after much trembling, and convulsion, and\\r\\ncurling-himself-up, he began to lament thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n     Who warm\\'th me, who lov\\'th me still?\\r\\n     Give ardent fingers!\\r\\n     Give heartening charcoal-warmers!\\r\\n     Prone, outstretched, trembling,\\r\\n     Like him, half dead and cold, whose feet one warm\\'th--\\r\\n     And shaken, ah! by unfamiliar fevers,\\r\\n     Shivering with sharpened, icy-cold frost-arrows,\\r\\n     By thee pursued, my fancy!\\r\\n     Ineffable!  Recondite!  Sore-frightening!\\r\\n     Thou huntsman \\'hind the cloud-banks!\\r\\n     Now lightning-struck by thee,\\r\\n     Thou mocking eye that me in darkness watcheth:\\r\\n     --Thus do I lie,\\r\\n     Bend myself, twist myself, convulsed\\r\\n     With all eternal torture,\\r\\n     And smitten\\r\\n     By thee, cruellest huntsman,\\r\\n     Thou unfamiliar--GOD...\\r\\n\\r\\n     Smite deeper!\\r\\n     Smite yet once more!\\r\\n     Pierce through and rend my heart!\\r\\n     What mean\\'th this torture\\r\\n     With dull, indented arrows?\\r\\n     Why look\\'st thou hither,\\r\\n     Of human pain not weary,\\r\\n     With mischief-loving, godly flash-glances?\\r\\n     Not murder wilt thou,\\r\\n     But torture, torture?\\r\\n     For why--ME torture,\\r\\n     Thou mischief-loving, unfamiliar God?--\\r\\n\\r\\n     Ha!  Ha!\\r\\n     Thou stealest nigh\\r\\n     In midnight\\'s gloomy hour?...\\r\\n     What wilt thou?\\r\\n     Speak!\\r\\n     Thou crowdst me, pressest--\\r\\n     Ha! now far too closely!\\r\\n     Thou hearst me breathing,\\r\\n     Thou o\\'erhearst my heart,\\r\\n     Thou ever jealous one!\\r\\n     --Of what, pray, ever jealous?\\r\\n     Off!  Off!\\r\\n     For why the ladder?\\r\\n     Wouldst thou GET IN?\\r\\n     To heart in-clamber?\\r\\n     To mine own secretest\\r\\n     Conceptions in-clamber?\\r\\n     Shameless one!  Thou unknown one!--Thief!\\r\\n     What seekst thou by thy stealing?\\r\\n     What seekst thou by thy hearkening?\\r\\n     What seekst thou by thy torturing?\\r\\n     Thou torturer!\\r\\n     Thou--hangman-God!\\r\\n     Or shall I, as the mastiffs do,\\r\\n     Roll me before thee?\\r\\n     And cringing, enraptured, frantical,\\r\\n     My tail friendly--waggle!\\r\\n\\r\\n     In vain!\\r\\n     Goad further!\\r\\n     Cruellest goader!\\r\\n     No dog--thy game just am I,\\r\\n     Cruellest huntsman!\\r\\n     Thy proudest of captives,\\r\\n     Thou robber \\'hind the cloud-banks...\\r\\n     Speak finally!\\r\\n     Thou lightning-veiled one!  Thou unknown one!  Speak!\\r\\n     What wilt thou, highway-ambusher, from--ME?\\r\\n     What WILT thou, unfamiliar--God?\\r\\n     What?\\r\\n     Ransom-gold?\\r\\n     How much of ransom-gold?\\r\\n     Solicit much--that bid\\'th my pride!\\r\\n     And be concise--that bid\\'th mine other pride!\\r\\n\\r\\n     Ha!  Ha!\\r\\n     ME--wantst thou?  me?\\r\\n     --Entire?...\\r\\n\\r\\n     Ha!  Ha!\\r\\n     And torturest me, fool that thou art,\\r\\n     Dead-torturest quite my pride?\\r\\n     Give LOVE to me--who warm\\'th me still?\\r\\n     Who lov\\'th me still?--\\r\\n     Give ardent fingers\\r\\n     Give heartening charcoal-warmers,\\r\\n     Give me, the lonesomest,\\r\\n     The ice (ah! seven-fold frozen ice\\r\\n     For very enemies,\\r\\n     For foes, doth make one thirst).\\r\\n     Give, yield to me,\\r\\n     Cruellest foe,\\r\\n     --THYSELF!--\\r\\n\\r\\n     Away!\\r\\n     There fled he surely,\\r\\n     My final, only comrade,\\r\\n     My greatest foe,\\r\\n     Mine unfamiliar--\\r\\n     My hangman-God!...\\r\\n\\r\\n     --Nay!\\r\\n     Come thou back!\\r\\n     WITH all of thy great tortures!\\r\\n     To me the last of lonesome ones,\\r\\n     Oh, come thou back!\\r\\n     All my hot tears in streamlets trickle\\r\\n     Their course to thee!\\r\\n     And all my final hearty fervour--\\r\\n     Up-glow\\'th to THEE!\\r\\n     Oh, come thou back,\\r\\n     Mine unfamiliar God! my PAIN!\\r\\n     My final bliss!\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Here, however, Zarathustra could no longer restrain himself; he took\\r\\nhis staff and struck the wailer with all his might. \"Stop this,\" cried\\r\\nhe to him with wrathful laughter, \"stop this, thou stage-player! Thou\\r\\nfalse coiner! Thou liar from the very heart! I know thee well!\\r\\n\\r\\nI will soon make warm legs to thee, thou evil magician: I know well\\r\\nhow--to make it hot for such as thou!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Leave off,\" said the old man, and sprang up from the ground, \"strike\\r\\nme no more, O Zarathustra! I did it only for amusement!\\r\\n\\r\\nThat kind of thing belongeth to mine art. Thee thyself, I wanted to put\\r\\nto the proof when I gave this performance. And verily, thou hast well\\r\\ndetected me!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou thyself--hast given me no small proof of thyself: thou art\\r\\nHARD, thou wise Zarathustra! Hard strikest thou with thy \\'truths,\\' thy\\r\\ncudgel forceth from me--THIS truth!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Flatter not,\" answered Zarathustra, still excited and frowning,\\r\\n\"thou stage-player from the heart! Thou art false: why speakest thou--of\\r\\ntruth!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou peacock of peacocks, thou sea of vanity; WHAT didst thou represent\\r\\nbefore me, thou evil magician; WHOM was I meant to believe in when thou\\r\\nwailedst in such wise?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE PENITENT IN SPIRIT,\" said the old man, \"it was him--I represented;\\r\\nthou thyself once devisedst this expression--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The poet and magician who at last turneth his spirit against himself,\\r\\nthe transformed one who freezeth to death by his bad science and\\r\\nconscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just acknowledge it: it was long, O Zarathustra, before thou\\r\\ndiscoveredst my trick and lie! Thou BELIEVEDST in my distress when thou\\r\\nheldest my head with both thy hands,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--I heard thee lament \\'we have loved him too little, loved him too\\r\\nlittle!\\' Because I so far deceived thee, my wickedness rejoiced in me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou mayest have deceived subtler ones than I,\" said Zarathustra\\r\\nsternly. \"I am not on my guard against deceivers; I HAVE TO BE without\\r\\nprecaution: so willeth my lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou, however,--MUST deceive: so far do I know thee! Thou must ever be\\r\\nequivocal, trivocal, quadrivocal, and quinquivocal! Even what thou hast\\r\\nnow confessed, is not nearly true enough nor false enough for me!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou bad false coiner, how couldst thou do otherwise! Thy very malady\\r\\nwouldst thou whitewash if thou showed thyself naked to thy physician.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus didst thou whitewash thy lie before me when thou saidst: \\'I did\\r\\nso ONLY for amusement!\\' There was also SERIOUSNESS therein, thou ART\\r\\nsomething of a penitent-in-spirit!\\r\\n\\r\\nI divine thee well: thou hast become the enchanter of all the world; but\\r\\nfor thyself thou hast no lie or artifice left,--thou art disenchanted to\\r\\nthyself!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast reaped disgust as thy one truth. No word in thee is any longer\\r\\ngenuine, but thy mouth is so: that is to say, the disgust that cleaveth\\r\\nunto thy mouth.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Who art thou at all!\" cried here the old magician with defiant voice,\\r\\n\"who dareth to speak thus unto ME, the greatest man now living?\"--and a\\r\\ngreen flash shot from his eye at Zarathustra. But immediately after he\\r\\nchanged, and said sadly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra, I am weary of it, I am disgusted with mine arts, I am\\r\\nnot GREAT, why do I dissemble! But thou knowest it well--I sought for\\r\\ngreatness!\\r\\n\\r\\nA great man I wanted to appear, and persuaded many; but the lie hath\\r\\nbeen beyond my power. On it do I collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, everything is a lie in me; but that I collapse--this my\\r\\ncollapsing is GENUINE!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It honoureth thee,\" said Zarathustra gloomily, looking down with\\r\\nsidelong glance, \"it honoureth thee that thou soughtest for greatness,\\r\\nbut it betrayeth thee also. Thou art not great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou bad old magician, THAT is the best and the honestest thing I honour\\r\\nin thee, that thou hast become weary of thyself, and hast expressed it:\\r\\n\\'I am not great.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEREIN do I honour thee as a penitent-in-spirit, and although only for\\r\\nthe twinkling of an eye, in that one moment wast thou--genuine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut tell me, what seekest thou here in MY forests and rocks? And if thou\\r\\nhast put thyself in MY way, what proof of me wouldst thou have?--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Wherein didst thou put ME to the test?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and his eyes sparkled. But the old magician kept\\r\\nsilence for a while; then said he: \"Did I put thee to the test? I--seek\\r\\nonly.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Zarathustra, I seek a genuine one, a right one, a simple one, an\\r\\nunequivocal one, a man of perfect honesty, a vessel of wisdom, a saint\\r\\nof knowledge, a great man!\\r\\n\\r\\nKnowest thou it not, O Zarathustra? I SEEK ZARATHUSTRA.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--And here there arose a long silence between them: Zarathustra,\\r\\nhowever, became profoundly absorbed in thought, so that he shut his\\r\\neyes. But afterwards coming back to the situation, he grasped the hand\\r\\nof the magician, and said, full of politeness and policy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well! Up thither leadeth the way, there is the cave of Zarathustra. In\\r\\nit mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst fain find.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd ask counsel of mine animals, mine eagle and my serpent: they shall\\r\\nhelp thee to seek. My cave however is large.\\r\\n\\r\\nI myself, to be sure--I have as yet seen no great man. That which is\\r\\ngreat, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It is the kingdom\\r\\nof the populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a one have I found who stretched and inflated himself, and the\\r\\npeople cried: \\'Behold; a great man!\\' But what good do all bellows do!\\r\\nThe wind cometh out at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long: then\\r\\ncometh out the wind. To prick a swollen one in the belly, I call good\\r\\npastime. Hear that, ye boys!\\r\\n\\r\\nOur to-day is of the populace: who still KNOWETH what is great and what\\r\\nis small! Who could there seek successfully for greatness! A fool only:\\r\\nit succeedeth with fools.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who TAUGHT that to thee?\\r\\nIs to-day the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why dost thou--tempt\\r\\nme?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went laughing on his\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXVI. OUT OF SERVICE.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long, however, after Zarathustra had freed himself from the\\r\\nmagician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path which he\\r\\nfollowed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, pale countenance:\\r\\nTHIS MAN grieved him exceedingly. \"Alas,\" said he to his heart, \"there\\r\\nsitteth disguised affliction; methinketh he is of the type of the\\r\\npriests: what do THEY want in my domain?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must another\\r\\nnecromancer again run across my path,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Some sorcerer with laying-on-of-hands, some sombre wonder-worker by\\r\\nthe grace of God, some anointed world-maligner, whom, may the devil\\r\\ntake!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the devil is never at the place which would be his right place: he\\r\\nalways cometh too late, that cursed dwarf and club-foot!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart, and considered how\\r\\nwith averted look he might slip past the black man. But behold, it came\\r\\nabout otherwise. For at the same moment had the sitting one already\\r\\nperceived him; and not unlike one whom an unexpected happiness\\r\\novertaketh, he sprang to his feet, and went straight towards\\r\\nZarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whoever thou art, thou traveller,\" said he, \"help a strayed one, a\\r\\nseeker, an old man, who may here easily come to grief!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world here is strange to me, and remote; wild beasts also did I hear\\r\\nhowling; and he who could have given me protection--he is himself no\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seeking the pious man, a saint and an anchorite, who, alone in his\\r\\nforest, had not yet heard of what all the world knoweth at present.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"WHAT doth all the world know at present?\" asked Zarathustra. \"Perhaps\\r\\nthat the old God no longer liveth, in whom all the world once believed?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou sayest it,\" answered the old man sorrowfully. \"And I served that\\r\\nold God until his last hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet not free;\\r\\nlikewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, except it be in\\r\\nrecollections.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might finally have\\r\\na festival for myself once more, as becometh an old pope and\\r\\nchurch-father: for know it, that I am the last pope!--a festival of\\r\\npious recollections and divine services.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, the saint in\\r\\nthe forest, who praised his God constantly with singing and mumbling.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe himself found I no longer when I found his cot--but two wolves found\\r\\nI therein, which howled on account of his death,--for all animals loved\\r\\nhim. Then did I haste away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? Then did my\\r\\nheart determine that I should seek another, the most pious of all\\r\\nthose who believe not in God--, my heart determined that I should seek\\r\\nZarathustra!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him who stood\\r\\nbefore him. Zarathustra however seized the hand of the old pope and\\r\\nregarded it a long while with admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lo! thou venerable one,\" said he then, \"what a fine and long hand! That\\r\\nis the hand of one who hath ever dispensed blessings. Now, however, doth\\r\\nit hold fast him whom thou seekest, me, Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: \\'Who is ungodlier than I,\\r\\nthat I may enjoy his teaching?\\'\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances the thoughts and\\r\\narrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the latter began:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost him most--:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? But who\\r\\ncould rejoice at that!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Thou servedst him to the last?\" asked Zarathustra thoughtfully, after\\r\\na deep silence, \"thou knowest HOW he died? Is it true what they say,\\r\\nthat sympathy choked him;\\r\\n\\r\\n--That he saw how MAN hung on the cross, and could not endure it;--that\\r\\nhis love to man became his hell, and at last his death?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old pope however did not answer, but looked aside timidly, with a\\r\\npainful and gloomy expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him go,\" said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, still\\r\\nlooking the old man straight in the eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that thou speakest\\r\\nonly in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest as well as I WHO he\\r\\nwas, and that he went curious ways.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To speak before three eyes,\" said the old pope cheerfully (he was blind\\r\\nof one eye), \"in divine matters I am more enlightened than Zarathustra\\r\\nhimself--and may well be so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy love served him long years, my will followed all his will. A good\\r\\nservant, however, knoweth everything, and many a thing even which a\\r\\nmaster hideth from himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not come by his\\r\\nson otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of his faith standeth\\r\\nadultery.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think highly enough of\\r\\nlove itself. Did not that God want also to be judge? But the loving one\\r\\nloveth irrespective of reward and requital.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was he harsh and\\r\\nrevengeful, and built himself a hell for the delight of his favourites.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and pitiful,\\r\\nmore like a grandfather than a father, but most like a tottering old\\r\\ngrandmother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere did he sit shrivelled in his chimney-corner, fretting on account\\r\\nof his weak legs, world-weary, will-weary, and one day he suffocated of\\r\\nhis all-too-great pity.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou old pope,\" said here Zarathustra interposing, \"hast thou seen THAT\\r\\nwith thine eyes? It could well have happened in that way: in that way,\\r\\nAND also otherwise. When Gods die they always die many kinds of death.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! At all events, one way or other--he is gone! He was counter to the\\r\\ntaste of mine ears and eyes; worse than that I should not like to say\\r\\nagainst him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly. But\\r\\nhe--thou knowest it, forsooth, thou old priest, there was something of\\r\\nthy type in him, the priest-type--he was equivocal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was also indistinct. How he raged at us, this wrath-snorter, because\\r\\nwe understood him badly! But why did he not speak more clearly?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if the fault lay in our ears, why did he give us ears that heard him\\r\\nbadly? If there was dirt in our ears, well! who put it in them?\\r\\n\\r\\nToo much miscarried with him, this potter who had not learned\\r\\nthoroughly! That he took revenge on his pots and creations, however,\\r\\nbecause they turned out badly--that was a sin against GOOD TASTE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also good taste in piety: THIS at last said: \\'Away with SUCH\\r\\na God! Better to have no God, better to set up destiny on one\\'s own\\r\\naccount, better to be a fool, better to be God oneself!\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"What do I hear!\" said then the old pope, with intent ears; \"O\\r\\nZarathustra, thou art more pious than thou believest, with such an\\r\\nunbelief! Some God in thee hath converted thee to thine ungodliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee believe in a\\r\\nGod? And thine over-great honesty will yet lead thee even beyond good\\r\\nand evil!\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold, what hath been reserved for thee? Thou hast eyes and hands and\\r\\nmouth, which have been predestined for blessing from eternity. One doth\\r\\nnot bless with the hand alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNigh unto thee, though thou professest to be the ungodliest one, I feel\\r\\na hale and holy odour of long benedictions: I feel glad and grieved\\r\\nthereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me be thy guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! Nowhere on earth\\r\\nshall I now feel better than with thee!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Amen! So shall it be!\" said Zarathustra, with great astonishment; \"up\\r\\nthither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nGladly, forsooth, would I conduct thee thither myself, thou venerable\\r\\none; for I love all pious men. But now a cry of distress calleth me\\r\\nhastily away from thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my domain shall no one come to grief; my cave is a good haven. And\\r\\nbest of all would I like to put every sorrowful one again on firm land\\r\\nand firm legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho, however, could take THY melancholy off thy shoulders? For that I am\\r\\ntoo weak. Long, verily, should we have to wait until some one re-awoke\\r\\nthy God for thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that old God liveth no more: he is indeed dead.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXVII. THE UGLIEST MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And again did Zarathustra\\'s feet run through mountains and forests,\\r\\nand his eyes sought and sought, but nowhere was he to be seen whom they\\r\\nwanted to see--the sorely distressed sufferer and crier. On the whole\\r\\nway, however, he rejoiced in his heart and was full of gratitude. \"What\\r\\ngood things,\" said he, \"hath this day given me, as amends for its bad\\r\\nbeginning! What strange interlocutors have I found!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt their words will I now chew a long while as at good corn; small\\r\\nshall my teeth grind and crush them, until they flow like milk into my\\r\\nsoul!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, the path again curved round a rock, all at once the\\r\\nlandscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a realm of death. Here\\r\\nbristled aloft black and red cliffs, without any grass, tree, or bird\\'s\\r\\nvoice. For it was a valley which all animals avoided, even the beasts of\\r\\nprey, except that a species of ugly, thick, green serpent came here to\\r\\ndie when they became old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley:\\r\\n\"Serpent-death.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra, however, became absorbed in dark recollections, for it\\r\\nseemed to him as if he had once before stood in this valley. And much\\r\\nheaviness settled on his mind, so that he walked slowly and always more\\r\\nslowly, and at last stood still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes,\\r\\nhe saw something sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly\\r\\nlike a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came over\\r\\nZarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such a thing.\\r\\nBlushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he turned aside his\\r\\nglance, and raised his foot that he might leave this ill-starred place.\\r\\nThen, however, became the dead wilderness vocal: for from the ground a\\r\\nnoise welled up, gurgling and rattling, as water gurgleth and rattleth\\r\\nat night through stopped-up water-pipes; and at last it turned into\\r\\nhuman voice and human speech:--it sounded thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Say, say! WHAT IS THE REVENGE\\r\\nON THE WITNESS?\\r\\n\\r\\nI entice thee back; here is smooth ice! See to it, see to it, that thy\\r\\npride doth not here break its legs!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou thinkest thyself wise, thou proud Zarathustra! Read then the\\r\\nriddle, thou hard nut-cracker,--the riddle that I am! Say then: who am\\r\\n_I_!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--When however Zarathustra had heard these words,--what think ye then\\r\\ntook place in his soul? PITY OVERCAME HIM; and he sank down all at\\r\\nonce, like an oak that hath long withstood many tree-fellers,--heavily,\\r\\nsuddenly, to the terror even of those who meant to fell it. But\\r\\nimmediately he got up again from the ground, and his countenance became\\r\\nstern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I know thee well,\" said he, with a brazen voice, \"THOU ART THE MURDERER\\r\\nOF GOD! Let me go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou couldst not ENDURE him who beheld THEE,--who ever beheld thee\\r\\nthrough and through, thou ugliest man. Thou tookest revenge on this\\r\\nwitness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra and was about to go; but the nondescript grasped\\r\\nat a corner of his garment and began anew to gurgle and seek for words.\\r\\n\"Stay,\" said he at last--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Stay! Do not pass by! I have divined what axe it was that struck thee\\r\\nto the ground: hail to thee, O Zarathustra, that thou art again upon thy\\r\\nfeet!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast divined, I know it well, how the man feeleth who killed\\r\\nhim,--the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here beside me; it is not to\\r\\nno purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo whom would I go but unto thee? Stay, sit down! Do not however look at\\r\\nme! Honour thus--mine ugliness!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey persecute me: now art THOU my last refuge. NOT with their hatred,\\r\\nNOT with their bailiffs;--Oh, such persecution would I mock at, and be\\r\\nproud and cheerful!\\r\\n\\r\\nHath not all success hitherto been with the well-persecuted ones? And\\r\\nhe who persecuteth well learneth readily to be OBSEQUENT--when once he\\r\\nis--put behind! But it is their PITY--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Their pity is it from which I flee away and flee to thee. O\\r\\nZarathustra, protect me, thou, my last refuge, thou sole one who\\r\\ndivinedst me:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thou hast divined how the man feeleth who killed HIM. Stay! And if\\r\\nthou wilt go, thou impatient one, go not the way that I came. THAT way\\r\\nis bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt thou angry with me because I have already racked language too long?\\r\\nBecause I have already counselled thee? But know that it is I, the\\r\\nugliest man,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where _I_ have gone, the way\\r\\nis bad. I tread all paths to death and destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that thou passedst me by in silence, that thou blushedst--I saw it\\r\\nwell: thereby did I know thee as Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one else would have thrown to me his alms, his pity, in look and\\r\\nspeech. But for that--I am not beggar enough: that didst thou divine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor that I am too RICH, rich in what is great, frightful, ugliest, most\\r\\nunutterable! Thy shame, O Zarathustra, HONOURED me!\\r\\n\\r\\nWith difficulty did I get out of the crowd of the pitiful,--that I might\\r\\nfind the only one who at present teacheth that \\'pity is obtrusive\\'--\\r\\nthyself, O Zarathustra!\\r\\n\\r\\n--Whether it be the pity of a God, or whether it be human pity, it is\\r\\noffensive to modesty. And unwillingness to help may be nobler than the\\r\\nvirtue that rusheth to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHAT however--namely, pity--is called virtue itself at present by\\r\\nall petty people:--they have no reverence for great misfortune, great\\r\\nugliness, great failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond all these do I look, as a dog looketh over the backs of thronging\\r\\nflocks of sheep. They are petty, good-wooled, good-willed, grey people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools, with backward-bent\\r\\nhead, so do I look at the throng of grey little waves and wills and\\r\\nsouls.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo long have we acknowledged them to be right, those petty people: SO\\r\\nwe have at last given them power as well;--and now do they teach that\\r\\n\\'good is only what petty people call good.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd \\'truth\\' is at present what the preacher spake who himself sprang\\r\\nfrom them, that singular saint and advocate of the petty people, who\\r\\ntestified of himself: \\'I--am the truth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThat immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly puffed up,--he\\r\\nwho taught no small error when he taught: \\'I--am the truth.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nHath an immodest one ever been answered more courteously?--Thou,\\r\\nhowever, O Zarathustra, passedst him by, and saidst: \\'Nay! Nay! Three\\r\\ntimes Nay!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThou warnedst against his error; thou warnedst--the first to do\\r\\nso--against pity:--not every one, not none, but thyself and thy type.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and verily when\\r\\nthou sayest: \\'From pity there cometh a heavy cloud; take heed, ye men!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n--When thou teachest: \\'All creators are hard, all great love is beyond\\r\\ntheir pity:\\' O Zarathustra, how well versed dost thou seem to me in\\r\\nweather-signs!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou thyself, however,--warn thyself also against THY pity! For many are\\r\\non their way to thee, many suffering, doubting, despairing, drowning,\\r\\nfreezing ones--\\r\\n\\r\\nI warn thee also against myself. Thou hast read my best, my worst\\r\\nriddle, myself, and what I have done. I know the axe that felleth thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he--HAD TO die: he looked with eyes which beheld EVERYTHING,--he\\r\\nbeheld men\\'s depths and dregs, all his hidden ignominy and ugliness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis pity knew no modesty: he crept into my dirtiest corners. This most\\r\\nprying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful one had to die.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ever beheld ME: on such a witness I would have revenge--or not live\\r\\nmyself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe God who beheld everything, AND ALSO MAN: that God had to die! Man\\r\\ncannot ENDURE it that such a witness should live.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra however got up, and prepared to\\r\\ngo on: for he felt frozen to the very bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou nondescript,\" said he, \"thou warnedst me against thy path. As\\r\\nthanks for it I praise mine to thee. Behold, up thither is the cave of\\r\\nZarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy cave is large and deep and hath many corners; there findeth he\\r\\nthat is most hidden his hiding-place. And close beside it, there are\\r\\na hundred lurking-places and by-places for creeping, fluttering, and\\r\\nhopping creatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou outcast, who hast cast thyself out, thou wilt not live amongst men\\r\\nand men\\'s pity? Well then, do like me! Thus wilt thou learn also from\\r\\nme; only the doer learneth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd talk first and foremost to mine animals! The proudest animal and the\\r\\nwisest animal--they might well be the right counsellors for us both!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra and went his way, more thoughtfully and slowly\\r\\neven than before: for he asked himself many things, and hardly knew what\\r\\nto answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How poor indeed is man,\" thought he in his heart, \"how ugly, how\\r\\nwheezy, how full of hidden shame!\\r\\n\\r\\nThey tell me that man loveth himself. Ah, how great must that self-love\\r\\nbe! How much contempt is opposed to it!\\r\\n\\r\\nEven this man hath loved himself, as he hath despised himself,--a great\\r\\nlover methinketh he is, and a great despiser.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one have I yet found who more thoroughly despised himself: even THAT\\r\\nis elevation. Alas, was THIS perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the great despisers. Man is something that hath to be\\r\\nsurpassed.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXVIII. THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and felt\\r\\nlonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over his spirit, so\\r\\nthat even his limbs became colder thereby. When, however, he wandered\\r\\non and on, uphill and down, at times past green meadows, though also\\r\\nsometimes over wild stony couches where formerly perhaps an impatient\\r\\nbrook had made its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What hath happened unto me?\" he asked himself, \"something warm and\\r\\nliving quickeneth me; it must be in the neighbourhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready am I less alone; unconscious companions and brethren rove around\\r\\nme; their warm breath toucheth my soul.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, he spied about and sought for the comforters of his\\r\\nlonesomeness, behold, there were kine there standing together on an\\r\\neminence, whose proximity and smell had warmed his heart. The kine,\\r\\nhowever, seemed to listen eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him\\r\\nwho approached. When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them,\\r\\nthen did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of the\\r\\nkine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the\\r\\nspeaker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals aside; for he\\r\\nfeared that some one had here met with harm, which the pity of the\\r\\nkine would hardly be able to relieve. But in this he was deceived; for\\r\\nbehold, there sat a man on the ground who seemed to be persuading\\r\\nthe animals to have no fear of him, a peaceable man and\\r\\nPreacher-on-the-Mount, out of whose eyes kindness itself preached. \"What\\r\\ndost thou seek here?\" called out Zarathustra in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do I here seek?\" answered he: \"the same that thou seekest, thou\\r\\nmischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For I tell thee\\r\\nthat I have already talked half a morning unto them, and just now were\\r\\nthey about to give me their answer. Why dost thou disturb them?\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no wise enter\\r\\ninto the kingdom of heaven. For we ought to learn from them one thing:\\r\\nruminating.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, although a man should gain the whole world, and yet not\\r\\nlearn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit him! He would not be\\r\\nrid of his affliction,\\r\\n\\r\\n--His great affliction: that, however, is at present called DISGUST. Who\\r\\nhath not at present his heart, his mouth and his eyes full of disgust?\\r\\nThou also! Thou also! But behold these kine!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the Preacher-on-the-Mount, and turned then his own look\\r\\ntowards Zarathustra--for hitherto it had rested lovingly on the kine--:\\r\\nthen, however, he put on a different expression. \"Who is this with whom\\r\\nI talk?\" he exclaimed frightened, and sprang up from the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra himself, the\\r\\nsurmounter of the great disgust, this is the eye, this is the mouth,\\r\\nthis is the heart of Zarathustra himself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd whilst he thus spake he kissed with o\\'erflowing eyes the hands\\r\\nof him with whom he spake, and behaved altogether like one to whom a\\r\\nprecious gift and jewel hath fallen unawares from heaven. The kine,\\r\\nhowever, gazed at it all and wondered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak not of me, thou strange one; thou amiable one!\" said Zarathustra,\\r\\nand restrained his affection, \"speak to me firstly of thyself! Art thou\\r\\nnot the voluntary beggar who once cast away great riches,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled to the poorest\\r\\nto bestow upon them his abundance and his heart? But they received him\\r\\nnot.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But they received me not,\" said the voluntary beggar, \"thou knowest it,\\r\\nforsooth. So I went at last to the animals and to those kine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Then learnedst thou,\" interrupted Zarathustra, \"how much harder it is\\r\\nto give properly than to take properly, and that bestowing well is an\\r\\nART--the last, subtlest master-art of kindness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Especially nowadays,\" answered the voluntary beggar: \"at present, that\\r\\nis to say, when everything low hath become rebellious and exclusive and\\r\\nhaughty in its manner--in the manner of the populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the great, evil,\\r\\nlong, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth and extendeth!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and petty giving;\\r\\nand the overrich may be on their guard!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too-small\\r\\nnecks:--of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh the necks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace-pride: all\\r\\nthese struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed.\\r\\nThe kingdom of heaven, however, is with the kine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And why is it not with the rich?\" asked Zarathustra temptingly, while\\r\\nhe kept back the kine which sniffed familiarly at the peaceful one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why dost thou tempt me?\" answered the other. \"Thou knowest it thyself\\r\\nbetter even than I. What was it drove me to the poorest, O Zarathustra?\\r\\nWas it not my disgust at the richest?\\r\\n\\r\\n--At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, who pick\\r\\nup profit out of all kinds of rubbish--at this rabble that stinketh to\\r\\nheaven,\\r\\n\\r\\n--At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were pickpockets,\\r\\nor carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives compliant, lewd and\\r\\nforgetful:--for they are all of them not far different from harlots--\\r\\n\\r\\nPopulace above, populace below! What are \\'poor\\' and \\'rich\\' at present!\\r\\nThat distinction did I unlearn,--then did I flee away further and ever\\r\\nfurther, until I came to those kine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the peaceful one, and puffed himself and perspired with\\r\\nhis words: so that the kine wondered anew. Zarathustra, however, kept\\r\\nlooking into his face with a smile, all the time the man talked so\\r\\nseverely--and shook silently his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou doest violence to thyself, thou Preacher-on-the-Mount, when thou\\r\\nusest such severe words. For such severity neither thy mouth nor thine\\r\\neye have been given thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, methinketh, hath thy stomach either: unto IT all such rage and\\r\\nhatred and foaming-over is repugnant. Thy stomach wanteth softer things:\\r\\nthou art not a butcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather seemest thou to me a plant-eater and a root-man. Perhaps thou\\r\\ngrindest corn. Certainly, however, thou art averse to fleshly joys, and\\r\\nthou lovest honey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou hast divined me well,\" answered the voluntary beggar, with\\r\\nlightened heart. \"I love honey, I also grind corn; for I have sought out\\r\\nwhat tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Also what requireth a long time, a day\\'s-work and a mouth\\'s-work for\\r\\ngentle idlers and sluggards.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthest, to be sure, have those kine carried it: they have devised\\r\\nruminating and lying in the sun. They also abstain from all heavy\\r\\nthoughts which inflate the heart.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"Well!\" said Zarathustra, \"thou shouldst also see MINE animals, mine\\r\\neagle and my serpent,--their like do not at present exist on earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be to-night its guest. And\\r\\ntalk to mine animals of the happiness of animals,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress calleth me hastily\\r\\naway from thee. Also, shouldst thou find new honey with me, ice-cold,\\r\\ngolden-comb-honey, eat it!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however, take leave at once of thy kine, thou strange one! thou\\r\\namiable one! though it be hard for thee. For they are thy warmest\\r\\nfriends and preceptors!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"One excepted, whom I hold still dearer,\" answered the voluntary\\r\\nbeggar. \"Thou thyself art good, O Zarathustra, and better even than a\\r\\ncow!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Away, away with thee! thou evil flatterer!\" cried Zarathustra\\r\\nmischievously, \"why dost thou spoil me with such praise and\\r\\nflattery-honey?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Away, away from me!\" cried he once more, and heaved his stick at the\\r\\nfond beggar, who, however, ran nimbly away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXIX. THE SHADOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste, and Zarathustra\\r\\nagain alone, when he heard behind him a new voice which called out:\\r\\n\"Stay! Zarathustra! Do wait! It is myself, forsooth, O Zarathustra,\\r\\nmyself, thy shadow!\" But Zarathustra did not wait; for a sudden\\r\\nirritation came over him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his\\r\\nmountains. \"Whither hath my lonesomeness gone?\" spake he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is verily becoming too much for me; these mountains swarm; my\\r\\nkingdom is no longer of THIS world; I require new mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy shadow calleth me? What matter about my shadow! Let it run after me!\\r\\nI--run away from it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra to his heart and ran away. But the one behind\\r\\nfollowed after him, so that immediately there were three runners,\\r\\none after the other--namely, foremost the voluntary beggar, then\\r\\nZarathustra, and thirdly, and hindmost, his shadow. But not long had\\r\\nthey run thus when Zarathustra became conscious of his folly, and shook\\r\\noff with one jerk all his irritation and detestation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What!\" said he, \"have not the most ludicrous things always happened to\\r\\nus old anchorites and saints?\\r\\n\\r\\nVerily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do I hear six old\\r\\nfools\\' legs rattling behind one another!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? Also,\\r\\nmethinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and entrails, he stood\\r\\nstill and turned round quickly--and behold, he almost thereby threw his\\r\\nshadow and follower to the ground, so closely had the latter followed at\\r\\nhis heels, and so weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him\\r\\nwith his glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender,\\r\\nswarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who art thou?\" asked Zarathustra vehemently, \"what doest thou here? And\\r\\nwhy callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art not pleasing unto me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Forgive me,\" answered the shadow, \"that it is I; and if I please thee\\r\\nnot--well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee and thy good taste.\\r\\n\\r\\nA wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always on the way,\\r\\nbut without a goal, also without a home: so that verily, I lack little\\r\\nof being the eternally Wandering Jew, except that I am not eternal and\\r\\nnot a Jew.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, unsettled,\\r\\ndriven about? O earth, thou hast become too round for me!\\r\\n\\r\\nOn every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I fallen\\r\\nasleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh from me, nothing\\r\\ngiveth; I become thin--I am almost equal to a shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter thee, however, O Zarathustra, did I fly and hie longest; and\\r\\nthough I hid myself from thee, I was nevertheless thy best shadow:\\r\\nwherever thou hast sat, there sat I also.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest worlds, like a\\r\\nphantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs and snows.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst and the\\r\\nfurthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is that I have\\r\\nhad no fear of any prohibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all\\r\\nboundary-stones and statues have I o\\'erthrown; the most dangerous wishes\\r\\ndid I pursue,--verily, beyond every crime did I once go.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thee did I unlearn the belief in words and worths and in great\\r\\nnames. When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his name also fall\\r\\naway? It is also skin. The devil himself is perhaps--skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Nothing is true, all is permitted\\': so said I to myself. Into the\\r\\ncoldest water did I plunge with head and heart. Ah, how oft did I stand\\r\\nthere naked on that account, like a red crab!\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and all my belief\\r\\nin the good! Ah, where is the lying innocence which I once possessed,\\r\\nthe innocence of the good and of their noble lies!\\r\\n\\r\\nToo oft, verily, did I follow close to the heels of truth: then did it\\r\\nkick me on the face. Sometimes I meant to lie, and behold! then only did\\r\\nI hit--the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nToo much hath become clear unto me: now it doth not concern me any more.\\r\\nNothing liveth any longer that I love,--how should I still love myself?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'To live as I incline, or not to live at all\\': so do I wish; so wisheth\\r\\nalso the holiest. But alas! how have _I_ still--inclination?\\r\\n\\r\\nHave _I_--still a goal? A haven towards which MY sail is set?\\r\\n\\r\\nA good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth WHITHER he saileth, knoweth what\\r\\nwind is good, and a fair wind for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; an unstable\\r\\nwill; fluttering wings; a broken backbone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seeking for MY home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know that this\\r\\nseeking hath been MY home-sickening; it eateth me up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'WHERE is--MY home?\\' For it do I ask and seek, and have sought, but\\r\\nhave not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal nowhere, O\\r\\neternal--in-vain!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra\\'s countenance lengthened at his\\r\\nwords. \"Thou art my shadow!\" said he at last sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thy danger is not small, thou free spirit and wanderer! Thou hast had a\\r\\nbad day: see that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at last even a prisoner blessed.\\r\\nDidst thou ever see how captured criminals sleep? They sleep quietly,\\r\\nthey enjoy their new security.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, rigorous\\r\\ndelusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and\\r\\ntempteth thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast lost thy goal. Alas, how wilt thou forego and forget that\\r\\nloss? Thereby--hast thou also lost thy way!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou poor rover and rambler, thou tired butterfly! wilt thou have a rest\\r\\nand a home this evening? Then go up to my cave!\\r\\n\\r\\nThither leadeth the way to my cave. And now will I run quickly away from\\r\\nthee again. Already lieth as it were a shadow upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will run alone, so that it may again become bright around me.\\r\\nTherefore must I still be a long time merrily upon my legs. In the\\r\\nevening, however, there will be--dancing with me!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXX. NOONTIDE.\\r\\n\\r\\n--And Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, and was alone\\r\\nand ever found himself again; he enjoyed and quaffed his solitude, and\\r\\nthought of good things--for hours. About the hour of noontide, however,\\r\\nwhen the sun stood exactly over Zarathustra\\'s head, he passed an old,\\r\\nbent and gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of\\r\\na vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow grapes in\\r\\nabundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt inclined to quench a\\r\\nlittle thirst, and to break off for himself a cluster of grapes. When,\\r\\nhowever, he had already his arm out-stretched for that purpose, he felt\\r\\nstill more inclined for something else--namely, to lie down beside the\\r\\ntree at the hour of perfect noontide and sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on the ground in\\r\\nthe stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, than he had forgotten\\r\\nhis little thirst, and fell asleep. For as the proverb of Zarathustra\\r\\nsaith: \"One thing is more necessary than the other.\" Only that his eyes\\r\\nremained open:--for they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the\\r\\ntree and the love of the vine. In falling asleep, however, Zarathustra\\r\\nspake thus to his heart:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hush! Hush! Hath not the world now become perfect? What hath happened\\r\\nunto me?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas, light,\\r\\nfeather-light, so--danceth sleep upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo eye doth it close to me, it leaveth my soul awake. Light is it,\\r\\nverily, feather-light.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt persuadeth me, I know not how, it toucheth me inwardly with a\\r\\ncaressing hand, it constraineth me. Yea, it constraineth me, so that my\\r\\nsoul stretcheth itself out:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--How long and weary it becometh, my strange soul! Hath a seventh-day\\r\\nevening come to it precisely at noontide? Hath it already wandered too\\r\\nlong, blissfully, among good and ripe things?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt stretcheth itself out, long--longer! it lieth still, my strange\\r\\nsoul. Too many good things hath it already tasted; this golden sadness\\r\\noppresseth it, it distorteth its mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\n--As a ship that putteth into the calmest cove:--it now draweth up to\\r\\nthe land, weary of long voyages and uncertain seas. Is not the land more\\r\\nfaithful?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such a ship huggeth the shore, tuggeth the shore:--then it sufficeth\\r\\nfor a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the land. No stronger\\r\\nropes are required there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs such a weary ship in the calmest cove, so do I also now repose, nigh\\r\\nto the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, bound to it with the lightest\\r\\nthreads.\\r\\n\\r\\nO happiness! O happiness! Wilt thou perhaps sing, O my soul? Thou liest\\r\\nin the grass. But this is the secret, solemn hour, when no shepherd\\r\\nplayeth his pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake care! Hot noontide sleepeth on the fields. Do not sing! Hush! The\\r\\nworld is perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not sing, thou prairie-bird, my soul! Do not even whisper! Lo--hush!\\r\\nThe old noontide sleepeth, it moveth its mouth: doth it not just now\\r\\ndrink a drop of happiness--\\r\\n\\r\\n--An old brown drop of golden happiness, golden wine? Something whisketh\\r\\nover it, its happiness laugheth. Thus--laugheth a God. Hush!--\\r\\n\\r\\n--\\'For happiness, how little sufficeth for happiness!\\' Thus spake I\\r\\nonce and thought myself wise. But it was a blasphemy: THAT have I now\\r\\nlearned. Wise fools speak better.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest thing, a\\r\\nlizard\\'s rustling, a breath, a whisk, an eye-glance--LITTLE maketh up\\r\\nthe BEST happiness. Hush!\\r\\n\\r\\n--What hath befallen me: Hark! Hath time flown away? Do I not fall? Have\\r\\nI not fallen--hark! into the well of eternity?\\r\\n\\r\\n--What happeneth to me? Hush! It stingeth me--alas--to the heart? To\\r\\nthe heart! Oh, break up, break up, my heart, after such happiness, after\\r\\nsuch a sting!\\r\\n\\r\\n--What? Hath not the world just now become perfect? Round and ripe? Oh,\\r\\nfor the golden round ring--whither doth it fly? Let me run after it!\\r\\nQuick!\\r\\n\\r\\nHush--\" (and here Zarathustra stretched himself, and felt that he was\\r\\nasleep.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Up!\" said he to himself, \"thou sleeper! Thou noontide sleeper! Well\\r\\nthen, up, ye old legs! It is time and more than time; many a good\\r\\nstretch of road is still awaiting you--\\r\\n\\r\\nNow have ye slept your fill; for how long a time? A half-eternity! Well\\r\\nthen, up now, mine old heart! For how long after such a sleep mayest\\r\\nthou--remain awake?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(But then did he fall asleep anew, and his soul spake against him and\\r\\ndefended itself, and lay down again)--\"Leave me alone! Hush! Hath not\\r\\nthe world just now become perfect? Oh, for the golden round ball!--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get up,\" said Zarathustra, \"thou little thief, thou sluggard! What!\\r\\nStill stretching thyself, yawning, sighing, falling into deep wells?\\r\\n\\r\\nWho art thou then, O my soul!\" (and here he became frightened, for a\\r\\nsunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O heaven above me,\" said he sighing, and sat upright, \"thou gazest at\\r\\nme? Thou hearkenest unto my strange soul?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon all earthly\\r\\nthings,--when wilt thou drink this strange soul--\\r\\n\\r\\n--When, thou well of eternity! thou joyous, awful, noontide abyss! when\\r\\nwilt thou drink my soul back into thee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and rose from his couch beside the tree, as if\\r\\nawakening from a strange drunkenness: and behold! there stood the\\r\\nsun still exactly above his head. One might, however, rightly infer\\r\\ntherefrom that Zarathustra had not then slept long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXI. THE GREETING.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long useless\\r\\nsearching and strolling about, again came home to his cave. When,\\r\\nhowever, he stood over against it, not more than twenty paces therefrom,\\r\\nthe thing happened which he now least of all expected: he heard anew the\\r\\ngreat CRY OF DISTRESS. And extraordinary! this time the cry came out\\r\\nof his own cave. It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra\\r\\nplainly distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although\\r\\nheard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, and behold! what a\\r\\nspectacle awaited him after that concert! For there did they all sit\\r\\ntogether whom he had passed during the day: the king on the right and\\r\\nthe king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary\\r\\nbeggar, the shadow, the intellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful\\r\\nsoothsayer, and the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on\\r\\nhis head, and had put round him two purple girdles,--for he liked, like\\r\\nall ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome person. In the\\r\\nmidst, however, of that sorrowful company stood Zarathustra\\'s eagle,\\r\\nruffled and disquieted, for it had been called upon to answer too much\\r\\nfor which its pride had not any answer; the wise serpent however hung\\r\\nround its neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; then however he\\r\\nscrutinised each individual guest with courteous curiosity, read their\\r\\nsouls and wondered anew. In the meantime the assembled ones had risen\\r\\nfrom their seats, and waited with reverence for Zarathustra to speak.\\r\\nZarathustra however spake thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was YOUR cry of distress\\r\\nthat I heard? And now do I know also where he is to be sought, whom I\\r\\nhave sought for in vain to-day: THE HIGHER MAN--:\\r\\n\\r\\n--In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man! But why do I wonder! Have\\r\\nnot I myself allured him to me by honey-offerings and artful lure-calls\\r\\nof my happiness?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for company: ye make\\r\\none another\\'s hearts fretful, ye that cry for help, when ye sit here\\r\\ntogether? There is one that must first come,\\r\\n\\r\\n--One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial buffoon, a\\r\\ndancer, a wind, a wild romp, some old fool:--what think ye?\\r\\n\\r\\nForgive me, however, ye despairing ones, for speaking such trivial words\\r\\nbefore you, unworthy, verily, of such guests! But ye do not divine WHAT\\r\\nmaketh my heart wanton:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ye yourselves do it, and your aspect, forgive it me! For every one\\r\\nbecometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing one. To encourage a\\r\\ndespairing one--every one thinketh himself strong enough to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo myself have ye given this power,--a good gift, mine honourable\\r\\nguests! An excellent guest\\'s-present! Well, do not then upbraid when I\\r\\nalso offer you something of mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, however, shall\\r\\nthis evening and tonight be yours. Mine animals shall serve you: let my\\r\\ncave be your resting-place!\\r\\n\\r\\nAt house and home with me shall no one despair: in my purlieus do I\\r\\nprotect every one from his wild beasts. And that is the first thing\\r\\nwhich I offer you: security!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second thing, however, is my little finger. And when ye have THAT,\\r\\nthen take the whole hand also, yea, and the heart with it! Welcome here,\\r\\nwelcome to you, my guests!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mischief. After this\\r\\ngreeting his guests bowed once more and were reverentially silent; the\\r\\nking on the right, however, answered him in their name.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy hand and thy\\r\\ngreeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou hast humbled thyself\\r\\nbefore us; almost hast thou hurt our reverence--:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who however could have humbled himself as thou hast done, with such\\r\\npride? THAT uplifteth us ourselves; a refreshment is it, to our eyes and\\r\\nhearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo behold this, merely, gladly would we ascend higher mountains than\\r\\nthis. For as eager beholders have we come; we wanted to see what\\r\\nbrighteneth dim eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd lo! now is it all over with our cries of distress. Now are our minds\\r\\nand hearts open and enraptured. Little is lacking for our spirits to\\r\\nbecome wanton.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is nothing, O Zarathustra, that groweth more pleasingly on earth\\r\\nthan a lofty, strong will: it is the finest growth. An entire landscape\\r\\nrefresheth itself at one such tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the pine do I compare him, O Zarathustra, which groweth up like\\r\\nthee--tall, silent, hardy, solitary, of the best, supplest wood,\\r\\nstately,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--In the end, however, grasping out for ITS dominion with strong, green\\r\\nbranches, asking weighty questions of the wind, the storm, and whatever\\r\\nis at home on high places;\\r\\n\\r\\n--Answering more weightily, a commander, a victor! Oh! who should not\\r\\nascend high mountains to behold such growths?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt thy tree, O Zarathustra, the gloomy and ill-constituted also refresh\\r\\nthemselves; at thy look even the wavering become steady and heal their\\r\\nhearts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes turn to-day;\\r\\na great longing hath arisen, and many have learned to ask: \\'Who is\\r\\nZarathustra?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped thy song and thy\\r\\nhoney: all the hidden ones, the lone-dwellers and the twain-dwellers,\\r\\nhave simultaneously said to their hearts:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to live,\\r\\neverything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else--we must live\\r\\nwith Zarathustra!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Why doth he not come who hath so long announced himself?\\' thus do many\\r\\npeople ask; \\'hath solitude swallowed him up? Or should we perhaps go to\\r\\nhim?\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nNow doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh fragile and\\r\\nbreaketh open, like a grave that breaketh open and can no longer hold\\r\\nits dead. Everywhere one seeth resurrected ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O Zarathustra. And\\r\\nhowever high be thy height, many of them must rise up to thee: thy boat\\r\\nshall not rest much longer on dry ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, and already no\\r\\nlonger despair:--it is but a prognostic and a presage that better ones\\r\\nare on the way to thee,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last remnant of\\r\\nGod among men--that is to say, all the men of great longing, of great\\r\\nloathing, of great satiety,\\r\\n\\r\\n--All who do not want to live unless they learn again to HOPE--unless\\r\\nthey learn from thee, O Zarathustra, the GREAT hope!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the king on the right, and seized the hand of Zarathustra in\\r\\norder to kiss it; but Zarathustra checked his veneration, and stepped\\r\\nback frightened, fleeing as it were, silently and suddenly into the far\\r\\ndistance. After a little while, however, he was again at home with his\\r\\nguests, looked at them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My guests, ye higher men, I will speak plain language and plainly with\\r\\nyou. It is not for YOU that I have waited here in these mountains.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(\"\\'Plain language and plainly?\\' Good God!\" said here the king on the\\r\\nleft to himself; \"one seeth he doth not know the good Occidentals, this\\r\\nsage out of the Orient!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he meaneth \\'blunt language and bluntly\\'--well! That is not the worst\\r\\ntaste in these days!\")\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye may, verily, all of you be higher men,\" continued Zarathustra; \"but\\r\\nfor me--ye are neither high enough, nor strong enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor me, that is to say, for the inexorable which is now silent in me,\\r\\nbut will not always be silent. And if ye appertain to me, still it is\\r\\nnot as my right arm.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor he who himself standeth, like you, on sickly and tender legs,\\r\\nwisheth above all to be TREATED INDULGENTLY, whether he be conscious of\\r\\nit or hide it from himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy arms and my legs, however, I do not treat indulgently, I DO NOT TREAT\\r\\nMY WARRIORS INDULGENTLY: how then could ye be fit for MY warfare?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith you I should spoil all my victories. And many of you would tumble\\r\\nover if ye but heard the loud beating of my drums.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well-born for me. I\\r\\nrequire pure, smooth mirrors for my doctrines; on your surface even mine\\r\\nown likeness is distorted.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn your shoulders presseth many a burden, many a recollection; many a\\r\\nmischievous dwarf squatteth in your corners. There is concealed populace\\r\\nalso in you.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though ye be high and of a higher type, much in you is crooked and\\r\\nmisshapen. There is no smith in the world that could hammer you right\\r\\nand straight for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe are only bridges: may higher ones pass over upon you! Ye signify\\r\\nsteps: so do not upbraid him who ascendeth beyond you into HIS height!\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of your seed there may one day arise for me a genuine son and\\r\\nperfect heir: but that time is distant. Ye yourselves are not those unto\\r\\nwhom my heritage and name belong.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot for you do I wait here in these mountains; not with you may I\\r\\ndescend for the last time. Ye have come unto me only as a presage that\\r\\nhigher ones are on the way to me,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--NOT the men of great longing, of great loathing, of great satiety, and\\r\\nthat which ye call the remnant of God;\\r\\n\\r\\n--Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! For OTHERS do I wait here in these\\r\\nmountains, and will not lift my foot from thence without them;\\r\\n\\r\\n--For higher ones, stronger ones, triumphanter ones, merrier ones, for\\r\\nsuch as are built squarely in body and soul: LAUGHING LIONS must come!\\r\\n\\r\\nO my guests, ye strange ones--have ye yet heard nothing of my children?\\r\\nAnd that they are on the way to me?\\r\\n\\r\\nDo speak unto me of my gardens, of my Happy Isles, of my new beautiful\\r\\nrace--why do ye not speak unto me thereof?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis guests\\'-present do I solicit of your love, that ye speak unto me of\\r\\nmy children. For them am I rich, for them I became poor: what have I not\\r\\nsurrendered,\\r\\n\\r\\n--What would I not surrender that I might have one thing: THESE\\r\\nchildren, THIS living plantation, THESE life-trees of my will and of my\\r\\nhighest hope!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra, and stopped suddenly in his discourse: for his\\r\\nlonging came over him, and he closed his eyes and his mouth, because\\r\\nof the agitation of his heart. And all his guests also were silent, and\\r\\nstood still and confounded: except only that the old soothsayer made\\r\\nsigns with his hands and his gestures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXII. THE SUPPER.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor at this point the soothsayer interrupted the greeting of Zarathustra\\r\\nand his guests: he pressed forward as one who had no time to lose,\\r\\nseized Zarathustra\\'s hand and exclaimed: \"But Zarathustra!\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is more necessary than the other, so sayest thou thyself:\\r\\nwell, one thing is now more necessary UNTO ME than all others.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word at the right time: didst thou not invite me to TABLE? And here\\r\\nare many who have made long journeys. Thou dost not mean to feed us\\r\\nmerely with discourses?\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, all of you have thought too much about freezing, drowning,\\r\\nsuffocating, and other bodily dangers: none of you, however, have\\r\\nthought of MY danger, namely, perishing of hunger-\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(Thus spake the soothsayer. When Zarathustra\\'s animals, however, heard\\r\\nthese words, they ran away in terror. For they saw that all they\\r\\nhad brought home during the day would not be enough to fill the one\\r\\nsoothsayer.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Likewise perishing of thirst,\" continued the soothsayer. \"And although\\r\\nI hear water splashing here like words of wisdom--that is to say,\\r\\nplenteously and unweariedly, I--want WINE!\\r\\n\\r\\nNot every one is a born water-drinker like Zarathustra. Neither doth\\r\\nwater suit weary and withered ones: WE deserve wine--IT alone giveth\\r\\nimmediate vigour and improvised health!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this occasion, when the soothsayer was longing for wine, it happened\\r\\nthat the king on the left, the silent one, also found expression for\\r\\nonce. \"WE took care,\" said he, \"about wine, I, along with my brother the\\r\\nking on the right: we have enough of wine,--a whole ass-load of it. So\\r\\nthere is nothing lacking but bread.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bread,\" replied Zarathustra, laughing when he spake, \"it is precisely\\r\\nbread that anchorites have not. But man doth not live by bread alone,\\r\\nbut also by the flesh of good lambs, of which I have two:\\r\\n\\r\\n--THESE shall we slaughter quickly, and cook spicily with sage: it is\\r\\nso that I like them. And there is also no lack of roots and fruits,\\r\\ngood enough even for the fastidious and dainty,--nor of nuts and other\\r\\nriddles for cracking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus will we have a good repast in a little while. But whoever wish to\\r\\neat with us must also give a hand to the work, even the kings. For with\\r\\nZarathustra even a king may be a cook.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them, save that the\\r\\nvoluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and spices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just hear this glutton Zarathustra!\" said he jokingly: \"doth one go\\r\\ninto caves and high mountains to make such repasts?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow indeed do I understand what he once taught us: Blessed be moderate\\r\\npoverty!\\' And why he wisheth to do away with beggars.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Be of good cheer,\" replied Zarathustra, \"as I am. Abide by thy\\r\\ncustoms, thou excellent one: grind thy corn, drink thy water, praise thy\\r\\ncooking,--if only it make thee glad!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a law only for mine own; I am not a law for all. He, however, who\\r\\nbelongeth unto me must be strong of bone and light of foot,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Joyous in fight and feast, no sulker, no John o\\' Dreams, ready for the\\r\\nhardest task as for the feast, healthy and hale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best belongeth unto mine and me; and if it be not given us, then do\\r\\nwe take it:--the best food, the purest sky, the strongest thoughts, the\\r\\nfairest women!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra; the king on the right however answered and said:\\r\\n\"Strange! Did one ever hear such sensible things out of the mouth of a\\r\\nwise man?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, it is the strangest thing in a wise man, if over and above,\\r\\nhe be still sensible, and not an ass.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the king on the right and wondered; the ass however, with\\r\\nill-will, said YE-A to his remark. This however was the beginning of\\r\\nthat long repast which is called \"The Supper\" in the history-books. At\\r\\nthis there was nothing else spoken of but THE HIGHER MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIII. THE HIGHER MAN.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came unto men for the first time, then did I commit the anchorite\\r\\nfolly, the great folly: I appeared on the market-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when I spake unto all, I spake unto none. In the evening, however,\\r\\nrope-dancers were my companions, and corpses; and I myself almost a\\r\\ncorpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the new morning, however, there came unto me a new truth: then did\\r\\nI learn to say: \"Of what account to me are market-place and populace and\\r\\npopulace-noise and long populace-ears!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, learn THIS from me: On the market-place no one believeth\\r\\nin higher men. But if ye will speak there, very well! The populace,\\r\\nhowever, blinketh: \"We are all equal.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye higher men,\"--so blinketh the populace--\"there are no higher men, we\\r\\nare all equal; man is man, before God--we are all equal!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore God!--Now, however, this God hath died. Before the populace,\\r\\nhowever, we will not be equal. Ye higher men, away from the\\r\\nmarket-place!\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore God!--Now however this God hath died! Ye higher men, this God was\\r\\nyour greatest danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly since he lay in the grave have ye again arisen. Now only cometh the\\r\\ngreat noontide, now only doth the higher man become--master!\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ye understood this word, O my brethren? Ye are frightened: do your\\r\\nhearts turn giddy? Doth the abyss here yawn for you? Doth the hell-hound\\r\\nhere yelp at you?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! Take heart! ye higher men! Now only travaileth the mountain of the\\r\\nhuman future. God hath died: now do WE desire--the Superman to live.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most careful ask to-day: \"How is man to be maintained?\" Zarathustra\\r\\nhowever asketh, as the first and only one: \"How is man to be SURPASSED?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Superman, I have at heart; THAT is the first and only thing to\\r\\nme--and NOT man: not the neighbour, not the poorest, not the sorriest,\\r\\nnot the best.--\\r\\n\\r\\nO my brethren, what I can love in man is that he is an over-going and a\\r\\ndown-going. And also in you there is much that maketh me love and hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me hope. For the\\r\\ngreat despisers are the great reverers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that ye have despaired, there is much to honour. For ye have not\\r\\nlearned to submit yourselves, ye have not learned petty policy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor to-day have the petty people become master: they all preach\\r\\nsubmission and humility and policy and diligence and consideration and\\r\\nthe long et cetera of petty virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever is of the effeminate type, whatever originateth from the\\r\\nservile type, and especially the populace-mishmash:--THAT wisheth now to\\r\\nbe master of all human destiny--O disgust! Disgust! Disgust!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHAT asketh and asketh and never tireth: \"How is man to maintain himself\\r\\nbest, longest, most pleasantly?\" Thereby--are they the masters of\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese masters of to-day--surpass them, O my brethren--these petty\\r\\npeople: THEY are the Superman\\'s greatest danger!\\r\\n\\r\\nSurpass, ye higher men, the petty virtues, the petty policy, the\\r\\nsand-grain considerateness, the ant-hill trumpery, the pitiable\\r\\ncomfortableness, the \"happiness of the greatest number\"--!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd rather despair than submit yourselves. And verily, I love you,\\r\\nbecause ye know not to-day how to live, ye higher men! For thus do YE\\r\\nlive--best!\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ye courage, O my brethren? Are ye stout-hearted? NOT the courage\\r\\nbefore witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, which not even a God\\r\\nany longer beholdeth?\\r\\n\\r\\nCold souls, mules, the blind and the drunken, I do not call\\r\\nstout-hearted. He hath heart who knoweth fear, but VANQUISHETH it; who\\r\\nseeth the abyss, but with PRIDE.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who seeth the abyss, but with eagle\\'s eyes,--he who with eagle\\'s\\r\\ntalons GRASPETH the abyss: he hath courage.--\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man is evil\"--so said to me for consolation, all the wisest ones. Ah,\\r\\nif only it be still true to-day! For the evil is man\\'s best force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Man must become better and eviler\"--so do _I_ teach. The evilest is\\r\\nnecessary for the Superman\\'s best.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may have been well for the preacher of the petty people to suffer and\\r\\nbe burdened by men\\'s sin. I, however, rejoice in great sin as my great\\r\\nCONSOLATION.--\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch things, however, are not said for long ears. Every word, also,\\r\\nis not suited for every mouth. These are fine far-away things: at them\\r\\nsheep\\'s claws shall not grasp!\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye have put\\r\\nwrong?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr that I wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you sufferers?\\r\\nOr show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones, new and easier\\r\\nfootpaths?\\r\\n\\r\\nNay! Nay! Three times Nay! Always more, always better ones of your\\r\\ntype shall succumb,--for ye shall always have it worse and harder. Thus\\r\\nonly--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thus only groweth man aloft to the height where the lightning striketh\\r\\nand shattereth him: high enough for the lightning!\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards the few, the long, the remote go forth my soul and my seeking:\\r\\nof what account to me are your many little, short miseries!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe do not yet suffer enough for me! For ye suffer from yourselves, ye\\r\\nhave not yet suffered FROM MAN. Ye would lie if ye spake otherwise! None\\r\\nof you suffereth from what _I_ have suffered.--\\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not enough for me that the lightning no longer doeth harm. I do\\r\\nnot wish to conduct it away: it shall learn--to work for ME.--\\r\\n\\r\\nMy wisdom hath accumulated long like a cloud, it becometh stiller and\\r\\ndarker. So doeth all wisdom which shall one day bear LIGHTNINGS.--\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto these men of to-day will I not be LIGHT, nor be called light.\\r\\nTHEM--will I blind: lightning of my wisdom! put out their eyes!\\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not will anything beyond your power: there is a bad falseness in\\r\\nthose who will beyond their power.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially when they will great things! For they awaken distrust in\\r\\ngreat things, these subtle false-coiners and stage-players:--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Until at last they are false towards themselves, squint-eyed, whited\\r\\ncankers, glossed over with strong words, parade virtues and brilliant\\r\\nfalse deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake good care there, ye higher men! For nothing is more precious to me,\\r\\nand rarer, than honesty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this to-day not that of the populace? The populace however knoweth\\r\\nnot what is great and what is small, what is straight and what is\\r\\nhonest: it is innocently crooked, it ever lieth.\\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave a good distrust to-day ye, higher men, ye enheartened ones! Ye\\r\\nopen-hearted ones! And keep your reasons secret! For this to-day is that\\r\\nof the populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the populace once learned to believe without reasons, who could--\\r\\nrefute it to them by means of reasons?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd on the market-place one convinceth with gestures. But reasons make\\r\\nthe populace distrustful.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when truth hath once triumphed there, then ask yourselves with good\\r\\ndistrust: \"What strong error hath fought for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBe on your guard also against the learned! They hate you, because they\\r\\nare unproductive! They have cold, withered eyes before which every bird\\r\\nis unplumed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch persons vaunt about not lying: but inability to lie is still far\\r\\nfrom being love to truth. Be on your guard!\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom from fever is still far from being knowledge! Refrigerated\\r\\nspirits I do not believe in. He who cannot lie, doth not know what truth\\r\\nis.\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf ye would go up high, then use your own legs! Do not get yourselves\\r\\nCARRIED aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people\\'s backs and heads!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast mounted, however, on horseback? Thou now ridest briskly up\\r\\nto thy goal? Well, my friend! But thy lame foot is also with thee on\\r\\nhorseback!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen thou reachest thy goal, when thou alightest from thy horse:\\r\\nprecisely on thy HEIGHT, thou higher man,--then wilt thou stumble!\\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe creating ones, ye higher men! One is only pregnant with one\\'s own\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo not let yourselves be imposed upon or put upon! Who then is YOUR\\r\\nneighbour? Even if ye act \"for your neighbour\"--ye still do not create\\r\\nfor him!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlearn, I pray you, this \"for,\" ye creating ones: your very virtue\\r\\nwisheth you to have naught to do with \"for\" and \"on account of\" and\\r\\n\"because.\" Against these false little words shall ye stop your ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"For one\\'s neighbour,\" is the virtue only of the petty people: there it\\r\\nis said \"like and like,\" and \"hand washeth hand\":--they have neither the\\r\\nright nor the power for YOUR self-seeking!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your self-seeking, ye creating ones, there is the foresight and\\r\\nforeseeing of the pregnant! What no one\\'s eye hath yet seen, namely, the\\r\\nfruit--this, sheltereth and saveth and nourisheth your entire love.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere your entire love is, namely, with your child, there is also your\\r\\nentire virtue! Your work, your will is YOUR \"neighbour\": let no false\\r\\nvalues impose upon you!\\r\\n\\r\\n12.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe creating ones, ye higher men! Whoever hath to give birth is sick;\\r\\nwhoever hath given birth, however, is unclean.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsk women: one giveth birth, not because it giveth pleasure. The pain\\r\\nmaketh hens and poets cackle.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe creating ones, in you there is much uncleanliness. That is because ye\\r\\nhave had to be mothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new child: oh, how much new filth hath also come into the world! Go\\r\\napart! He who hath given birth shall wash his soul!\\r\\n\\r\\n13.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe not virtuous beyond your powers! And seek nothing from yourselves\\r\\nopposed to probability!\\r\\n\\r\\nWalk in the footsteps in which your fathers\\' virtue hath already walked!\\r\\nHow would ye rise high, if your fathers\\' will should not rise with you?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe, however, who would be a firstling, let him take care lest he also\\r\\nbecome a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers are, there should\\r\\nye not set up as saints!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe whose fathers were inclined for women, and for strong wine and flesh\\r\\nof wildboar swine; what would it be if he demanded chastity of himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nA folly would it be! Much, verily, doth it seem to me for such a one, if\\r\\nhe should be the husband of one or of two or of three women.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if he founded monasteries, and inscribed over their portals: \"The\\r\\nway to holiness,\"--I should still say: What good is it! it is a new\\r\\nfolly!\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hath founded for himself a penance-house and refuge-house: much good\\r\\nmay it do! But I do not believe in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn solitude there groweth what any one bringeth into it--also the brute\\r\\nin one\\'s nature. Thus is solitude inadvisable unto many.\\r\\n\\r\\nHath there ever been anything filthier on earth than the saints of\\r\\nthe wilderness? AROUND THEM was not only the devil loose--but also the\\r\\nswine.\\r\\n\\r\\n14.\\r\\n\\r\\nShy, ashamed, awkward, like the tiger whose spring hath failed--thus, ye\\r\\nhigher men, have I often seen you slink aside. A CAST which ye made had\\r\\nfailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what doth it matter, ye dice-players! Ye had not learned to play and\\r\\nmock, as one must play and mock! Do we not ever sit at a great table of\\r\\nmocking and playing?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if great things have been a failure with you, have ye yourselves\\r\\ntherefore--been a failure? And if ye yourselves have been a failure,\\r\\nhath man therefore--been a failure? If man, however, hath been a\\r\\nfailure: well then! never mind!\\r\\n\\r\\n15.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe higher its type, always the seldomer doth a thing succeed. Ye higher\\r\\nmen here, have ye not all--been failures?\\r\\n\\r\\nBe of good cheer; what doth it matter? How much is still possible! Learn\\r\\nto laugh at yourselves, as ye ought to laugh!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonder even that ye have failed and only half-succeeded, ye\\r\\nhalf-shattered ones! Doth not--man\\'s FUTURE strive and struggle in you?\\r\\n\\r\\nMan\\'s furthest, profoundest, star-highest issues, his prodigious\\r\\npowers--do not all these foam through one another in your vessel?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonder that many a vessel shattereth! Learn to laugh at yourselves,\\r\\nas ye ought to laugh! Ye higher men, O, how much is still possible!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, how much hath already succeeded! How rich is this earth in\\r\\nsmall, good, perfect things, in well-constituted things!\\r\\n\\r\\nSet around you small, good, perfect things, ye higher men. Their golden\\r\\nmaturity healeth the heart. The perfect teacheth one to hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n16.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth? Was it not the\\r\\nword of him who said: \"Woe unto them that laugh now!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDid he himself find no cause for laughter on the earth? Then he sought\\r\\nbadly. A child even findeth cause for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe--did not love sufficiently: otherwise would he also have loved\\r\\nus, the laughing ones! But he hated and hooted us; wailing and\\r\\nteeth-gnashing did he promise us.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust one then curse immediately, when one doth not love? That--seemeth\\r\\nto me bad taste. Thus did he, however, this absolute one. He sprang from\\r\\nthe populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he himself just did not love sufficiently; otherwise would he have\\r\\nraged less because people did not love him. All great love doth not SEEK\\r\\nlove:--it seeketh more.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo out of the way of all such absolute ones! They are a poor sickly\\r\\ntype, a populace-type: they look at this life with ill-will, they have\\r\\nan evil eye for this earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo out of the way of all such absolute ones! They have heavy feet and\\r\\nsultry hearts:--they do not know how to dance. How could the earth be\\r\\nlight to such ones!\\r\\n\\r\\n17.\\r\\n\\r\\nTortuously do all good things come nigh to their goal. Like cats\\r\\nthey curve their backs, they purr inwardly with their approaching\\r\\nhappiness,--all good things laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis step betrayeth whether a person already walketh on HIS OWN path:\\r\\njust see me walk! He, however, who cometh nigh to his goal, danceth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, a statue have I not become, not yet do I stand there stiff,\\r\\nstupid and stony, like a pillar; I love fast racing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though there be on earth fens and dense afflictions, he who hath\\r\\nlight feet runneth even across the mud, and danceth, as upon well-swept\\r\\nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nLift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not forget your\\r\\nlegs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and better still, if ye\\r\\nstand upon your heads!\\r\\n\\r\\n18.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown: I myself have put\\r\\non this crown, I myself have consecrated my laughter. No one else have I\\r\\nfound to-day potent enough for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one, who beckoneth with\\r\\nhis pinions, one ready for flight, beckoning unto all birds, ready and\\r\\nprepared, a blissfully light-spirited one:--\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher, no impatient\\r\\none, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps and side-leaps; I myself have\\r\\nput on this crown!\\r\\n\\r\\n19.\\r\\n\\r\\nLift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do not forget your\\r\\nlegs! Lift up also your legs, ye good dancers, and better still if ye\\r\\nstand upon your heads!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also heavy animals in a state of happiness, there are\\r\\nclub-footed ones from the beginning. Curiously do they exert themselves,\\r\\nlike an elephant which endeavoureth to stand upon its head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter, however, to be foolish with happiness than foolish with\\r\\nmisfortune, better to dance awkwardly than walk lamely. So learn, I\\r\\npray you, my wisdom, ye higher men: even the worst thing hath two good\\r\\nreverse sides,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Even the worst thing hath good dancing-legs: so learn, I pray you, ye\\r\\nhigher men, to put yourselves on your proper legs!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo unlearn, I pray you, the sorrow-sighing, and all the\\r\\npopulace-sadness! Oh, how sad the buffoons of the populace seem to me\\r\\nto-day! This to-day, however, is that of the populace.\\r\\n\\r\\n20.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo like unto the wind when it rusheth forth from its mountain-caves:\\r\\nunto its own piping will it dance; the seas tremble and leap under its\\r\\nfootsteps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat which giveth wings to asses, that which milketh the lionesses:--\\r\\npraised be that good, unruly spirit, which cometh like a hurricane unto\\r\\nall the present and unto all the populace,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Which is hostile to thistle-heads and puzzle-heads, and to all\\r\\nwithered leaves and weeds:--praised be this wild, good, free spirit of\\r\\nthe storm, which danceth upon fens and afflictions, as upon meadows!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich hateth the consumptive populace-dogs, and all the ill-constituted,\\r\\nsullen brood:--praised be this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing\\r\\nstorm, which bloweth dust into the eyes of all the melanopic and\\r\\nmelancholic!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, the worst thing in you is that ye have none of you\\r\\nlearned to dance as ye ought to dance--to dance beyond yourselves! What\\r\\ndoth it matter that ye have failed!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow many things are still possible! So LEARN to laugh beyond yourselves!\\r\\nLift up your hearts, ye good dancers, high! higher! And do not forget\\r\\nthe good laughter!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown: to you my brethren\\r\\ndo I cast this crown! Laughing have I consecrated; ye higher men, LEARN,\\r\\nI pray you--to laugh!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIV. THE SONG OF MELANCHOLY.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Zarathustra spake these sayings, he stood nigh to the entrance of\\r\\nhis cave; with the last words, however, he slipped away from his guests,\\r\\nand fled for a little while into the open air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O pure odours around me,\" cried he, \"O blessed stillness around me! But\\r\\nwhere are mine animals? Hither, hither, mine eagle and my serpent!\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me, mine animals: these higher men, all of them--do they perhaps\\r\\nnot SMELL well? O pure odours around me! Now only do I know and feel how\\r\\nI love you, mine animals.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--And Zarathustra said once more: \"I love you, mine animals!\" The eagle,\\r\\nhowever, and the serpent pressed close to him when he spake these\\r\\nwords, and looked up to him. In this attitude were they all three silent\\r\\ntogether, and sniffed and sipped the good air with one another. For the\\r\\nair here outside was better than with the higher men.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly, however, had Zarathustra left the cave when the old magician got\\r\\nup, looked cunningly about him, and said: \"He is gone!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd already, ye higher men--let me tickle you with this complimentary\\r\\nand flattering name, as he himself doeth--already doth mine evil spirit\\r\\nof deceit and magic attack me, my melancholy devil,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Which is an adversary to this Zarathustra from the very heart: forgive\\r\\nit for this! Now doth it wish to conjure before you, it hath just ITS\\r\\nhour; in vain do I struggle with this evil spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnto all of you, whatever honours ye like to assume in your names,\\r\\nwhether ye call yourselves \\'the free spirits\\' or \\'the conscientious,\\'\\r\\nor \\'the penitents of the spirit,\\' or \\'the unfettered,\\' or \\'the great\\r\\nlongers,\\'--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Unto all of you, who like me suffer FROM THE GREAT LOATHING, to\\r\\nwhom the old God hath died, and as yet no new God lieth in cradles and\\r\\nswaddling clothes--unto all of you is mine evil spirit and magic-devil\\r\\nfavourable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know you, ye higher men, I know him,--I know also this fiend whom I\\r\\nlove in spite of me, this Zarathustra: he himself often seemeth to me\\r\\nlike the beautiful mask of a saint,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Like a new strange mummery in which mine evil spirit, the melancholy\\r\\ndevil, delighteth:--I love Zarathustra, so doth it often seem to me, for\\r\\nthe sake of mine evil spirit.--\\r\\n\\r\\nBut already doth IT attack me and constrain me, this spirit of\\r\\nmelancholy, this evening-twilight devil: and verily, ye higher men, it\\r\\nhath a longing--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Open your eyes!--it hath a longing to come NAKED, whether male or\\r\\nfemale, I do not yet know: but it cometh, it constraineth me, alas! open\\r\\nyour wits!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day dieth out, unto all things cometh now the evening, also unto\\r\\nthe best things; hear now, and see, ye higher men, what devil--man or\\r\\nwoman--this spirit of evening-melancholy is!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the old magician, looked cunningly about him, and then seized\\r\\nhis harp.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In evening\\'s limpid air,\\r\\n     What time the dew\\'s soothings\\r\\n     Unto the earth downpour,\\r\\n     Invisibly and unheard--\\r\\n     For tender shoe-gear wear\\r\\n     The soothing dews, like all that\\'s kind-gentle--:\\r\\n     Bethinkst thou then, bethinkst thou, burning heart,\\r\\n     How once thou thirstedest\\r\\n     For heaven\\'s kindly teardrops and dew\\'s down-droppings,\\r\\n     All singed and weary thirstedest,\\r\\n     What time on yellow grass-pathways\\r\\n     Wicked, occidental sunny glances\\r\\n     Through sombre trees about thee sported,\\r\\n     Blindingly sunny glow-glances, gladly-hurting?\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Of TRUTH the wooer?

SCIENCE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus sang the magician; and all who were present went like birds\\r\\nunawares into the net of his artful and melancholy voluptuousness.\\r\\nOnly the spiritually conscientious one had not been caught: he at once\\r\\nsnatched the harp from the magician and called out: \"Air! Let in good\\r\\nair! Let in Zarathustra! Thou makest this cave sultry and poisonous,\\r\\nthou bad old magician!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou seducest, thou false one, thou subtle one, to unknown desires and\\r\\ndeserts. And alas, that such as thou should talk and make ado about the\\r\\nTRUTH!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, to all free spirits who are not on their guard against SUCH\\r\\nmagicians! It is all over with their freedom: thou teachest and temptest\\r\\nback into prisons,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Thou old melancholy devil, out of thy lament soundeth a lurement: thou\\r\\nresemblest those who with their praise of chastity secretly invite to\\r\\nvoluptuousness!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the conscientious one; the old magician, however, looked\\r\\nabout him, enjoying his triumph, and on that account put up with the\\r\\nannoyance which the conscientious one caused him. \"Be still!\" said he\\r\\nwith modest voice, \"good songs want to re-echo well; after good songs\\r\\none should be long silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus do all those present, the higher men. Thou, however, hast perhaps\\r\\nunderstood but little of my song? In thee there is little of the magic\\r\\nspirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou praisest me,\" replied the conscientious one, \"in that thou\\r\\nseparatest me from thyself; very well! But, ye others, what do I see? Ye\\r\\nstill sit there, all of you, with lusting eyes--:\\r\\n\\r\\nYe free spirits, whither hath your freedom gone! Ye almost seem to me\\r\\nto resemble those who have long looked at bad girls dancing naked: your\\r\\nsouls themselves dance!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn you, ye higher men, there must be more of that which the magician\\r\\ncalleth his evil spirit of magic and deceit:--we must indeed be\\r\\ndifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd verily, we spake and thought long enough together ere Zarathustra\\r\\ncame home to his cave, for me not to be unaware that we ARE different.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe SEEK different things even here aloft, ye and I. For I seek more\\r\\nSECURITY; on that account have I come to Zarathustra. For he is still\\r\\nthe most steadfast tower and will--\\r\\n\\r\\n--To-day, when everything tottereth, when all the earth quaketh. Ye,\\r\\nhowever, when I see what eyes ye make, it almost seemeth to me that ye\\r\\nseek MORE INSECURITY,\\r\\n\\r\\n--More horror, more danger, more earthquake. Ye long (it almost seemeth\\r\\nso to me--forgive my presumption, ye higher men)--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ye long for the worst and dangerousest life, which frighteneth ME\\r\\nmost,--for the life of wild beasts, for forests, caves, steep mountains\\r\\nand labyrinthine gorges.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is not those who lead OUT OF danger that please you best, but\\r\\nthose who lead you away from all paths, the misleaders. But if\\r\\nsuch longing in you be ACTUAL, it seemeth to me nevertheless to be\\r\\nIMPOSSIBLE.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor fear--that is man\\'s original and fundamental feeling; through fear\\r\\neverything is explained, original sin and original virtue. Through fear\\r\\nthere grew also MY virtue, that is to say: Science.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor fear of wild animals--that hath been longest fostered in\\r\\nman, inclusive of the animal which he concealeth and feareth in\\r\\nhimself:--Zarathustra calleth it \\'the beast inside.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch prolonged ancient fear, at last become subtle, spiritual and\\r\\nintellectual--at present, me thinketh, it is called SCIENCE.\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the conscientious one; but Zarathustra, who had just come\\r\\nback into his cave and had heard and divined the last discourse, threw a\\r\\nhandful of roses to the conscientious one, and laughed on account of\\r\\nhis \"truths.\" \"Why!\" he exclaimed, \"what did I hear just now? Verily, it\\r\\nseemeth to me, thou art a fool, or else I myself am one: and quietly and\\r\\nquickly will I put thy \\'truth\\' upside down.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor FEAR--is an exception with us. Courage, however, and adventure, and\\r\\ndelight in the uncertain, in the unattempted--COURAGE seemeth to me the\\r\\nentire primitive history of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wildest and most courageous animals hath he envied and robbed of all\\r\\ntheir virtues: thus only did he become--man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS courage, at last become subtle, spiritual and intellectual, this\\r\\nhuman courage, with eagle\\'s pinions and serpent\\'s wisdom: THIS, it\\r\\nseemeth to me, is called at present--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"ZARATHUSTRA!\" cried all of them there assembled, as if with one voice,\\r\\nand burst out at the same time into a great laughter; there arose,\\r\\nhowever, from them as it were a heavy cloud. Even the magician laughed,\\r\\nand said wisely: \"Well! It is gone, mine evil spirit!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd did I not myself warn you against it when I said that it was a\\r\\ndeceiver, a lying and deceiving spirit?\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially when it showeth itself naked. But what can _I_ do with regard\\r\\nto its tricks! Have _I_ created it and the world?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! Let us be good again, and of good cheer! And although Zarathustra\\r\\nlooketh with evil eye--just see him! he disliketh me--:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ere night cometh will he again learn to love and laud me; he cannot\\r\\nlive long without committing such follies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHE--loveth his enemies: this art knoweth he better than any one I have\\r\\nseen. But he taketh revenge for it--on his friends!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the old magician, and the higher men applauded him; so that\\r\\nZarathustra went round, and mischievously and lovingly shook hands with\\r\\nhis friends,--like one who hath to make amends and apologise to every\\r\\none for something. When however he had thereby come to the door of his\\r\\ncave, lo, then had he again a longing for the good air outside, and for\\r\\nhis animals,--and wished to steal out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXVI. AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Go not away!\" said then the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra\\'s\\r\\nshadow, \"abide with us--otherwise the old gloomy affliction might again\\r\\nfall upon us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow hath that old magician given us of his worst for our good, and\\r\\nlo! the good, pious pope there hath tears in his eyes, and hath quite\\r\\nembarked again upon the sea of melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose kings may well put on a good air before us still: for that have\\r\\nTHEY learned best of us all at present! Had they however no one to see\\r\\nthem, I wager that with them also the bad game would again commence,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The bad game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy, of curtained\\r\\nheavens, of stolen suns, of howling autumn-winds,\\r\\n\\r\\n--The bad game of our howling and crying for help! Abide with us, O\\r\\nZarathustra! Here there is much concealed misery that wisheth to speak,\\r\\nmuch evening, much cloud, much damp air!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou hast nourished us with strong food for men, and powerful proverbs:\\r\\ndo not let the weakly, womanly spirits attack us anew at dessert!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou alone makest the air around thee strong and clear! Did I ever find\\r\\nanywhere on earth such good air as with thee in thy cave?\\r\\n\\r\\nMany lands have I seen, my nose hath learned to test and estimate many\\r\\nkinds of air: but with thee do my nostrils taste their greatest delight!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless it be,--unless it be--, do forgive an old recollection! Forgive\\r\\nme an old after-dinner song, which I once composed amongst daughters of\\r\\nthe desert:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFor with them was there equally good, clear, Oriental air; there was I\\r\\nfurthest from cloudy, damp, melancholy Old-Europe!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen did I love such Oriental maidens and other blue kingdoms of heaven,\\r\\nover which hang no clouds and no thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe would not believe how charmingly they sat there, when they did\\r\\nnot dance, profound, but without thoughts, like little secrets, like\\r\\nberibboned riddles, like dessert-nuts--\\r\\n\\r\\nMany-hued and foreign, forsooth! but without clouds: riddles which\\r\\ncan be guessed: to please such maidens I then composed an after-dinner\\r\\npsalm.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra\\'s shadow; and\\r\\nbefore any one answered him, he had seized the harp of the old magician,\\r\\ncrossed his legs, and looked calmly and sagely around him:--with his\\r\\nnostrils, however, he inhaled the air slowly and questioningly, like one\\r\\nwho in new countries tasteth new foreign air. Afterward he began to sing\\r\\nwith a kind of roaring.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DESERTS GROW: WOE HIM WHO DOTH THEM HIDE!\\r\\n\\r\\n     --Ha!\\r\\n     Solemnly!\\r\\n     In effect solemnly!\\r\\n     A worthy beginning!\\r\\n     Afric manner, solemnly!\\r\\n     Of a lion worthy,\\r\\n     Or perhaps of a virtuous howl-monkey--\\r\\n     --But it\\'s naught to you,\\r\\n     Ye friendly damsels dearly loved,\\r\\n     At whose own feet to me,\\r\\n     The first occasion,\\r\\n     To a European under palm-trees,\\r\\n     A seat is now granted.

Selah.\\r\\n\\r\\n     To the there-named south-fruits now,\\r\\n     Similar, all-too-similar,\\r\\n     Do I lie here; by little\\r\\n     Flying insects\\r\\n     Round-sniffled and round-played,\\r\\n     And also by yet littler,\\r\\n     Foolisher, and peccabler\\r\\n     Wishes and phantasies,--\\r\\n     Environed by you,\\r\\n     Ye silent, presentientest\\r\\n     Maiden-kittens,\\r\\n     Dudu and Suleika,\\r\\n     --ROUNDSPHINXED, that into one word\\r\\n     I may crowd much feeling:\\r\\n     (Forgive me, O God,\\r\\n     All such speech-sinning!)\\r\\n     --Sit I here the best of air sniffling,\\r\\n     Paradisal air, truly,\\r\\n     Bright and buoyant air, golden-mottled,\\r\\n     As goodly air as ever\\r\\n     From lunar orb downfell--\\r\\n     Be it by hazard,\\r\\n     Or supervened it by arrogancy?\\r\\n     As the ancient poets relate it.\\r\\n     But doubter, I\\'m now calling it\\r\\n     In question:  with this do I come indeed\\r\\n     Out of Europe,\\r\\n     That doubt\\'th more eagerly than doth any\\r\\n     Elderly married woman.\\r\\n     May the Lord improve it!\\r\\n     Amen.\\r\\n\\r\\n     This the finest air drinking,\\r\\n     With nostrils out-swelled like goblets,\\r\\n     Lacking future, lacking remembrances\\r\\n     Thus do I sit here, ye\\r\\n     Friendly damsels dearly loved,\\r\\n     And look at the palm-tree there,\\r\\n     How it, to a dance-girl, like,\\r\\n     Doth bow and bend and on its haunches bob,\\r\\n     --One doth it too, when one view\\'th it long!--\\r\\n     To a dance-girl like, who as it seem\\'th to me,\\r\\n     Too long, and dangerously persistent,\\r\\n     Always, always, just on SINGLE leg hath stood?\\r\\n     --Then forgot she thereby, as it seem\\'th to me,\\r\\n     The OTHER leg?\\r\\n     For vainly I, at least,\\r\\n     Did search for the amissing\\r\\n     Fellow-jewel\\r\\n     --Namely, the other leg--\\r\\n     In the sanctified precincts,\\r\\n     Nigh her very dearest, very tenderest,\\r\\n     Flapping and fluttering and flickering skirting.\\r\\n     Yea, if ye should, ye beauteous friendly ones,\\r\\n     Quite take my word:\\r\\n     She hath, alas!

THE AWAKENING.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the song of the wanderer and shadow, the cave became all at once\\r\\nfull of noise and laughter: and since the assembled guests all spake\\r\\nsimultaneously, and even the ass, encouraged thereby, no longer\\r\\nremained silent, a little aversion and scorn for his visitors came over\\r\\nZarathustra, although he rejoiced at their gladness. For it seemed to\\r\\nhim a sign of convalescence. So he slipped out into the open air and\\r\\nspake to his animals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whither hath their distress now gone?\" said he, and already did he\\r\\nhimself feel relieved of his petty disgust--\"with me, it seemeth that\\r\\nthey have unlearned their cries of distress!\\r\\n\\r\\n--Though, alas! not yet their crying.\" And Zarathustra stopped his\\r\\nears, for just then did the YE-A of the ass mix strangely with the noisy\\r\\njubilation of those higher men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They are merry,\" he began again, \"and who knoweth? perhaps at their\\r\\nhost\\'s expense; and if they have learned of me to laugh, still it is not\\r\\nMY laughter they have learned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what matter about that! They are old people: they recover in their\\r\\nown way, they laugh in their own way; mine ears have already endured\\r\\nworse and have not become peevish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis day is a victory: he already yieldeth, he fleeth, THE SPIRIT OF\\r\\nGRAVITY, mine old arch-enemy! How well this day is about to end, which\\r\\nbegan so badly and gloomily!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is ABOUT TO end. Already cometh the evening: over the sea\\r\\nrideth it hither, the good rider! How it bobbeth, the blessed one, the\\r\\nhome-returning one, in its purple saddles!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sky gazeth brightly thereon, the world lieth deep. Oh, all ye\\r\\nstrange ones who have come to me, it is already worth while to have\\r\\nlived with me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra. And again came the cries and laughter of the\\r\\nhigher men out of the cave: then began he anew:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They bite at it, my bait taketh, there departeth also from them their\\r\\nenemy, the spirit of gravity. Now do they learn to laugh at themselves:\\r\\ndo I hear rightly?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy virile food taketh effect, my strong and savoury sayings: and verily,\\r\\nI did not nourish them with flatulent vegetables! But with warrior-food,\\r\\nwith conqueror-food: new desires did I awaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew hopes are in their arms and legs, their hearts expand. They find new\\r\\nwords, soon will their spirits breathe wantonness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch food may sure enough not be proper for children, nor even for\\r\\nlonging girls old and young. One persuadeth their bowels otherwise; I am\\r\\nnot their physician and teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DISGUST departeth from these higher men; well! that is my victory.\\r\\nIn my domain they become assured; all stupid shame fleeth away; they\\r\\nempty themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey empty their hearts, good times return unto them, they keep holiday\\r\\nand ruminate,--they become THANKFUL.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHAT do I take as the best sign: they become thankful. Not long will it\\r\\nbe ere they devise festivals, and put up memorials to their old joys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are CONVALESCENTS!\" Thus spake Zarathustra joyfully to his heart\\r\\nand gazed outward; his animals, however, pressed up to him, and honoured\\r\\nhis happiness and his silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll on a sudden however, Zarathustra\\'s ear was frightened: for the cave\\r\\nwhich had hitherto been full of noise and laughter, became all at once\\r\\nstill as death;--his nose, however, smelt a sweet-scented vapour and\\r\\nincense-odour, as if from burning pine-cones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What happeneth? What are they about?\" he asked himself, and stole up\\r\\nto the entrance, that he might be able unobserved to see his guests.\\r\\nBut wonder upon wonder! what was he then obliged to behold with his own\\r\\neyes!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"They have all of them become PIOUS again, they PRAY, they are\\r\\nmad!\"--said he, and was astonished beyond measure. And forsooth! all\\r\\nthese higher men, the two kings, the pope out of service, the evil\\r\\nmagician, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer and shadow, the old\\r\\nsoothsayer, the spiritually conscientious one, and the ugliest man--they\\r\\nall lay on their knees like children and credulous old women, and\\r\\nworshipped the ass. And just then began the ugliest man to gurgle and\\r\\nsnort, as if something unutterable in him tried to find expression;\\r\\nwhen, however, he had actually found words, behold! it was a pious,\\r\\nstrange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass. And the litany\\r\\nsounded thus:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmen! And glory and honour and wisdom and thanks and praise and strength\\r\\nbe to our God, from everlasting to everlasting!\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe carrieth our burdens, he hath taken upon him the form of a servant,\\r\\nhe is patient of heart and never saith Nay; and he who loveth his God\\r\\nchastiseth him.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe speaketh not: except that he ever saith Yea to the world which\\r\\nhe created: thus doth he extol his world. It is his artfulness that\\r\\nspeaketh not: thus is he rarely found wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncomely goeth he through the world. Grey is the favourite colour in\\r\\nwhich he wrappeth his virtue. Hath he spirit, then doth he conceal it;\\r\\nevery one, however, believeth in his long ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat hidden wisdom it is to wear long ears, and only to say Yea and\\r\\nnever Nay! Hath he not created the world in his own image, namely, as\\r\\nstupid as possible?\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou goest straight and crooked ways; it concerneth thee little what\\r\\nseemeth straight or crooked unto us men. Beyond good and evil is thy\\r\\ndomain. It is thine innocence not to know what innocence is.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nLo! how thou spurnest none from thee, neither beggars nor kings. Thou\\r\\nsufferest little children to come unto thee, and when the bad boys decoy\\r\\nthee, then sayest thou simply, YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou lovest she-asses and fresh figs, thou art no food-despiser. A\\r\\nthistle tickleth thy heart when thou chancest to be hungry. There is the\\r\\nwisdom of a God therein.\\r\\n\\r\\n--The ass, however, here brayed YE-A.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXVIII. THE ASS-FESTIVAL.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this place in the litany, however, Zarathustra could no longer\\r\\ncontrol himself; he himself cried out YE-A, louder even than the ass,\\r\\nand sprang into the midst of his maddened guests. \"Whatever are you\\r\\nabout, ye grown-up children?\" he exclaimed, pulling up the praying ones\\r\\nfrom the ground. \"Alas, if any one else, except Zarathustra, had seen\\r\\nyou:\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one would think you the worst blasphemers, or the very foolishest\\r\\nold women, with your new belief!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thou thyself, thou old pope, how is it in accordance with thee, to\\r\\nadore an ass in such a manner as God?\"--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" answered the pope, \"forgive me, but in divine matters\\r\\nI am more enlightened even than thou. And it is right that it should be\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetter to adore God so, in this form, than in no form at all! Think over\\r\\nthis saying, mine exalted friend: thou wilt readily divine that in such\\r\\na saying there is wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who said \\'God is a Spirit\\'--made the greatest stride and slide\\r\\nhitherto made on earth towards unbelief: such a dictum is not easily\\r\\namended again on earth!\\r\\n\\r\\nMine old heart leapeth and boundeth because there is still something\\r\\nto adore on earth. Forgive it, O Zarathustra, to an old, pious\\r\\npontiff-heart!--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"And thou,\" said Zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow, \"thou callest\\r\\nand thinkest thyself a free spirit? And thou here practisest such\\r\\nidolatry and hierolatry?\\r\\n\\r\\nWorse verily, doest thou here than with thy bad brown girls, thou bad,\\r\\nnew believer!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is sad enough,\" answered the wanderer and shadow, \"thou art right:\\r\\nbut how can I help it! The old God liveth again, O Zarathustra, thou\\r\\nmayst say what thou wilt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ugliest man is to blame for it all: he hath reawakened him. And\\r\\nif he say that he once killed him, with Gods DEATH is always just a\\r\\nprejudice.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"And thou,\" said Zarathustra, \"thou bad old magician, what didst thou\\r\\ndo! Who ought to believe any longer in thee in this free age, when THOU\\r\\nbelievest in such divine donkeyism?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a stupid thing that thou didst; how couldst thou, a shrewd man,\\r\\ndo such a stupid thing!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" answered the shrewd magician, \"thou art right, it was a\\r\\nstupid thing,--it was also repugnant to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"And thou even,\" said Zarathustra to the spiritually conscientious\\r\\none, \"consider, and put thy finger to thy nose! Doth nothing go against\\r\\nthy conscience here? Is thy spirit not too cleanly for this praying and\\r\\nthe fumes of those devotees?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is something therein,\" said the spiritually conscientious one,\\r\\nand put his finger to his nose, \"there is something in this spectacle\\r\\nwhich even doeth good to my conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps I dare not believe in God: certain it is however, that God\\r\\nseemeth to me most worthy of belief in this form.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is said to be eternal, according to the testimony of the most pious:\\r\\nhe who hath so much time taketh his time. As slow and as stupid as\\r\\npossible: THEREBY can such a one nevertheless go very far.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he who hath too much spirit might well become infatuated with\\r\\nstupidity and folly. Think of thyself, O Zarathustra!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou thyself--verily! even thou couldst well become an ass through\\r\\nsuperabundance of wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoth not the true sage willingly walk on the crookedest paths? The\\r\\nevidence teacheth it, O Zarathustra,--THINE OWN evidence!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--\"And thou thyself, finally,\" said Zarathustra, and turned towards the\\r\\nugliest man, who still lay on the ground stretching up his arm to the\\r\\nass (for he gave it wine to drink). \"Say, thou nondescript, what hast\\r\\nthou been about!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou seemest to me transformed, thine eyes glow, the mantle of the\\r\\nsublime covereth thine ugliness: WHAT didst thou do?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it then true what they say, that thou hast again awakened him? And\\r\\nwhy? Was he not for good reasons killed and made away with?\\r\\n\\r\\nThou thyself seemest to me awakened: what didst thou do? why didst THOU\\r\\nturn round? Why didst THOU get converted? Speak, thou nondescript!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O Zarathustra,\" answered the ugliest man, \"thou art a rogue!\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether HE yet liveth, or again liveth, or is thoroughly dead--which of\\r\\nus both knoweth that best? I ask thee.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing however do I know,--from thyself did I learn it once, O\\r\\nZarathustra: he who wanteth to kill most thoroughly, LAUGHETH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Not by wrath but by laughter doth one kill\\'--thus spakest thou once,\\r\\nO Zarathustra, thou hidden one, thou destroyer without wrath, thou\\r\\ndangerous saint,--thou art a rogue!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, however, did it come to pass that Zarathustra, astonished at such\\r\\nmerely roguish answers, jumped back to the door of his cave, and turning\\r\\ntowards all his guests, cried out with a strong voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"O ye wags, all of you, ye buffoons! Why do ye dissemble and disguise\\r\\nyourselves before me!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and wickedness,\\r\\nbecause ye had at last become again like little children--namely,\\r\\npious,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Because ye at last did again as children do--namely, prayed, folded\\r\\nyour hands and said \\'good God\\'!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now leave, I pray you, THIS nursery, mine own cave, where to-day\\r\\nall childishness is carried on. Cool down, here outside, your hot\\r\\nchild-wantonness and heart-tumult!\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure: except ye become as little children ye shall not enter into\\r\\nTHAT kingdom of heaven.\" (And Zarathustra pointed aloft with his hands.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But we do not at all want to enter into the kingdom of heaven: we have\\r\\nbecome men,--SO WE WANT THE KINGDOM OF EARTH.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd once more began Zarathustra to speak. \"O my new friends,\" said he,--\\r\\n\"ye strange ones, ye higher men, how well do ye now please me,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Since ye have again become joyful! Ye have, verily, all blossomed\\r\\nforth: it seemeth to me that for such flowers as you, NEW FESTIVALS are\\r\\nrequired.\\r\\n\\r\\n--A little valiant nonsense, some divine service and ass-festival, some\\r\\nold joyful Zarathustra fool, some blusterer to blow your souls bright.\\r\\n\\r\\nForget not this night and this ass-festival, ye higher men! THAT did ye\\r\\ndevise when with me, that do I take as a good omen,--such things only\\r\\nthe convalescents devise!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd should ye celebrate it again, this ass-festival, do it from love to\\r\\nyourselves, do it also from love to me! And in remembrance of me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXIX. THE DRUNKEN SONG.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile one after another had gone out into the open air, and into the\\r\\ncool, thoughtful night; Zarathustra himself, however, led the ugliest\\r\\nman by the hand, that he might show him his night-world, and the great\\r\\nround moon, and the silvery water-falls near his cave. There they at\\r\\nlast stood still beside one another; all of them old people, but with\\r\\ncomforted, brave hearts, and astonished in themselves that it was so\\r\\nwell with them on earth; the mystery of the night, however, came nigher\\r\\nand nigher to their hearts. And anew Zarathustra thought to himself:\\r\\n\"Oh, how well do they now please me, these higher men!\"--but he did not\\r\\nsay it aloud, for he respected their happiness and their silence.--\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, however, there happened that which in this astonishing long day\\r\\nwas most astonishing: the ugliest man began once more and for the last\\r\\ntime to gurgle and snort, and when he had at length found expression,\\r\\nbehold! there sprang a question plump and plain out of his mouth, a\\r\\ngood, deep, clear question, which moved the hearts of all who listened\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My friends, all of you,\" said the ugliest man, \"what think ye? For the\\r\\nsake of this day--_I_ am for the first time content to have lived mine\\r\\nentire life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that I testify so much is still not enough for me. It is worth while\\r\\nliving on the earth: one day, one festival with Zarathustra, hath taught\\r\\nme to love the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'Was THAT--life?\\' will I say unto death. \\'Well! Once more!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friends, what think ye? Will ye not, like me, say unto death: \\'Was\\r\\nTHAT--life? For the sake of Zarathustra, well! Once more!\\'\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake the ugliest man; it was not, however, far from midnight.\\r\\nAnd what took place then, think ye? As soon as the higher men heard his\\r\\nquestion, they became all at once conscious of their transformation and\\r\\nconvalescence, and of him who was the cause thereof: then did they rush\\r\\nup to Zarathustra, thanking, honouring, caressing him, and kissing his\\r\\nhands, each in his own peculiar way; so that some laughed and some wept.\\r\\nThe old soothsayer, however, danced with delight; and though he was\\r\\nthen, as some narrators suppose, full of sweet wine, he was certainly\\r\\nstill fuller of sweet life, and had renounced all weariness. There are\\r\\neven those who narrate that the ass then danced: for not in vain had the\\r\\nugliest man previously given it wine to drink. That may be the case, or\\r\\nit may be otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening,\\r\\nthere nevertheless happened then greater and rarer wonders than\\r\\nthe dancing of an ass would have been. In short, as the proverb of\\r\\nZarathustra saith: \"What doth it matter!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, this took place with the ugliest man, Zarathustra stood\\r\\nthere like one drunken: his glance dulled, his tongue faltered and his\\r\\nfeet staggered. And who could divine what thoughts then passed through\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s soul? Apparently, however, his spirit retreated and fled\\r\\nin advance and was in remote distances, and as it were \"wandering on\\r\\nhigh mountain-ridges,\" as it standeth written, \"\\'twixt two seas,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Wandering \\'twixt the past and the future as a heavy cloud.\" Gradually,\\r\\nhowever, while the higher men held him in their arms, he came back to\\r\\nhimself a little, and resisted with his hands the crowd of the honouring\\r\\nand caring ones; but he did not speak. All at once, however, he turned\\r\\nhis head quickly, for he seemed to hear something: then laid he his\\r\\nfinger on his mouth and said: \"COME!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd immediately it became still and mysterious round about; from\\r\\nthe depth however there came up slowly the sound of a clock-bell.\\r\\nZarathustra listened thereto, like the higher men; then, however, laid\\r\\nhe his finger on his mouth the second time, and said again: \"COME! COME!\\r\\nIT IS GETTING ON TO MIDNIGHT!\"--and his voice had changed. But still\\r\\nhe had not moved from the spot. Then it became yet stiller and more\\r\\nmysterious, and everything hearkened, even the ass, and Zarathustra\\'s\\r\\nnoble animals, the eagle and the serpent,--likewise the cave of\\r\\nZarathustra and the big cool moon, and the night itself. Zarathustra,\\r\\nhowever, laid his hand upon his mouth for the third time, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\nCOME! COME! COME! LET US NOW WANDER! IT IS THE HOUR: LET US WANDER INTO\\r\\nTHE NIGHT!\\r\\n\\r\\n3.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, it is getting on to midnight: then will I say something\\r\\ninto your ears, as that old clock-bell saith it into mine ear,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--As mysteriously, as frightfully, and as cordially as that midnight\\r\\nclock-bell speaketh it to me, which hath experienced more than one man:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Which hath already counted the smarting throbbings of your fathers\\'\\r\\nhearts--ah! ah! how it sigheth! how it laugheth in its dream! the old,\\r\\ndeep, deep midnight!\\r\\n\\r\\nHush! Hush! Then is there many a thing heard which may not be heard\\r\\nby day; now however, in the cool air, when even all the tumult of your\\r\\nhearts hath become still,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Now doth it speak, now is it heard, now doth it steal into\\r\\noverwakeful, nocturnal souls: ah! ah! how the midnight sigheth! how it\\r\\nlaugheth in its dream!\\r\\n\\r\\n--Hearest thou not how it mysteriously, frightfully, and cordially\\r\\nspeaketh unto THEE, the old deep, deep midnight?\\r\\n\\r\\nO MAN, TAKE HEED!\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoe to me! Whither hath time gone? Have I not sunk into deep wells? The\\r\\nworld sleepeth--\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! Ah! The dog howleth, the moon shineth. Rather will I die, rather\\r\\nwill I die, than say unto you what my midnight-heart now thinketh.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready have I died. It is all over. Spider, why spinnest thou around\\r\\nme? Wilt thou have blood? Ah! Ah! The dew falleth, the hour cometh--\\r\\n\\r\\n--The hour in which I frost and freeze, which asketh and asketh and\\r\\nasketh: \"Who hath sufficient courage for it?\\r\\n\\r\\n--Who is to be master of the world? Who is going to say: THUS shall ye\\r\\nflow, ye great and small streams!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--The hour approacheth: O man, thou higher man, take heed! this talk is\\r\\nfor fine ears, for thine ears--WHAT SAITH DEEP MIDNIGHT\\'S VOICE INDEED?\\r\\n\\r\\n5.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt carrieth me away, my soul danceth. Day\\'s-work! Day\\'s-work! Who is to\\r\\nbe master of the world?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moon is cool, the wind is still. Ah! Ah! Have ye already flown high\\r\\nenough? Ye have danced: a leg, nevertheless, is not a wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe good dancers, now is all delight over: wine hath become lees, every\\r\\ncup hath become brittle, the sepulchres mutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe have not flown high enough: now do the sepulchres mutter: \"Free the\\r\\ndead! Why is it so long night? Doth not the moon make us drunken?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, free the sepulchres, awaken the corpses! Ah, why doth the\\r\\nworm still burrow? There approacheth, there approacheth, the hour,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--There boometh the clock-bell, there thrilleth still the heart, there\\r\\nburroweth still the wood-worm, the heart-worm. Ah! Ah! THE WORLD IS\\r\\nDEEP!\\r\\n\\r\\n6.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love thy tone, thy drunken, ranunculine\\r\\ntone!--how long, how far hath come unto me thy tone, from the distance,\\r\\nfrom the ponds of love!\\r\\n\\r\\nThou old clock-bell, thou sweet lyre! Every pain hath torn thy heart,\\r\\nfather-pain, fathers\\'-pain, forefathers\\'-pain; thy speech hath become\\r\\nripe,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ripe like the golden autumn and the afternoon, like mine anchorite\\r\\nheart--now sayest thou: The world itself hath become ripe, the grape\\r\\nturneth brown,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Now doth it wish to die, to die of happiness. Ye higher men, do ye not\\r\\nfeel it? There welleth up mysteriously an odour,\\r\\n\\r\\n--A perfume and odour of eternity, a rosy-blessed, brown,\\r\\ngold-wine-odour of old happiness,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Of drunken midnight-death happiness, which singeth: the world is deep,\\r\\nAND DEEPER THAN THE DAY COULD READ!\\r\\n\\r\\n7.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeave me alone! Leave me alone! I am too pure for thee. Touch me not!\\r\\nHath not my world just now become perfect?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy skin is too pure for thy hands. Leave me alone, thou dull, doltish,\\r\\nstupid day! Is not the midnight brighter?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purest are to be masters of the world, the least known, the\\r\\nstrongest, the midnight-souls, who are brighter and deeper than any day.\\r\\n\\r\\nO day, thou gropest for me? Thou feelest for my happiness? For thee am I\\r\\nrich, lonesome, a treasure-pit, a gold chamber?\\r\\n\\r\\nO world, thou wantest ME? Am I worldly for thee? Am I spiritual for\\r\\nthee? Am I divine for thee? But day and world, ye are too coarse,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Have cleverer hands, grasp after deeper happiness, after deeper\\r\\nunhappiness, grasp after some God; grasp not after me:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Mine unhappiness, my happiness is deep, thou strange day, but yet am I\\r\\nno God, no God\\'s-hell: DEEP IS ITS WOE.\\r\\n\\r\\n8.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod\\'s woe is deeper, thou strange world! Grasp at God\\'s woe, not at me!\\r\\nWhat am I! A drunken sweet lyre,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--A midnight-lyre, a bell-frog, which no one understandeth, but which\\r\\nMUST speak before deaf ones, ye higher men! For ye do not understand me!\\r\\n\\r\\nGone! Gone! O youth! O noontide! O afternoon! Now have come evening and\\r\\nnight and midnight,--the dog howleth, the wind:\\r\\n\\r\\n--Is the wind not a dog? It whineth, it barketh, it howleth. Ah! Ah!\\r\\nhow she sigheth! how she laugheth, how she wheezeth and panteth, the\\r\\nmidnight!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow she just now speaketh soberly, this drunken poetess! hath she\\r\\nperhaps overdrunk her drunkenness? hath she become overawake? doth she\\r\\nruminate?\\r\\n\\r\\n--Her woe doth she ruminate over, in a dream, the old, deep\\r\\nmidnight--and still more her joy. For joy, although woe be deep, JOY IS\\r\\nDEEPER STILL THAN GRIEF CAN BE.\\r\\n\\r\\n9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThou grape-vine! Why dost thou praise me? Have I not cut thee! I am\\r\\ncruel, thou bleedest--: what meaneth thy praise of my drunken cruelty?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Whatever hath become perfect, everything mature--wanteth to die!\" so\\r\\nsayest thou. Blessed, blessed be the vintner\\'s knife! But everything\\r\\nimmature wanteth to live: alas!\\r\\n\\r\\nWoe saith: \"Hence! Go! Away, thou woe!\" But everything that suffereth\\r\\nwanteth to live, that it may become mature and lively and longing,\\r\\n\\r\\n--Longing for the further, the higher, the brighter. \"I want heirs,\"\\r\\nso saith everything that suffereth, \"I want children, I do not want\\r\\nMYSELF,\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nJoy, however, doth not want heirs, it doth not want children,--joy\\r\\nwanteth itself, it wanteth eternity, it wanteth recurrence, it wanteth\\r\\neverything eternally-like-itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWoe saith: \"Break, bleed, thou heart! Wander, thou leg! Thou wing, fly!\\r\\nOnward! upward! thou pain!\" Well! Cheer up! O mine old heart: WOE SAITH:\\r\\n\"HENCE! GO!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n10.\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, what think ye? Am I a soothsayer? Or a dreamer? Or a\\r\\ndrunkard? Or a dream-reader? Or a midnight-bell?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr a drop of dew? Or a fume and fragrance of eternity? Hear ye it not?\\r\\nSmell ye it not? Just now hath my world become perfect, midnight is also\\r\\nmid-day,--\\r\\n\\r\\nPain is also a joy, curse is also a blessing, night is also a sun,--go\\r\\naway! or ye will learn that a sage is also a fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaid ye ever Yea to one joy? O my friends, then said ye Yea also unto\\r\\nALL woe. All things are enlinked, enlaced and enamoured,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Wanted ye ever once to come twice; said ye ever: \"Thou pleasest me,\\r\\nhappiness! Instant! Moment!\" then wanted ye ALL to come back again!\\r\\n\\r\\n--All anew, all eternal, all enlinked, enlaced and enamoured, Oh, then\\r\\ndid ye LOVE the world,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Ye eternal ones, ye love it eternally and for all time: and also unto\\r\\nwoe do ye say: Hence! Go! but come back! FOR JOYS ALL WANT--ETERNITY!\\r\\n\\r\\n11.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll joy wanteth the eternity of all things, it wanteth honey, it\\r\\nwanteth lees, it wanteth drunken midnight, it wanteth graves, it wanteth\\r\\ngrave-tears\\' consolation, it wanteth gilded evening-red--\\r\\n\\r\\n--WHAT doth not joy want! it is thirstier, heartier, hungrier, more\\r\\nfrightful, more mysterious, than all woe: it wanteth ITSELF, it biteth\\r\\ninto ITSELF, the ring\\'s will writheth in it,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--It wanteth love, it wanteth hate, it is over-rich, it bestoweth, it\\r\\nthroweth away, it beggeth for some one to take from it, it thanketh the\\r\\ntaker, it would fain be hated,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--So rich is joy that it thirsteth for woe, for hell, for hate, for\\r\\nshame, for the lame, for the WORLD,--for this world, Oh, ye know it\\r\\nindeed!\\r\\n\\r\\nYe higher men, for you doth it long, this joy, this irrepressible,\\r\\nblessed joy--for your woe, ye failures! For failures, longeth all\\r\\neternal joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor joys all want themselves, therefore do they also want grief! O\\r\\nhappiness, O pain! Oh break, thou heart! Ye higher men, do learn it,\\r\\nthat joys want eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\n--Joys want the eternity of ALL things, they WANT DEEP, PROFOUND\\r\\nETERNITY!\\r\\n\\r\\n12.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave ye now learned my song? Have ye divined what it would say? Well!\\r\\nCheer up! Ye higher men, sing now my roundelay!\\r\\n\\r\\nSing now yourselves the song, the name of which is \"Once more,\" the\\r\\nsignification of which is \"Unto all eternity!\"--sing, ye higher men,\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s roundelay!\\r\\n\\r\\n     O man!  Take heed!\\r\\n     What saith deep midnight\\'s voice indeed?\\r\\n     \"I slept my sleep--,\\r\\n     \"From deepest dream I\\'ve woke, and plead:--\\r\\n     \"The world is deep,\\r\\n     \"And deeper than the day could read.\\r\\n     \"Deep is its woe--,\\r\\n     \"Joy--deeper still than grief can be:\\r\\n     \"Woe saith:  Hence!  Go!\\r\\n     \"But joys all want eternity-,\\r\\n     \"-Want deep, profound eternity!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLXXX. THE SIGN.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, however, after this night, Zarathustra jumped up from\\r\\nhis couch, and, having girded his loins, he came out of his cave glowing\\r\\nand strong, like a morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou great star,\" spake he, as he had spoken once before, \"thou deep\\r\\neye of happiness, what would be all thy happiness if thou hadst not\\r\\nTHOSE for whom thou shinest!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if they remained in their chambers whilst thou art already awake,\\r\\nand comest and bestowest and distributest, how would thy proud modesty\\r\\nupbraid for it!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! they still sleep, these higher men, whilst _I_ am awake: THEY are\\r\\nnot my proper companions! Not for them do I wait here in my mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my work I want to be, at my day: but they understand not what are the\\r\\nsigns of my morning, my step--is not for them the awakening-call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey still sleep in my cave; their dream still drinketh at my drunken\\r\\nsongs. The audient ear for ME--the OBEDIENT ear, is yet lacking in their\\r\\nlimbs.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun arose: then\\r\\nlooked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above him the sharp call of\\r\\nhis eagle. \"Well!\" called he upwards, \"thus is it pleasing and proper to\\r\\nme. Mine animals are awake, for I am awake.\\r\\n\\r\\nMine eagle is awake, and like me honoureth the sun. With eagle-talons\\r\\ndoth it grasp at the new light. Ye are my proper animals; I love you.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still do I lack my proper men!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra; then, however, it happened that all on a sudden\\r\\nhe became aware that he was flocked around and fluttered around, as if\\r\\nby innumerable birds,--the whizzing of so many wings, however, and the\\r\\ncrowding around his head was so great that he shut his eyes. And verily,\\r\\nthere came down upon him as it were a cloud, like a cloud of arrows\\r\\nwhich poureth upon a new enemy. But behold, here it was a cloud of love,\\r\\nand showered upon a new friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What happeneth unto me?\" thought Zarathustra in his astonished heart,\\r\\nand slowly seated himself on the big stone which lay close to the exit\\r\\nfrom his cave. But while he grasped about with his hands, around him,\\r\\nabove him and below him, and repelled the tender birds, behold, there\\r\\nthen happened to him something still stranger: for he grasped thereby\\r\\nunawares into a mass of thick, warm, shaggy hair; at the same time,\\r\\nhowever, there sounded before him a roar,--a long, soft lion-roar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"THE SIGN COMETH,\" said Zarathustra, and a change came over his heart.\\r\\nAnd in truth, when it turned clear before him, there lay a yellow,\\r\\npowerful animal at his feet, resting its head on his knee,--unwilling to\\r\\nleave him out of love, and doing like a dog which again findeth its old\\r\\nmaster. The doves, however, were no less eager with their love than the\\r\\nlion; and whenever a dove whisked over its nose, the lion shook its head\\r\\nand wondered and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all this went on Zarathustra spake only a word: \"MY CHILDREN ARE\\r\\nNIGH, MY CHILDREN\"--, then he became quite mute. His heart, however,\\r\\nwas loosed, and from his eyes there dropped down tears and fell upon\\r\\nhis hands. And he took no further notice of anything, but sat there\\r\\nmotionless, without repelling the animals further. Then flew the doves\\r\\nto and fro, and perched on his shoulder, and caressed his white hair,\\r\\nand did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness. The strong lion,\\r\\nhowever, licked always the tears that fell on Zarathustra\\'s hands, and\\r\\nroared and growled shyly. Thus did these animals do.--\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this went on for a long time, or a short time: for properly\\r\\nspeaking, there is NO time on earth for such things--. Meanwhile,\\r\\nhowever, the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra\\'s cave, and\\r\\nmarshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet Zarathustra, and\\r\\ngive him their morning greeting: for they had found when they awakened\\r\\nthat he no longer tarried with them. When, however, they reached the\\r\\ndoor of the cave and the noise of their steps had preceded them, the\\r\\nlion started violently; it turned away all at once from Zarathustra, and\\r\\nroaring wildly, sprang towards the cave. The higher men, however, when\\r\\nthey heard the lion roaring, cried all aloud as with one voice, fled\\r\\nback and vanished in an instant.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra himself, however, stunned and strange, rose from his seat,\\r\\nlooked around him, stood there astonished, inquired of his heart,\\r\\nbethought himself, and remained alone. \"What did I hear?\" said he at\\r\\nlast, slowly, \"what happened unto me just now?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut soon there came to him his recollection, and he took in at a glance\\r\\nall that had taken place between yesterday and to-day. \"Here is indeed\\r\\nthe stone,\" said he, and stroked his beard, \"on IT sat I yester-morn;\\r\\nand here came the soothsayer unto me, and here heard I first the cry\\r\\nwhich I heard just now, the great cry of distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nO ye higher men, YOUR distress was it that the old soothsayer foretold\\r\\nto me yester-morn,--\\r\\n\\r\\n--Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: \\'O\\r\\nZarathustra,\\' said he to me, \\'I come to seduce thee to thy last sin.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my last sin?\" cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at his own\\r\\nwords: \"WHAT hath been reserved for me as my last sin?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n--And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, and sat down\\r\\nagain on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly he sprang up,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"FELLOW-SUFFERING! FELLOW-SUFFERING WITH THE HIGHER MEN!\" he cried out,\\r\\nand his countenance changed into brass. \"Well! THAT--hath had its time!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy suffering and my fellow-suffering--what matter about them! Do I then\\r\\nstrive after HAPPINESS? I strive after my WORK!\\r\\n\\r\\nWell! The lion hath come, my children are nigh, Zarathustra hath grown\\r\\nripe, mine hour hath come:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is MY morning, MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE, THOU GREAT\\r\\nNOONTIDE!\"--\\r\\n\\r\\nThus spake Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and strong, like a\\r\\nmorning sun coming out of gloomy mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPENDIX.\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES ON \"THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA\" BY ANTHONY M. LUDOVICI.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had some opportunities of studying the conditions under which\\r\\nNietzsche is read in Germany, France, and England, and I have found\\r\\nthat, in each of these countries, students of his philosophy, as if\\r\\nactuated by precisely similar motives and desires, and misled by the\\r\\nsame mistaken tactics on the part of most publishers, all proceed in the\\r\\nsame happy-go-lucky style when \"taking him up.\" They have had it said to\\r\\nthem that he wrote without any system, and they very naturally conclude\\r\\nthat it does not matter in the least whether they begin with his first,\\r\\nthird, or last book, provided they can obtain a few vague ideas as to\\r\\nwhat his leading and most sensational principles were.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is clear that the book with the most mysterious, startling, or\\r\\nsuggestive title, will always stand the best chance of being purchased\\r\\nby those who have no other criteria to guide them in their choice\\r\\nthan the aspect of a title-page; and this explains why \"Thus Spake\\r\\nZarathustra\" is almost always the first and often the only one of\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s books that falls into the hands of the uninitiated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title suggests all kinds of mysteries; a glance at the\\r\\nchapter-headings quickly confirms the suspicions already aroused,\\r\\nand the sub-title: \"A Book for All and None\", generally succeeds in\\r\\ndissipating the last doubts the prospective purchaser may entertain\\r\\nconcerning his fitness for the book or its fitness for him. And what\\r\\nhappens?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" is taken home; the reader, who perchance may\\r\\nknow no more concerning Nietzsche than a magazine article has told him,\\r\\ntries to read it and, understanding less than half he reads, probably\\r\\nnever gets further than the second or third part,--and then only to feel\\r\\nconvinced that Nietzsche himself was \"rather hazy\" as to what he was\\r\\ntalking about. Such chapters as \"The Child with the Mirror\", \"In the\\r\\nHappy Isles\", \"The Grave-Song,\" \"Immaculate Perception,\" \"The Stillest\\r\\nHour\", \"The Seven Seals\", and many others, are almost utterly devoid of\\r\\nmeaning to all those who do not know something of Nietzsche\\'s life, his\\r\\naims and his friendships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\", though it is\\r\\nunquestionably Nietzsche\\'s opus magnum, is by no means the first of\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s works that the beginner ought to undertake to read. The\\r\\nauthor himself refers to it as the deepest work ever offered to the\\r\\nGerman public, and elsewhere speaks of his other writings as being\\r\\nnecessary for the understanding of it. But when it is remembered that\\r\\nin Zarathustra we not only have the history of his most intimate\\r\\nexperiences, friendships, feuds, disappointments, triumphs and the like,\\r\\nbut that the very form in which they are narrated is one which tends\\r\\nrather to obscure than to throw light upon them, the difficulties which\\r\\nmeet the reader who starts quite unprepared will be seen to be really\\r\\nformidable.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra, then,--this shadowy, allegorical personality, speaking in\\r\\nallegories and parables, and at times not even refraining from relating\\r\\nhis own dreams--is a figure we can understand but very imperfectly if we\\r\\nhave no knowledge of his creator and counterpart, Friedrich Nietzsche;\\r\\nand it were therefore well, previous to our study of the more abstruse\\r\\nparts of this book, if we were to turn to some authoritative book on\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s life and works and to read all that is there said on the\\r\\nsubject. Those who can read German will find an excellent guide, in this\\r\\nrespect, in Frau Foerster-Nietzsche\\'s exhaustive and highly interesting\\r\\nbiography of her brother: \"Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsche\\'s\" (published\\r\\nby Naumann); while the works of Deussen, Raoul Richter, and Baroness\\r\\nIsabelle von Unger-Sternberg, will be found to throw useful and\\r\\nnecessary light upon many questions which it would be difficult for a\\r\\nsister to touch upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to the actual philosophical views expounded in this work,\\r\\nthere is an excellent way of clearing up any difficulties they may\\r\\npresent, and that is by an appeal to Nietzsche\\'s other works. Again and\\r\\nagain, of course, he will be found to express himself so clearly that\\r\\nall reference to his other writings may be dispensed with; but where\\r\\nthis is not the case, the advice he himself gives is after all the best\\r\\nto be followed here, viz.:--to regard such works as: \"Joyful Science\",\\r\\n\"Beyond Good and Evil\", \"The Genealogy of Morals\", \"The Twilight of\\r\\nthe Idols\", \"The Antichrist\", \"The Will to Power\", etc., etc., as the\\r\\nnecessary preparation for \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThese directions, though they are by no means simple to carry out, seem\\r\\nat least to possess the quality of definiteness and straightforwardness.\\r\\n\"Follow them and all will be clear,\" I seem to imply. But I regret to\\r\\nsay that this is not really the case. For my experience tells me that\\r\\neven after the above directions have been followed with the greatest\\r\\npossible zeal, the student will still halt in perplexity before certain\\r\\npassages in the book before us, and wonder what they mean. Now, it is\\r\\nwith the view of giving a little additional help to all those who find\\r\\nthemselves in this position that I proceed to put forth my own personal\\r\\ninterpretation of the more abstruse passages in this work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn offering this little commentary to the Nietzsche student, I should\\r\\nlike it to be understood that I make no claim as to its infallibility or\\r\\nindispensability. It represents but an attempt on my part--a very feeble\\r\\none perhaps--to give the reader what little help I can in surmounting\\r\\ndifficulties which a long study of Nietzsche\\'s life and works has\\r\\nenabled me, partially I hope, to overcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it would be as well to start out with a broad and rapid sketch\\r\\nof Nietzsche as a writer on Morals, Evolution, and Sociology, so that\\r\\nthe reader may be prepared to pick out for himself, so to speak, all\\r\\npassages in this work bearing in any way upon Nietzsche\\'s views in those\\r\\nthree important branches of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n(A.) Nietzsche and Morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn morality, Nietzsche starts out by adopting the position of the\\r\\nrelativist. He says there are no absolute values \"good\" and \"evil\";\\r\\nthese are mere means adopted by all in order to acquire power to\\r\\nmaintain their place in the world, or to become supreme. It is the\\r\\nlion\\'s good to devour an antelope. It is the dead-leaf butterfly\\'s\\r\\ngood to tell a foe a falsehood. For when the dead-leaf butterfly is in\\r\\ndanger, it clings to the side of a twig, and what it says to its foe is\\r\\npractically this: \"I am not a butterfly, I am a dead leaf, and can be\\r\\nof no use to thee.\" This is a lie which is good to the butterfly, for\\r\\nit preserves it. In nature every species of organic being instinctively\\r\\nadopts and practises those acts which most conduce to the prevalence\\r\\nor supremacy of its kind. Once the most favourable order of conduct is\\r\\nfound, proved efficient and established, it becomes the ruling morality\\r\\nof the species that adopts it and bears them along to victory. All\\r\\nspecies must not and cannot value alike, for what is the lion\\'s good is\\r\\nthe antelope\\'s evil and vice versa.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcepts of good and evil are therefore, in their origin, merely a means\\r\\nto an end, they are expedients for acquiring power.\\r\\n\\r\\nApplying this principle to mankind, Nietzsche attacked Christian\\r\\nmoral values. He declared them to be, like all other morals, merely\\r\\nan expedient for protecting a certain type of man. In the case of\\r\\nChristianity this type was, according to Nietzsche, a low one.\\r\\n\\r\\nConflicting moral codes have been no more than the conflicting weapons\\r\\nof different classes of men; for in mankind there is a continual war\\r\\nbetween the powerful, the noble, the strong, and the well-constituted\\r\\non the one side, and the impotent, the mean, the weak, and the\\r\\nill-constituted on the other. The war is a war of moral principles.\\r\\nThe morality of the powerful class, Nietzsche calls NOBLE- or\\r\\nMASTER-MORALITY; that of the weak and subordinate class he calls\\r\\nSLAVE-MORALITY. In the first morality it is the eagle which, looking\\r\\ndown upon a browsing lamb, contends that \"eating lamb is good.\" In the\\r\\nsecond, the slave-morality, it is the lamb which, looking up from the\\r\\nsward, bleats dissentingly: \"Eating lamb is evil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(B.) The Master- and Slave-Morality Compared.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first morality is active, creative, Dionysian. The second is\\r\\npassive, defensive,--to it belongs the \"struggle for existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere attempts have not been made to reconcile the two moralities, they\\r\\nmay be described as follows:--All is GOOD in the noble morality which\\r\\nproceeds from strength, power, health, well-constitutedness, happiness,\\r\\nand awfulness; for, the motive force behind the people practising it is\\r\\n\"the struggle for power.\" The antithesis \"good and bad\" to this\\r\\nfirst class means the same as \"noble\" and \"despicable.\" \"Bad\" in the\\r\\nmaster-morality must be applied to the coward, to all acts that spring\\r\\nfrom weakness, to the man with \"an eye to the main chance,\" who would\\r\\nforsake everything in order to live.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the second, the slave-morality, the case is different. There,\\r\\ninasmuch as the community is an oppressed, suffering, unemancipated, and\\r\\nweary one, all THAT will be held to be good which alleviates the\\r\\nstate of suffering. Pity, the obliging hand, the warm heart, patience,\\r\\nindustry, and humility--these are unquestionably the qualities we shall\\r\\nhere find flooded with the light of approval and admiration; because\\r\\nthey are the most USEFUL qualities--; they make life endurable, they are\\r\\nof assistance in the \"struggle for existence\" which is the motive force\\r\\nbehind the people practising this morality. To this class, all that is\\r\\nAWFUL is bad, in fact it is THE evil par excellence. Strength, health,\\r\\nsuperabundance of animal spirits and power, are regarded with hate,\\r\\nsuspicion, and fear by the subordinate class.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Nietzsche believed that the first or the noble-morality conduced to\\r\\nan ascent in the line of life; because it was creative and active. On\\r\\nthe other hand, he believed that the second or slave-morality, where\\r\\nit became paramount, led to degeneration, because it was passive and\\r\\ndefensive, wanting merely to keep those who practised it alive. Hence\\r\\nhis earnest advocacy of noble-morality.\\r\\n\\r\\n(C.) Nietzsche and Evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche as an evolutionist I shall have occasion to define and discuss\\r\\nin the course of these notes (see Notes on Chapter LVI., par.10, and on\\r\\nChapter LVII.). For the present let it suffice for us to know that he\\r\\naccepted the \"Development Hypothesis\" as an explanation of the origin of\\r\\nspecies: but he did not halt where most naturalists have halted. He\\r\\nby no means regarded man as the highest possible being which evolution\\r\\ncould arrive at; for though his physical development may have reached\\r\\nits limit, this is not the case with his mental or spiritual attributes.\\r\\nIf the process be a fact; if things have BECOME what they are, then, he\\r\\ncontends, we may describe no limit to man\\'s aspirations. If he struggled\\r\\nup from barbarism, and still more remotely from the lower Primates,\\r\\nhis ideal should be to surpass man himself and reach Superman (see\\r\\nespecially the Prologue).\\r\\n\\r\\n(D.) Nietzsche and Sociology.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche as a sociologist aims at an aristocratic arrangement of\\r\\nsociety. He would have us rear an ideal race. Honest and truthful in\\r\\nintellectual matters, he could not even think that men are equal. \"With\\r\\nthese preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded. For\\r\\nthus speaketh justice unto ME: \\'Men are not equal.\\'\" He sees precisely\\r\\nin this inequality a purpose to be served, a condition to be exploited.\\r\\n\"Every elevation of the type \\'man,\\'\" he writes in \"Beyond Good and\\r\\nEvil\", \"has hitherto been the work of an aristocratic society--and so\\r\\nwill it always be--a society believing in a long scale of gradations of\\r\\nrank and differences of worth among human beings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who are sufficiently interested to desire to read his own detailed\\r\\naccount of the society he would fain establish, will find an excellent\\r\\npassage in Aphorism 57 of \"The Antichrist\".\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nPART I. THE PROLOGUE.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Part I. including the Prologue, no very great difficulties will\\r\\nappear. Zarathustra\\'s habit of designating a whole class of men or a\\r\\nwhole school of thought by a single fitting nickname may perhaps lead to\\r\\na little confusion at first; but, as a rule, when the general drift\\r\\nof his arguments is grasped, it requires but a slight effort of the\\r\\nimagination to discover whom he is referring to. In the ninth paragraph\\r\\nof the Prologue, for instance, it is quite obvious that \"Herdsmen\" in\\r\\nthe verse \"Herdsmen, I say, etc., etc.,\" stands for all those to-day\\r\\nwho are the advocates of gregariousness--of the ant-hill. And when our\\r\\nauthor says: \"A robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen,\" it\\r\\nis clear that these words may be taken almost literally from one whose\\r\\nideal was the rearing of a higher aristocracy. Again, \"the good and\\r\\njust,\" throughout the book, is the expression used in referring to the\\r\\nself-righteous of modern times,--those who are quite sure that they\\r\\nknow all that is to be known concerning good and evil, and are satisfied\\r\\nthat the values their little world of tradition has handed down to them,\\r\\nare destined to rule mankind as long as it lasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last paragraph of the Prologue, verse 7, Zarathustra gives us a\\r\\nforetaste of his teaching concerning the big and the little sagacities,\\r\\nexpounded subsequently. He says he would he were as wise as his serpent;\\r\\nthis desire will be found explained in the discourse entitled \"The\\r\\nDespisers of the Body\", which I shall have occasion to refer to later.\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DISCOURSES.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter I. The Three Metamorphoses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis opening discourse is a parable in which Zarathustra discloses the\\r\\nmental development of all creators of new values. It is the story of\\r\\na life which reaches its consummation in attaining to a second\\r\\ningenuousness or in returning to childhood. Nietzsche, the supposed\\r\\nanarchist, here plainly disclaims all relationship whatever to anarchy,\\r\\nfor he shows us that only by bearing the burdens of the existing law and\\r\\nsubmitting to it patiently, as the camel submits to being laden, does\\r\\nthe free spirit acquire that ascendancy over tradition which enables him\\r\\nto meet and master the dragon \"Thou shalt,\"--the dragon with the values\\r\\nof a thousand years glittering on its scales. There are two lessons in\\r\\nthis discourse: first, that in order to create one must be as a little\\r\\nchild; secondly, that it is only through existing law and order that\\r\\none attains to that height from which new law and new order may be\\r\\npromulgated.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter II. The Academic Chairs of Virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost the whole of this is quite comprehensible. It is a discourse\\r\\nagainst all those who confound virtue with tameness and smug ease, and\\r\\nwho regard as virtuous only that which promotes security and tends to\\r\\ndeepen sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IV. The Despisers of the Body.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Zarathustra gives names to the intellect and the instincts; he\\r\\ncalls the one \"the little sagacity\" and the latter \"the big sagacity.\"\\r\\nSchopenhauer\\'s teaching concerning the intellect is fully endorsed here.\\r\\n\"An instrument of thy body is also thy little sagacity, my brother,\\r\\nwhich thou callest \\'spirit,\\'\" says Zarathustra. From beginning to end it\\r\\nis a warning to those who would think too lightly of the instincts\\r\\nand unduly exalt the intellect and its derivatives: Reason and\\r\\nUnderstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IX. The Preachers of Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an analysis of the psychology of all those who have the \"evil\\r\\neye\" and are pessimists by virtue of their constitutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XV. The Thousand and One Goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this discourse Zarathustra opens his exposition of the doctrine of\\r\\nrelativity in morality, and declares all morality to be a mere means\\r\\nto power. Needless to say that verses 9, 10, 11, and 12 refer to the\\r\\nGreeks, the Persians, the Jews, and the Germans respectively. In the\\r\\npenultimate verse he makes known his discovery concerning the root of\\r\\nmodern Nihilism and indifference,--i.e., that modern man has no goal, no\\r\\naim, no ideals (see Note A).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVIII. Old and Young Women.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s views on women have either to be loved at first sight\\r\\nor they become perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of those who\\r\\notherwise would be inclined to accept his philosophy. Women especially,\\r\\nof course, have been taught to dislike them, because it has been\\r\\nrumoured that his views are unfriendly to themselves. Now, to my mind,\\r\\nall this is pure misunderstanding and error.\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman philosophers, thanks to Schopenhauer, have earned rather a bad\\r\\nname for their views on women. It is almost impossible for one of them\\r\\nto write a line on the subject, however kindly he may do so, without\\r\\nbeing suspected of wishing to open a crusade against the fair sex.\\r\\nDespite the fact, therefore, that all Nietzsche\\'s views in this respect\\r\\nwere dictated to him by the profoundest love; despite Zarathustra\\'s\\r\\nreservation in this discourse, that \"with women nothing (that can be\\r\\nsaid) is impossible,\" and in the face of other overwhelming evidence\\r\\nto the contrary, Nietzsche is universally reported to have mis son\\r\\npied dans le plat, where the female sex is concerned. And what is the\\r\\nfundamental doctrine which has given rise to so much bitterness and\\r\\naversion?--Merely this: that the sexes are at bottom ANTAGONISTIC--that\\r\\nis to say, as different as blue is from yellow, and that the best\\r\\npossible means of rearing anything approaching a desirable race is to\\r\\npreserve and to foster this profound hostility. What Nietzsche strives\\r\\nto combat and to overthrow is the modern democratic tendency which is\\r\\nslowly labouring to level all things--even the sexes. His quarrel is not\\r\\nwith women--what indeed could be more undignified?--it is with those who\\r\\nwould destroy the natural relationship between the sexes, by modifying\\r\\neither the one or the other with a view to making them more alike. The\\r\\nhuman world is just as dependent upon women\\'s powers as upon men\\'s. It\\r\\nis women\\'s strongest and most valuable instincts which help to determine\\r\\nwho are to be the fathers of the next generation. By destroying these\\r\\nparticular instincts, that is to say by attempting to masculinise woman,\\r\\nand to feminise men, we jeopardise the future of our people. The general\\r\\ndemocratic movement of modern times, in its frantic struggle to mitigate\\r\\nall differences, is now invading even the world of sex. It is against\\r\\nthis movement that Nietzsche raises his voice; he would have woman\\r\\nbecome ever more woman and man become ever more man. Only thus, and\\r\\nhe is undoubtedly right, can their combined instincts lead to the\\r\\nexcellence of humanity. Regarded in this light, all his views on woman\\r\\nappear not only necessary but just (see Note on Chapter LVI., par. 21.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to observe that the last line of the discourse, which\\r\\nhas so frequently been used by women as a weapon against Nietzsche\\'s\\r\\nviews concerning them, was suggested to Nietzsche by a woman (see \"Das\\r\\nLeben F. Nietzsche\\'s\").\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXI. Voluntary Death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to this discourse, I should only like to point out that\\r\\nNietzsche had a particular aversion to the word \"suicide\"--self-murder.\\r\\nHe disliked the evil it suggested, and in rechristening the act\\r\\nVoluntary Death, i.e., the death that comes from no other hand than\\r\\none\\'s own, he was desirous of elevating it to the position it held in\\r\\nclassical antiquity (see Aphorism 36 in \"The Twilight of the Idols\").\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXII. The Bestowing Virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important aspect of Nietzsche\\'s philosophy is brought to light in\\r\\nthis discourse. His teaching, as is well known, places the Aristotelian\\r\\nman of spirit, above all others in the natural divisions of man. The\\r\\nman with overflowing strength, both of mind and body, who must discharge\\r\\nthis strength or perish, is the Nietzschean ideal. To such a man, giving\\r\\nfrom his overflow becomes a necessity; bestowing develops into a means\\r\\nof existence, and this is the only giving, the only charity, that\\r\\nNietzsche recognises. In paragraph 3 of the discourse, we read\\r\\nZarathustra\\'s healthy exhortation to his disciples to become independent\\r\\nthinkers and to find themselves before they learn any more from him (see\\r\\nNotes on Chapters LVI., par. 5, and LXXIII., pars. 10, 11).\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIII. The Child with the Mirror.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche tells us here, in a poetical form, how deeply grieved he was\\r\\nby the manifold misinterpretations and misunderstandings which were\\r\\nbecoming rife concerning his publications. He does not recognise\\r\\nhimself in the mirror of public opinion, and recoils terrified from the\\r\\ndistorted reflection of his features. In verse 20 he gives us a\\r\\nhint which it were well not to pass over too lightly; for, in the\\r\\nintroduction to \"The Genealogy of Morals\" (written in 1887) he finds it\\r\\nnecessary to refer to the matter again and with greater precision. The\\r\\npoint is this, that a creator of new values meets with his surest and\\r\\nstrongest obstacles in the very spirit of the language which is at his\\r\\ndisposal. Words, like all other manifestations of an evolving race, are\\r\\nstamped with the values that have long been paramount in that race.\\r\\nNow, the original thinker who finds himself compelled to use the current\\r\\nspeech of his country in order to impart new and hitherto untried views\\r\\nto his fellows, imposes a task upon the natural means of communication\\r\\nwhich it is totally unfitted to perform,--hence the obscurities and\\r\\nprolixities which are so frequently met with in the writings of original\\r\\nthinkers. In the \"Dawn of Day\", Nietzsche actually cautions young\\r\\nwriters against THE DANGER OF ALLOWING THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE MOULDED BY\\r\\nTHE WORDS AT THEIR DISPOSAL.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIV. In the Happy Isles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile writing this, Nietzsche is supposed to have been thinking of the\\r\\nisland of Ischia which was ultimately destroyed by an earthquake. His\\r\\nteaching here is quite clear. He was among the first thinkers of Europe\\r\\nto overcome the pessimism which godlessness generally brings in its\\r\\nwake. He points to creating as the surest salvation from the suffering\\r\\nwhich is a concomitant of all higher life. \"What would there be to\\r\\ncreate,\" he asks, \"if there were--Gods?\" His ideal, the Superman, lends\\r\\nhim the cheerfulness necessary to the overcoming of that despair usually\\r\\nattendant upon godlessness and upon the apparent aimlessness of a world\\r\\nwithout a god.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIX. The Tarantulas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tarantulas are the Socialists and Democrats. This discourse offers\\r\\nus an analysis of their mental attitude. Nietzsche refuses to be\\r\\nconfounded with those resentful and revengeful ones who condemn society\\r\\nFROM BELOW, and whose criticism is only suppressed envy. \"There are\\r\\nthose who preach my doctrine of life,\" he says of the Nietzschean\\r\\nSocialists, \"and are at the same time preachers of equality and\\r\\ntarantulas\" (see Notes on Chapter XL. and Chapter LI.).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXX. The Famous Wise Ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis refers to all those philosophers hitherto, who have run in the\\r\\nharness of established values and have not risked their reputation with\\r\\nthe people in pursuit of truth. The philosopher, however, as Nietzsche\\r\\nunderstood him, is a man who creates new values, and thus leads mankind\\r\\nin a new direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIII. The Grave-Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Zarathustra sings about the ideals and friendships of his youth.\\r\\nVerses 27 to 31 undoubtedly refer to Richard Wagner (see Note on Chapter\\r\\nLXV.).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIV. Self-Surpassing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this discourse we get the best exposition in the whole book of\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s doctrine of the Will to Power. I go into this question\\r\\nthoroughly in the Note on Chapter LVII.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche was not an iconoclast from choice. Those who hastily class him\\r\\nwith the anarchists (or the Progressivists of the last century) fail\\r\\nto understand the high esteem in which he always held both law and\\r\\ndiscipline. In verse 41 of this most decisive discourse he truly\\r\\nexplains his position when he says: \"...he who hath to be a creator in\\r\\ngood and evil--verily he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values\\r\\nin pieces.\" This teaching in regard to self-control is evidence enough\\r\\nof his reverence for law.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXV. The Sublime Ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese belong to a type which Nietzsche did not altogether dislike, but\\r\\nwhich he would fain have rendered more subtle and plastic. It is the\\r\\ntype that takes life and itself too seriously, that never surmounts the\\r\\ncamel-stage mentioned in the first discourse, and that is obdurately\\r\\nsublime and earnest. To be able to smile while speaking of lofty things\\r\\nand NOT TO BE OPPRESSED by them, is the secret of real greatness. He\\r\\nwhose hand trembles when it lays hold of a beautiful thing, has the\\r\\nquality of reverence, without the artist\\'s unembarrassed friendship\\r\\nwith the beautiful. Hence the mistakes which have arisen in regard to\\r\\nconfounding Nietzsche with his extreme opposites the anarchists and\\r\\nagitators. For what they dare to touch and break with the impudence\\r\\nand irreverence of the unappreciative, he seems likewise to touch and\\r\\nbreak,--but with other fingers--with the fingers of the loving and\\r\\nunembarrassed artist who is on good terms with the beautiful and who\\r\\nfeels able to create it and to enhance it with his touch. The question\\r\\nof taste plays an important part in Nietzsche\\'s philosophy, and verses\\r\\n9, 10 of this discourse exactly state Nietzsche\\'s ultimate views on the\\r\\nsubject. In the \"Spirit of Gravity\", he actually cries:--\"Neither a good\\r\\nnor a bad taste, but MY taste, of which I have no longer either shame or\\r\\nsecrecy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVI. The Land of Culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a poetical epitome of some of the scathing criticism of\\r\\nscholars which appears in the first of the \"Thoughts out of Season\"--the\\r\\npolemical pamphlet (written in 1873) against David Strauss and his\\r\\nschool. He reproaches his former colleagues with being sterile and\\r\\nshows them that their sterility is the result of their not believing\\r\\nin anything. \"He who had to create, had always his presaging dreams and\\r\\nastral premonitions--and believed in believing!\" (See Note on Chapter\\r\\nLXXVII.) In the last two verses he reveals the nature of his altruism.\\r\\nHow far it differs from that of Christianity we have already read in the\\r\\ndiscourse \"Neighbour-Love\", but here he tells us definitely the nature\\r\\nof his love to mankind; he explains why he was compelled to assail the\\r\\nChristian values of pity and excessive love of the neighbour, not only\\r\\nbecause they are slave-values and therefore tend to promote degeneration\\r\\n(see Note B.), but because he could only love his children\\'s land, the\\r\\nundiscovered land in a remote sea; because he would fain retrieve the\\r\\nerrors of his fathers in his children.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVII. Immaculate Perception.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn important feature of Nietzsche\\'s interpretation of Life is disclosed\\r\\nin this discourse. As Buckle suggests in his \"Influence of Women on the\\r\\nProgress of Knowledge\", the scientific spirit of the investigator is\\r\\nboth helped and supplemented by the latter\\'s emotions and personality,\\r\\nand the divorce of all emotionalism and individual temperament from\\r\\nscience is a fatal step towards sterility. Zarathustra abjures all those\\r\\nwho would fain turn an IMPERSONAL eye upon nature and contemplate her\\r\\nphenomena with that pure objectivity to which the scientific idealists\\r\\nof to-day would so much like to attain. He accuses such idealists of\\r\\nhypocrisy and guile; he says they lack innocence in their desires and\\r\\ntherefore slander all desiring.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXVIII. Scholars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a record of Nietzsche\\'s final breach with his former\\r\\ncolleagues--the scholars of Germany. Already after the publication of\\r\\nthe \"Birth of Tragedy\", numbers of German philologists and professional\\r\\nphilosophers had denounced him as one who had strayed too far from\\r\\ntheir flock, and his lectures at the University of Bale were deserted\\r\\nin consequence; but it was not until 1879, when he finally severed all\\r\\nconnection with University work, that he may be said to have attained to\\r\\nthe freedom and independence which stamp this discourse.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXXIX. Poets.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have sometimes said that Nietzsche had no sense of humour. I\\r\\nhave no intention of defending him here against such foolish critics; I\\r\\nshould only like to point out to the reader that we have him here at\\r\\nhis best, poking fun at himself, and at his fellow-poets (see Note on\\r\\nChapter LXIII., pars. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XL. Great Events.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we seem to have a puzzle. Zarathustra himself, while relating\\r\\nhis experience with the fire-dog to his disciples, fails to get them\\r\\ninterested in his narrative, and we also may be only too ready to turn\\r\\nover these pages under the impression that they are little more than\\r\\na mere phantasy or poetical flight. Zarathustra\\'s interview with the\\r\\nfire-dog is, however, of great importance. In it we find Nietzsche\\r\\nface to face with the creature he most sincerely loathes--the spirit\\r\\nof revolution, and we obtain fresh hints concerning his hatred of the\\r\\nanarchist and rebel. \"\\'Freedom\\' ye all roar most eagerly,\" he says to\\r\\nthe fire-dog, \"but I have unlearned the belief in \\'Great Events\\' when\\r\\nthere is much roaring and smoke about them. Not around the inventors\\r\\nof new noise, but around the inventors of new values, doth the world\\r\\nrevolve; INAUDIBLY it revolveth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLI. The Soothsayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis refers, of course, to Schopenhauer. Nietzsche, as is well known,\\r\\nwas at one time an ardent follower of Schopenhauer. He overcame\\r\\nPessimism by discovering an object in existence; he saw the possibility\\r\\nof raising society to a higher level and preached the profoundest\\r\\nOptimism in consequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLII. Redemption.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra here addresses cripples. He tells them of other\\r\\ncripples--the GREAT MEN in this world who have one organ or faculty\\r\\ninordinately developed at the cost of their other faculties. This is\\r\\ndoubtless a reference to a fact which is too often noticeable in the\\r\\ncase of so many of the world\\'s giants in art, science, or religion. In\\r\\nverse 19 we are told what Nietzsche called Redemption--that is to say,\\r\\nthe ability to say of all that is past: \"Thus would I have it.\" The\\r\\nin ability to say this, and the resentment which results therefrom,\\r\\nhe regards as the source of all our feelings of revenge, and all our\\r\\ndesires to punish--punishment meaning to him merely a euphemism for the\\r\\nword revenge, invented in order to still our consciences. He who can be\\r\\nproud of his enemies, who can be grateful to them for the obstacles they\\r\\nhave put in his way; he who can regard his worst calamity as but the\\r\\nextra strain on the bow of his life, which is to send the arrow of\\r\\nhis longing even further than he could have hoped;--this man knows no\\r\\nrevenge, neither does he know despair, he truly has found redemption and\\r\\ncan turn on the worst in his life and even in himself, and call it his\\r\\nbest (see Notes on Chapter LVII.).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIII. Manly Prudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis discourse is very important. In \"Beyond Good and Evil\" we hear\\r\\noften enough that the select and superior man must wear a mask, and\\r\\nhere we find this injunction explained. \"And he who would not languish\\r\\namongst men, must learn to drink out of all glasses: and he who would\\r\\nkeep clean amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty\\r\\nwater.\" This, I venture to suggest, requires some explanation. At a time\\r\\nwhen individuality is supposed to be shown most tellingly by putting\\r\\nboots on one\\'s hands and gloves on one\\'s feet, it is somewhat refreshing\\r\\nto come across a true individualist who feels the chasm between himself\\r\\nand others so deeply, that he must perforce adapt himself to them\\r\\noutwardly, at least, in all respects, so that the inner difference\\r\\nshould be overlooked. Nietzsche practically tells us here that it is not\\r\\nhe who intentionally wears eccentric clothes or does eccentric things\\r\\nwho is truly the individualist. The profound man, who is by nature\\r\\ndifferentiated from his fellows, feels this difference too keenly to\\r\\ncall attention to it by any outward show. He is shamefast and bashful\\r\\nwith those who surround him and wishes not to be discovered by them,\\r\\njust as one instinctively avoids all lavish display of comfort or wealth\\r\\nin the presence of a poor friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIV. The Stillest Hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems to me to give an account of the great struggle which must\\r\\nhave taken place in Nietzsche\\'s soul before he finally resolved to make\\r\\nknown the more esoteric portions of his teaching. Our deepest feelings\\r\\ncrave silence. There is a certain self-respect in the serious man which\\r\\nmakes him hold his profoundest feelings sacred. Before they are uttered\\r\\nthey are full of the modesty of a virgin, and often the oldest sage will\\r\\nblush like a girl when this virginity is violated by an indiscretion\\r\\nwhich forces him to reveal his deepest thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is perhaps the most important of all the four parts. If it\\r\\ncontained only \"The Vision and the Enigma\" and \"The Old and New Tables\"\\r\\nI should still be of this opinion; for in the former of these discourses\\r\\nwe meet with what Nietzsche regarded as the crowning doctrine of his\\r\\nphilosophy and in \"The Old and New Tables\" we have a valuable epitome of\\r\\npractically all his leading principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVI. The Vision and the Enigma.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Vision and the Enigma\" is perhaps an example of Nietzsche in his\\r\\nmost obscure vein. We must know how persistently he inveighed against\\r\\nthe oppressing and depressing influence of man\\'s sense of guilt and\\r\\nconsciousness of sin in order fully to grasp the significance of this\\r\\ndiscourse. Slowly but surely, he thought the values of Christianity and\\r\\nJudaic traditions had done their work in the minds of men. What were\\r\\nonce but expedients devised for the discipline of a certain portion of\\r\\nhumanity, had now passed into man\\'s blood and had become instincts. This\\r\\noppressive and paralysing sense of guilt and of sin is what Nietzsche\\r\\nrefers to when he speaks of \"the spirit of gravity.\" This creature\\r\\nhalf-dwarf, half-mole, whom he bears with him a certain distance on his\\r\\nclimb and finally defies, and whom he calls his devil and arch-enemy, is\\r\\nnothing more than the heavy millstone \"guilty conscience,\" together with\\r\\nthe concept of sin which at present hangs round the neck of men. To rise\\r\\nabove it--to soar--is the most difficult of all things to-day. Nietzsche\\r\\nis able to think cheerfully and optimistically of the possibility of\\r\\nlife in this world recurring again and again, when he has once cast the\\r\\ndwarf from his shoulders, and he announces his doctrine of the Eternal\\r\\nRecurrence of all things great and small to his arch-enemy and in\\r\\ndefiance of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there is much to be said for Nietzsche\\'s hypothesis of the Eternal\\r\\nRecurrence of all things great and small, nobody who has read the\\r\\nliterature on the subject will doubt for an instant; but it remains a\\r\\nvery daring conjecture notwithstanding and even in its ultimate effect,\\r\\nas a dogma, on the minds of men, I venture to doubt whether Nietzsche\\r\\never properly estimated its worth (see Note on Chapter LVII.).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat follows is clear enough. Zarathustra sees a young shepherd\\r\\nstruggling on the ground with a snake holding fast to the back of his\\r\\nthroat. The sage, assuming that the snake must have crawled into the\\r\\nyoung man\\'s mouth while he lay sleeping, runs to his help and pulls\\r\\nat the loathsome reptile with all his might, but in vain. At last, in\\r\\ndespair, Zarathustra appeals to the young man\\'s will. Knowing full well\\r\\nwhat a ghastly operation he is recommending, he nevertheless cries,\\r\\n\"Bite! Bite! Its head off! Bite!\" as the only possible solution of the\\r\\ndifficulty. The young shepherd bites, and far away he spits the\\r\\nsnake\\'s head, whereupon he rises, \"No longer shepherd, no longer man--a\\r\\ntransfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that LAUGHED! Never on\\r\\nearth laughed a man as he laughed!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this parable the young shepherd is obviously the man of to-day; the\\r\\nsnake that chokes him represents the stultifying and paralysing social\\r\\nvalues that threaten to shatter humanity, and the advice \"Bite! Bite!\"\\r\\nis but Nietzsche\\'s exasperated cry to mankind to alter their values\\r\\nbefore it is too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVII. Involuntary Bliss.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, like \"The Wanderer\", is one of the many introspective passages\\r\\nin the work, and is full of innuendos and hints as to the Nietzschean\\r\\noutlook on life.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLVIII. Before Sunrise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we have a record of Zarathustra\\'s avowal of optimism, as also the\\r\\nimportant statement concerning \"Chance\" or \"Accident\" (verse 27). Those\\r\\nwho are familiar with Nietzsche\\'s philosophy will not require to be told\\r\\nwhat an important role his doctrine of chance plays in his teaching.\\r\\nThe Giant Chance has hitherto played with the puppet \"man,\"--this is\\r\\nthe fact he cannot contemplate with equanimity. Man shall now exploit\\r\\nchance, he says again and again, and make it fall on its knees before\\r\\nhim! (See verse 33 in \"On the Olive Mount\", and verses 9-10 in \"The\\r\\nBedwarfing Virtue\").\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XLIX. The Bedwarfing Virtue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis requires scarcely any comment. It is a satire on modern man and\\r\\nhis belittling virtues. In verses 23 and 24 of the second part of the\\r\\ndiscourse we are reminded of Nietzsche\\'s powerful indictment of the\\r\\ngreat of to-day, in the Antichrist (Aphorism 43):--\"At present\\r\\nnobody has any longer the courage for separate rights, for rights of\\r\\ndomination, for a feeling of reverence for himself and his equals,--FOR\\r\\nPATHOS OF DISTANCE...Our politics are MORBID from this want of\\r\\ncourage!--The aristocracy of character has been undermined most craftily\\r\\nby the lie of the equality of souls; and if the belief in the \\'privilege\\r\\nof the many,\\' makes revolutions and WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE them, it is\\r\\nChristianity, let us not doubt it, it is CHRISTIAN valuations, which\\r\\ntranslate every revolution merely into blood and crime!\" (see also\\r\\n\"Beyond Good and Evil\", pages 120, 121). Nietzsche thought it was a\\r\\nbad sign of the times that even rulers have lost the courage of\\r\\ntheir positions, and that a man of Frederick the Great\\'s power and\\r\\ndistinguished gifts should have been able to say: \"Ich bin der erste\\r\\nDiener des Staates\" (I am the first servant of the State.) To this\\r\\nutterance of the great sovereign, verse 24 undoubtedly refers.\\r\\n\"Cowardice\" and \"Mediocrity,\" are the names with which he labels modern\\r\\nnotions of virtue and moderation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Part III., we get the sentiments of the discourse \"In the Happy\\r\\nIsles\", but perhaps in stronger terms. Once again we find Nietzsche\\r\\nthoroughly at ease, if not cheerful, as an atheist, and speaking with\\r\\nvertiginous daring of making chance go on its knees to him. In verse\\r\\n20, Zarathustra makes yet another attempt at defining his entirely\\r\\nanti-anarchical attitude, and unless such passages have been completely\\r\\noverlooked or deliberately ignored hitherto by those who will persist in\\r\\nlaying anarchy at his door, it is impossible to understand how he ever\\r\\nbecame associated with that foul political party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last verse introduces the expression, \"THE GREAT NOONTIDE!\" In the\\r\\npoem to be found at the end of \"Beyond Good and Evil\", we meet with\\r\\nthe expression again, and we shall find it occurring time and again in\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s works. It will be found fully elucidated in the fifth part\\r\\nof \"The Twilight of the Idols\"; but for those who cannot refer to\\r\\nthis book, it were well to point out that Nietzsche called the present\\r\\nperiod--our period--the noon of man\\'s history. Dawn is behind us. The\\r\\nchildhood of mankind is over. Now we KNOW; there is now no longer any\\r\\nexcuse for mistakes which will tend to botch and disfigure the type man.\\r\\n\"With respect to what is past,\" he says, \"I have, like all discerning\\r\\nones, great toleration, that is to say, GENEROUS self-control...But my\\r\\nfeeling changes suddenly, and breaks out as soon as I enter the modern\\r\\nperiod, OUR period. Our age KNOWS...\" (See Note on Chapter LXX.).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LI. On Passing-by.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we find Nietzsche confronted with his extreme opposite, with\\r\\nhim therefore for whom he is most frequently mistaken by the unwary.\\r\\n\"Zarathustra\\'s ape\" he is called in the discourse. He is one of those\\r\\nat whose hands Nietzsche had to suffer most during his life-time, and\\r\\nat whose hands his philosophy has suffered most since his death. In this\\r\\nrespect it may seem a little trivial to speak of extremes meeting; but\\r\\nit is wonderfully apt. Many have adopted Nietzsche\\'s mannerisms and\\r\\nword-coinages, who had nothing in common with him beyond the ideas and\\r\\n\"business\" they plagiarised; but the superficial observer and a large\\r\\nportion of the public, not knowing of these things,--not knowing perhaps\\r\\nthat there are iconoclasts who destroy out of love and are therefore\\r\\ncreators, and that there are others who destroy out of resentment and\\r\\nrevengefulness and who are therefore revolutionists and anarchists,--are\\r\\nprone to confound the two, to the detriment of the nobler type.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we now read what the fool says to Zarathustra, and note the tricks of\\r\\nspeech he has borrowed from him: if we carefully follow the attitude\\r\\nhe assumes, we shall understand why Zarathustra finally interrupts him.\\r\\n\"Stop this at once,\" Zarathustra cries, \"long have thy speech and\\r\\nthy species disgusted me...Out of love alone shall my contempt and my\\r\\nwarning bird take wing; BUT NOT OUT OF THE SWAMP!\" It were well if\\r\\nthis discourse were taken to heart by all those who are too ready to\\r\\nassociate Nietzsche with lesser and noiser men,--with mountebanks and\\r\\nmummers.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LII. The Apostates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear that this applies to all those breathless and hasty \"tasters\\r\\nof everything,\" who plunge too rashly into the sea of independent\\r\\nthought and \"heresy,\" and who, having miscalculated their strength, find\\r\\nit impossible to keep their head above water. \"A little older, a little\\r\\ncolder,\" says Nietzsche. They soon clamber back to the conventions of\\r\\nthe age they intended reforming. The French then say \"le diable se fait\\r\\nhermite,\" but these men, as a rule, have never been devils, neither\\r\\ndo they become angels; for, in order to be really good or evil, some\\r\\nstrength and deep breathing is required. Those who are more interested\\r\\nin supporting orthodoxy than in being over nice concerning the kind of\\r\\nsupport they give it, often refer to these people as evidence in favour\\r\\nof the true faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LIII. The Return Home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an example of a class of writing which may be passed over too\\r\\nlightly by those whom poetasters have made distrustful of poetry. From\\r\\nfirst to last it is extremely valuable as an autobiographical note. The\\r\\ninevitable superficiality of the rabble is contrasted with the peaceful\\r\\nand profound depths of the anchorite. Here we first get a direct hint\\r\\nconcerning Nietzsche\\'s fundamental passion--the main force behind all\\r\\nhis new values and scathing criticism of existing values. In verse 30\\r\\nwe are told that pity was his greatest danger. The broad altruism of the\\r\\nlaw-giver, thinking over vast eras of time, was continually being pitted\\r\\nby Nietzsche, in himself, against that transient and meaner sympathy for\\r\\nthe neighbour which he more perhaps than any of his contemporaries had\\r\\nsuffered from, but which he was certain involved enormous dangers not\\r\\nonly for himself but also to the next and subsequent generations (see\\r\\nNote B., where \"pity\" is mentioned among the degenerate virtues). Later\\r\\nin the book we shall see how his profound compassion leads him into\\r\\ntemptation, and how frantically he struggles against it. In verses 31\\r\\nand 32, he tells us to what extent he had to modify himself in order\\r\\nto be endured by his fellows whom he loved (see also verse 12 in \"Manly\\r\\nPrudence\"). Nietzsche\\'s great love for his fellows, which he confesses\\r\\nin the Prologue, and which is at the root of all his teaching, seems\\r\\nrather to elude the discerning powers of the average philanthropist and\\r\\nmodern man. He cannot see the wood for the trees. A philanthropy that\\r\\nsacrifices the minority of the present-day for the majority constituting\\r\\nposterity, completely evades his mental grasp, and Nietzsche\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy, because it declares Christian values to be a danger to the\\r\\nfuture of our kind, is therefore shelved as brutal, cold, and hard (see\\r\\nNote on Chapter XXXVI.). Nietzsche tried to be all things to all men;\\r\\nhe was sufficiently fond of his fellows for that: in the Return Home he\\r\\ndescribes how he ultimately returns to loneliness in order to recover\\r\\nfrom the effects of his experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LIV. The Three Evil Things.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche is here completely in his element. Three things hitherto\\r\\nbest-cursed and most calumniated on earth, are brought forward to be\\r\\nweighed. Voluptuousness, thirst of power, and selfishness,--the three\\r\\nforces in humanity which Christianity has done most to garble and\\r\\nbesmirch,--Nietzsche endeavours to reinstate in their former places of\\r\\nhonour. Voluptuousness, or sensual pleasure, is a dangerous thing to\\r\\ndiscuss nowadays. If we mention it with favour we may be regarded,\\r\\nhowever unjustly, as the advocate of savages, satyrs, and pure\\r\\nsensuality. If we condemn it, we either go over to the Puritans or we\\r\\njoin those who are wont to come to table with no edge to their appetites\\r\\nand who therefore grumble at all good fare. There can be no doubt that\\r\\nthe value of healthy innocent voluptuousness, like the value of health\\r\\nitself, must have been greatly discounted by all those who, resenting\\r\\ntheir inability to partake of this world\\'s goods, cried like St Paul:\\r\\n\"I would that all men were even as I myself.\" Now Nietzsche\\'s philosophy\\r\\nmight be called an attempt at giving back to healthy and normal men\\r\\ninnocence and a clean conscience in their desires--NOT to applaud the\\r\\nvulgar sensualists who respond to every stimulus and whose passions are\\r\\nout of hand; not to tell the mean, selfish individual, whose selfishness\\r\\nis a pollution (see Aphorism 33, \"Twilight of the Idols\"), that he is\\r\\nright, nor to assure the weak, the sick, and the crippled, that the\\r\\nthirst of power, which they gratify by exploiting the happier and\\r\\nhealthier individuals, is justified;--but to save the clean healthy man\\r\\nfrom the values of those around him, who look at everything through the\\r\\nmud that is in their own bodies,--to give him, and him alone, a clean\\r\\nconscience in his manhood and the desires of his manhood. \"Do I counsel\\r\\nyou to slay your instincts? I counsel to innocence in your instincts.\"\\r\\nIn verse 7 of the second paragraph (as in verse I of paragraph 19 in\\r\\n\"The Old and New Tables\") Nietzsche gives us a reason for his occasional\\r\\nobscurity (see also verses 3 to 7 of \"Poets\"). As I have already pointed\\r\\nout, his philosophy is quite esoteric. It can serve no purpose with the\\r\\nordinary, mediocre type of man. I, personally, can no longer have any\\r\\ndoubt that Nietzsche\\'s only object, in that part of his philosophy where\\r\\nhe bids his friends stand \"Beyond Good and Evil\" with him, was to save\\r\\nhigher men, whose growth and scope might be limited by the too\\r\\nstrict observance of modern values from foundering on the rocks of a\\r\\n\"Compromise\" between their own genius and traditional conventions. The\\r\\nonly possible way in which the great man can achieve greatness is\\r\\nby means of exceptional freedom--the freedom which assists him in\\r\\nexperiencing HIMSELF. Verses 20 to 30 afford an excellent supplement to\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s description of the attitude of the noble type towards the\\r\\nslaves in Aphorism 260 of the work \"Beyond Good and Evil\" (see also Note\\r\\nB.)\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LV. The Spirit of Gravity.\\r\\n\\r\\n(See Note on Chapter XLVI.) In Part II. of this discourse we meet with\\r\\na doctrine not touched upon hitherto, save indirectly;--I refer to the\\r\\ndoctrine of self-love. We should try to understand this perfectly before\\r\\nproceeding; for it is precisely views of this sort which, after having\\r\\nbeen cut out of the original context, are repeated far and wide as\\r\\ninternal evidence proving the general unsoundness of Nietzsche\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy. Already in the last of the \"Thoughts out of Season\"\\r\\nNietzsche speaks as follows about modern men: \"...these modern creatures\\r\\nwish rather to be hunted down, wounded and torn to shreds, than to\\r\\nlive alone with themselves in solitary calm. Alone with oneself!--this\\r\\nthought terrifies the modern soul; it is his one anxiety, his one\\r\\nghastly fear\" (English Edition, page 141). In his feverish scurry to\\r\\nfind entertainment and diversion, whether in a novel, a newspaper, or a\\r\\nplay, the modern man condemns his own age utterly; for he shows that in\\r\\nhis heart of hearts he despises himself. One cannot change a condition\\r\\nof this sort in a day; to become endurable to oneself an inner\\r\\ntransformation is necessary. Too long have we lost ourselves in our\\r\\nfriends and entertainments to be able to find ourselves so soon at\\r\\nanother\\'s bidding. \"And verily, it is no commandment for to-day and\\r\\nto-morrow to LEARN to love oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest,\\r\\nsubtlest, last, and patientest.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last verse Nietzsche challenges us to show that our way is\\r\\nthe right way. In his teaching he does not coerce us, nor does he\\r\\noverpersuade; he simply says: \"I am a law only for mine own, I am not a\\r\\nlaw for all. This--is now MY way,--where is yours?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LVI. Old and New Tables. Par. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche himself declares this to be the most decisive portion of\\r\\nthe whole of \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\". It is a sort of epitome of his\\r\\nleading doctrines. In verse 12 of the second paragraph, we learn how he\\r\\nhimself would fain have abandoned the poetical method of expression had\\r\\nhe not known only too well that the only chance a new doctrine has of\\r\\nsurviving, nowadays, depends upon its being given to the world in some\\r\\nkind of art-form. Just as prophets, centuries ago, often had to have\\r\\nrecourse to the mask of madness in order to mitigate the hatred of those\\r\\nwho did not and could not see as they did; so, to-day, the struggle for\\r\\nexistence among opinions and values is so great, that an art-form\\r\\nis practically the only garb in which a new philosophy can dare to\\r\\nintroduce itself to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 3 and 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the paragraphs will be found to be merely reminiscent of former\\r\\ndiscourses. For instance, par. 3 recalls \"Redemption\". The last verse\\r\\nof par. 4 is important. Freedom which, as I have pointed out before,\\r\\nNietzsche considered a dangerous acquisition in inexperienced or\\r\\nunworthy hands, here receives its death-blow as a general desideratum.\\r\\nIn the first Part we read under \"The Way of the Creating One\", that\\r\\nfreedom as an end in itself does not concern Zarathustra at all. He says\\r\\nthere: \"Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra? Clearly,\\r\\nhowever, shall thine eye answer me: free FOR WHAT?\" And in \"The\\r\\nBedwarfing Virtue\": \"Ah that ye understood my word: \\'Do ever what ye\\r\\nwill--but first be such as CAN WILL.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we have a description of the kind of altruism Nietzsche exacted\\r\\nfrom higher men. It is really a comment upon \"The Bestowing Virtue\" (see\\r\\nNote on Chapter XXII.).\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis refers, of course, to the reception pioneers of Nietzsche\\'s stamp\\r\\nmeet with at the hands of their contemporaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche teaches that nothing is stable,--not even values,--not\\r\\neven the concepts good and evil. He likens life unto a stream. But\\r\\nfoot-bridges and railings span the stream, and they seem to stand\\r\\nfirm. Many will be reminded of good and evil when they look upon these\\r\\nstructures; for thus these same values stand over the stream of life,\\r\\nand life flows on beneath them and leaves them standing. When, however,\\r\\nwinter comes and the stream gets frozen, many inquire: \"Should not\\r\\neverything--STAND STILL? Fundamentally everything standeth still.\" But\\r\\nsoon the spring cometh and with it the thaw-wind. It breaks the ice, and\\r\\nthe ice breaks down the foot-bridges and railings, whereupon everything\\r\\nis swept away. This state of affairs, according to Nietzsche, has now\\r\\nbeen reached. \"Oh, my brethren, is not everything AT PRESENT IN FLUX?\\r\\nHave not all railings and foot-bridges fallen into the water? Who would\\r\\nstill HOLD ON to \\'good\\' and \\'evil\\'?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is complementary to the first three verses of par. 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 10.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, this is perhaps the most important paragraph. It is a protest\\r\\nagainst reading a moral order of things in life. \"Life is something\\r\\nessentially immoral!\" Nietzsche tells us in the introduction to the\\r\\n\"Birth of Tragedy\". Even to call life \"activity,\" or to define it\\r\\nfurther as \"the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external\\r\\nrelations,\" as Spencer has it, Nietzsche characterises as a \"democratic\\r\\nidiosyncracy.\" He says to define it in this way, \"is to mistake the\\r\\ntrue nature and function of life, which is Will to Power...Life is\\r\\nESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak,\\r\\nsuppression, severity, obtrusion of its own forms, incorporation and\\r\\nat least, putting it mildest, exploitation.\" Adaptation is merely a\\r\\nsecondary activity, a mere re-activity (see Note on Chapter LVII.).\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 11, 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese deal with Nietzsche\\'s principle of the desirability of rearing a\\r\\nselect race. The biological and historical grounds for his insistence\\r\\nupon this principle are, of course, manifold. Gobineau in his great\\r\\nwork, \"L\\'Inegalite des Races Humaines\", lays strong emphasis upon the\\r\\nevils which arise from promiscuous and inter-social marriages. He alone\\r\\nwould suffice to carry Nietzsche\\'s point against all those who are\\r\\nopposed to the other conditions, to the conditions which would have\\r\\nsaved Rome, which have maintained the strength of the Jewish race, and\\r\\nwhich are strictly maintained by every breeder of animals throughout the\\r\\nworld. Darwin in his remarks relative to the degeneration of CULTIVATED\\r\\ntypes of animals through the action of promiscuous breeding, brings\\r\\nGobineau support from the realm of biology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last two verses of par. 12 were discussed in the Notes on Chapters\\r\\nXXXVI. and LIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, like the first part of \"The Soothsayer\", is obviously a reference\\r\\nto the Schopenhauerian Pessimism.\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 14, 15, 16, 17.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are supplementary to the discourse \"Backworld\\'s-men\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 18.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must be careful to separate this paragraph, in sense, from the\\r\\nprevious four paragraphs. Nietzsche is still dealing with Pessimism\\r\\nhere; but it is the pessimism of the hero--the man most susceptible of\\r\\nall to desperate views of life, owing to the obstacles that are arrayed\\r\\nagainst him in a world where men of his kind are very rare and are\\r\\ncontinually being sacrificed. It was to save this man that Nietzsche\\r\\nwrote. Heroism foiled, thwarted, and wrecked, hoping and fighting until\\r\\nthe last, is at length overtaken by despair, and renounces all struggle\\r\\nfor sleep. This is not the natural or constitutional pessimism which\\r\\nproceeds from an unhealthy body--the dyspeptic\\'s lack of appetite; it\\r\\nis rather the desperation of the netted lion that ultimately stops all\\r\\nmovement, because the more it moves the more involved it becomes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 20.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"All that increases power is good, all that springs from weakness is\\r\\nbad. The weak and ill-constituted shall perish: first principle of our\\r\\ncharity. And one shall also help them thereto.\" Nietzsche partly divined\\r\\nthe kind of reception moral values of this stamp would meet with at\\r\\nthe hands of the effeminate manhood of Europe. Here we see that he had\\r\\nanticipated the most likely form their criticism would take (see also\\r\\nthe last two verses of par. 17).\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ten verses, here, are reminiscent of \"War and Warriors\" and\\r\\nof \"The Flies in the Market-place.\" Verses 11 and 12, however, are\\r\\nparticularly important. There is a strong argument in favour of the\\r\\nsharp differentiation of castes and of races (and even of sexes; see\\r\\nNote on Chapter XVIII.) running all through Nietzsche\\'s writings.\\r\\nBut sharp differentiation also implies antagonism in some form or\\r\\nother--hence Nietzsche\\'s fears for modern men. What modern men desire\\r\\nabove all, is peace and the cessation of pain. But neither great races\\r\\nnor great castes have ever been built up in this way. \"Who still wanteth\\r\\nto rule?\" Zarathustra asks in the \"Prologue\". \"Who still wanteth to\\r\\nobey? Both are too burdensome.\" This is rapidly becoming everybody\\'s\\r\\nattitude to-day. The tame moral reading of the face of nature, together\\r\\nwith such democratic interpretations of life as those suggested by\\r\\nHerbert Spencer, are signs of a physiological condition which is the\\r\\nreverse of that bounding and irresponsible healthiness in which harder\\r\\nand more tragic values rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 24.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should be read in conjunction with \"Child and Marriage\". In the\\r\\nfifth verse we shall recognise our old friend \"Marriage on the ten-years\\r\\nsystem,\" which George Meredith suggested some years ago. This, however,\\r\\nmust not be taken too literally. I do not think Nietzsche\\'s profoundest\\r\\nviews on marriage were ever intended to be given over to the public at\\r\\nall, at least not for the present. They appear in the biography by his\\r\\nsister, and although their wisdom is unquestionable, the nature of the\\r\\nreforms he suggests render it impossible for them to become popular just\\r\\nnow.\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 26, 27.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee Note on \"The Prologue\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 28.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche was not an iconoclast from predilection. No bitterness or\\r\\nempty hate dictated his vituperations against existing values and\\r\\nagainst the dogmas of his parents and forefathers. He knew too well what\\r\\nthese things meant to the millions who profess them, to approach the\\r\\ntask of uprooting them with levity or even with haste. He saw what\\r\\nmodern anarchists and revolutionists do NOT see--namely, that man is in\\r\\ndanger of actual destruction when his customs and values are broken.\\r\\nI need hardly point out, therefore, how deeply he was conscious of\\r\\nthe responsibility he threw upon our shoulders when he invited us to\\r\\nreconsider our position. The lines in this paragraph are evidence enough\\r\\nof his earnestness.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LVII. The Convalescent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe meet with several puzzles here. Zarathustra calls himself the\\r\\nadvocate of the circle (the Eternal Recurrence of all things), and he\\r\\ncalls this doctrine his abysmal thought. In the last verse of the\\r\\nfirst paragraph, however, after hailing his deepest thought, he cries:\\r\\n\"Disgust, disgust, disgust!\" We know Nietzsche\\'s ideal man was that\\r\\n\"world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious creature, who has not only\\r\\nlearnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and is, but wishes\\r\\nto have it again, AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity insatiably calling\\r\\nout da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole piece and play\" (see\\r\\nNote on Chapter XLII.). But if one ask oneself what the conditions to\\r\\nsuch an attitude are, one will realise immediately how utterly different\\r\\nNietzsche was from his ideal. The man who insatiably cries da capo to\\r\\nhimself and to the whole of his mise-en-scene, must be in a position to\\r\\ndesire every incident in his life to be repeated, not once, but\\r\\nagain and again eternally. Now, Nietzsche\\'s life had been too full of\\r\\ndisappointments, illness, unsuccessful struggles, and snubs, to allow of\\r\\nhis thinking of the Eternal Recurrence without loathing--hence probably\\r\\nthe words of the last verse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn verses 15 and 16, we have Nietzsche declaring himself an evolutionist\\r\\nin the broadest sense--that is to say, that he believes in the\\r\\nDevelopment Hypothesis as the description of the process by which\\r\\nspecies have originated. Now, to understand his position correctly\\r\\nwe must show his relationship to the two greatest of modern\\r\\nevolutionists--Darwin and Spencer. As a philosopher, however, Nietzsche\\r\\ndoes not stand or fall by his objections to the Darwinian or Spencerian\\r\\ncosmogony. He never laid claim to a very profound knowledge of biology,\\r\\nand his criticism is far more valuable as the attitude of a fresh mind\\r\\nthan as that of a specialist towards the question. Moreover, in his\\r\\nobjections many difficulties are raised which are not settled by an\\r\\nappeal to either of the men above mentioned. We have given Nietzsche\\'s\\r\\ndefinition of life in the Note on Chapter LVI., par. 10. Still, there\\r\\nremains a hope that Darwin and Nietzsche may some day become reconciled\\r\\nby a new description of the processes by which varieties occur. The\\r\\nappearance of varieties among animals and of \"sporting plants\" in\\r\\nthe vegetable kingdom, is still shrouded in mystery, and the question\\r\\nwhether this is not precisely the ground on which Darwin and Nietzsche\\r\\nwill meet, is an interesting one. The former says in his \"Origin of\\r\\nSpecies\", concerning the causes of variability: \"...there are two\\r\\nfactors, namely, the nature of the organism, and the nature of the\\r\\nconditions. THE FORMER SEEMS TO BE MUCH THE MORE IMPORTANT (The italics\\r\\nare mine.), for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as\\r\\nfar as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and on the other hand,\\r\\ndissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be\\r\\nnearly uniform.\" Nietzsche, recognising this same truth, would ascribe\\r\\npractically all the importance to the \"highest functionaries in the\\r\\norganism, in which the life-will appears as an active and formative\\r\\nprinciple,\" and except in certain cases (where passive organisms alone\\r\\nare concerned) would not give such a prominent place to the influence\\r\\nof environment. Adaptation, according to him, is merely a secondary\\r\\nactivity, a mere re-activity, and he is therefore quite opposed to\\r\\nSpencer\\'s definition: \"Life is the continuous adjustment of internal\\r\\nrelations to external relations.\" Again in the motive force behind\\r\\nanimal and plant life, Nietzsche disagrees with Darwin. He\\r\\ntransforms the \"Struggle for Existence\"--the passive and involuntary\\r\\ncondition--into the \"Struggle for Power,\" which is active and creative,\\r\\nand much more in harmony with Darwin\\'s own view, given above, concerning\\r\\nthe importance of the organism itself. The change is one of such\\r\\nfar-reaching importance that we cannot dispose of it in a breath, as a\\r\\nmere play upon words. \"Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the\\r\\nliving one.\" Nietzsche says that to speak of the activity of life as a\\r\\n\"struggle for existence,\" is to state the case inadequately. He warns us\\r\\nnot to confound Malthus with nature. There is something more than\\r\\nthis struggle between the organic beings on this earth; want, which is\\r\\nsupposed to bring this struggle about, is not so common as is supposed;\\r\\nsome other force must be operative. The Will to Power is this force,\\r\\n\"the instinct of self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most\\r\\nfrequent results thereof.\" A certain lack of acumen in psychological\\r\\nquestions and the condition of affairs in England at the time Darwin\\r\\nwrote, may both, according to Nietzsche, have induced the renowned\\r\\nnaturalist to describe the forces of nature as he did in his \"Origin of\\r\\nSpecies\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn verses 28, 29, and 30 of the second portion of this discourse we meet\\r\\nwith a doctrine which, at first sight, seems to be merely \"le manoir\\r\\na l\\'envers,\" indeed one English critic has actually said of Nietzsche,\\r\\nthat \"Thus Spake Zarathustra\" is no more than a compendium of modern\\r\\nviews and maxims turned upside down. Examining these heterodox\\r\\npronouncements a little more closely, however, we may possibly perceive\\r\\ntheir truth. Regarding good and evil as purely relative values, it\\r\\nstands to reason that what may be bad or evil in a given man, relative\\r\\nto a certain environment, may actually be good if not highly virtuous\\r\\nin him relative to a certain other environment. If this hypothetical man\\r\\nrepresent the ascending line of life--that is to say, if he promise all\\r\\nthat which is highest in a Graeco-Roman sense, then it is likely that\\r\\nhe will be condemned as wicked if introduced into the society of men\\r\\nrepresenting the opposite and descending line of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy depriving a man of his wickedness--more particularly nowadays--\\r\\ntherefore, one may unwittingly be doing violence to the greatest in him.\\r\\nIt may be an outrage against his wholeness, just as the lopping-off of a\\r\\nleg would be. Fortunately, the natural so-called \"wickedness\" of higher\\r\\nmen has in a certain measure been able to resist this lopping process\\r\\nwhich successive slave-moralities have practised; but signs are not\\r\\nwanting which show that the noblest wickedness is fast vanishing from\\r\\nsociety--the wickedness of courage and determination--and that Nietzsche\\r\\nhad good reasons for crying: \"Ah, that (man\\'s) baddest is so very small!\\r\\nAh, that his best is so very small. What is good? To be brave is good!\\r\\nIt is the good war which halloweth every cause!\" (see also par. 5,\\r\\n\"Higher Man\").\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LX. The Seven Seals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a final paean which Zarathustra sings to Eternity and the\\r\\nmarriage-ring of rings, the ring of the Eternal Recurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nPART IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion this part is Nietzsche\\'s open avowal that all his\\r\\nphilosophy, together with all his hopes, enthusiastic outbursts,\\r\\nblasphemies, prolixities, and obscurities, were merely so many gifts\\r\\nlaid at the feet of higher men. He had no desire to save the world. What\\r\\nhe wished to determine was: Who is to be master of the world? This is\\r\\na very different thing. He came to save higher men;--to give them that\\r\\nfreedom by which, alone, they can develop and reach their zenith (see\\r\\nNote on Chapter LIV., end). It has been argued, and with considerable\\r\\nforce, that no such philosophy is required by higher men, that, as a\\r\\nmatter of fact, higher men, by virtue of their constitutions always, do\\r\\nstand Beyond Good and Evil, and never allow anything to stand in the\\r\\nway of their complete growth. Nietzsche, however, was evidently not so\\r\\nconfident about this. He would probably have argued that we only see the\\r\\nsuccessful cases. Being a great man himself, he was well aware of the\\r\\ndangers threatening greatness in our age. In \"Beyond Good and Evil\" he\\r\\nwrites: \"There are few pains so grievous as to have seen, divined,\\r\\nor experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and\\r\\ndeteriorated...\" He knew \"from his painfullest recollections on what\\r\\nwretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank have\\r\\nhitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become\\r\\ncontemptible.\" Now in Part IV. we shall find that his strongest\\r\\ntemptation to descend to the feeling of \"pity\" for his contemporaries,\\r\\nis the \"cry for help\" which he hears from the lips of the higher men\\r\\nexposed to the dreadful danger of their modern environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXI. The Honey Sacrifice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fourteenth verse of this discourse Nietzsche defines the solemn\\r\\nduty he imposed upon himself: \"Become what thou art.\" Surely the\\r\\ncriticism which has been directed against this maxim must all fall to\\r\\nthe ground when it is remembered, once and for all, that Nietzsche\\'s\\r\\nteaching was never intended to be other than an esoteric one. \"I am a\\r\\nlaw only for mine own,\" he says emphatically, \"I am not a law for\\r\\nall.\" It is of the greatest importance to humanity that its highest\\r\\nindividuals should be allowed to attain to their full development; for,\\r\\nonly by means of its heroes can the human race be led forward step by\\r\\nstep to higher and yet higher levels. \"Become what thou art\" applied\\r\\nto all, of course, becomes a vicious maxim; it is to be hoped, however,\\r\\nthat we may learn in time that the same action performed by a given\\r\\nnumber of men, loses its identity precisely that same number of\\r\\ntimes.--\"Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the last eight verses many readers may be tempted to laugh. In\\r\\nEngland we almost always laugh when a man takes himself seriously at\\r\\nanything save sport. And there is of course no reason why the reader\\r\\nshould not be hilarious.--A certain greatness is requisite, both in\\r\\norder to be sublime and to have reverence for the sublime. Nietzsche\\r\\nearnestly believed that the Zarathustra-kingdom--his dynasty of a\\r\\nthousand years--would one day come; if he had not believed it so\\r\\nearnestly, if every artist in fact had not believed so earnestly in\\r\\nhis Hazar, whether of ten, fifteen, a hundred, or a thousand years, we\\r\\nshould have lost all our higher men; they would have become pessimists,\\r\\nsuicides, or merchants. If the minor poet and philosopher has made us\\r\\nshy of the prophetic seriousness which characterized an Isaiah or a\\r\\nJeremiah, it is surely our loss and the minor poet\\'s gain.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXII. The Cry of Distress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now meet with Zarathustra in extraordinary circumstances. He is\\r\\nconfronted with Schopenhauer and tempted by the old Soothsayer to commit\\r\\nthe sin of pity. \"I have come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!\"\\r\\nsays the Soothsayer to Zarathustra. It will be remembered that in\\r\\nSchopenhauer\\'s ethics, pity is elevated to the highest place among the\\r\\nvirtues, and very consistently too, seeing that the Weltanschauung is\\r\\na pessimistic one. Schopenhauer appeals to Nietzsche\\'s deepest and\\r\\nstrongest sentiment--his sympathy for higher men. \"Why dost thou conceal\\r\\nthyself?\" he cries. \"It is THE HIGHER MAN that calleth for thee!\"\\r\\nZarathustra is almost overcome by the Soothsayer\\'s pleading, as he\\r\\nhad been once already in the past, but he resists him step by step. At\\r\\nlength he can withstand him no longer, and, on the plea that the higher\\r\\nman is on his ground and therefore under his protection, Zarathustra\\r\\ndeparts in search of him, leaving Schopenhauer--a higher man in\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s opinion--in the cave as a guest.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXIII. Talk with the Kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his way Zarathustra meets two more higher men of his time; two\\r\\nkings cross his path. They are above the average modern type; for their\\r\\ninstincts tell them what real ruling is, and they despise the mockery\\r\\nwhich they have been taught to call \"Reigning.\" \"We ARE NOT the first\\r\\nmen,\" they say, \"and have nevertheless to STAND FOR them: of this\\r\\nimposture have we at last become weary and disgusted.\" It is the kings\\r\\nwho tell Zarathustra: \"There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny\\r\\nthan when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. There\\r\\neverything becometh false and distorted and monstrous.\" The kings are\\r\\nalso asked by Zarathustra to accept the shelter of his cave, whereupon\\r\\nhe proceeds on his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXIV. The Leech.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the higher men whom Zarathustra wishes to save, is also the\\r\\nscientific specialist--the man who honestly and scrupulously pursues his\\r\\ninvestigations, as Darwin did, in one department of knowledge. \"I love\\r\\nhim who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that the\\r\\nSuperman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he his own down-going.\"\\r\\n\"The spiritually conscientious one,\" he is called in this discourse.\\r\\nZarathustra steps on him unawares, and the slave of science, bleeding\\r\\nfrom the violence he has done to himself by his self-imposed task,\\r\\nspeaks proudly of his little sphere of knowledge--his little hand\\'s\\r\\nbreadth of ground on Zarathustra\\'s territory, philosophy. \"Where mine\\r\\nhonesty ceaseth,\" says the true scientific specialist, \"there am I blind\\r\\nand want also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want\\r\\nI also to be honest--namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel, and\\r\\ninexorable.\" Zarathustra greatly respecting this man, invites him too to\\r\\nthe cave, and then vanishes in answer to another cry for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXV. The Magician.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Magician is of course an artist, and Nietzsche\\'s intimate knowledge\\r\\nof perhaps the greatest artist of his age rendered the selection of\\r\\nWagner, as the type in this discourse, almost inevitable. Most readers\\r\\nwill be acquainted with the facts relating to Nietzsche\\'s and Wagner\\'s\\r\\nfriendship and ultimate separation. As a boy and a youth Nietzsche had\\r\\nshown such a remarkable gift for music that it had been a question at\\r\\none time whether he should not perhaps give up everything else in order\\r\\nto develop this gift, but he became a scholar notwithstanding, although\\r\\nhe never entirely gave up composing, and playing the piano. While\\r\\nstill in his teens, he became acquainted with Wagner\\'s music and\\r\\ngrew passionately fond of it. Long before he met Wagner he must have\\r\\nidealised him in his mind to an extent which only a profoundly artistic\\r\\nnature could have been capable of. Nietzsche always had high ideals for\\r\\nhumanity. If one were asked whether, throughout his many changes, there\\r\\nwas yet one aim, one direction, and one hope to which he held fast,\\r\\none would be forced to reply in the affirmative and declare that aim,\\r\\ndirection, and hope to have been \"the elevation of the type man.\"\\r\\nNow, when Nietzsche met Wagner he was actually casting about for an\\r\\nincarnation of his dreams for the German people, and we have only to\\r\\nremember his youth (he was twenty-one when he was introduced to Wagner),\\r\\nhis love of Wagner\\'s music, and the undoubted power of the great\\r\\nmusician\\'s personality, in order to realise how very uncritical his\\r\\nattitude must have been in the first flood of his enthusiasm. Again,\\r\\nwhen the friendship ripened, we cannot well imagine Nietzsche, the\\r\\nyounger man, being anything less than intoxicated by his senior\\'s\\r\\nattention and love, and we are therefore not surprised to find him\\r\\npressing Wagner forward as the great Reformer and Saviour of mankind.\\r\\n\"Wagner in Bayreuth\" (English Edition, 1909) gives us the best proof\\r\\nof Nietzsche\\'s infatuation, and although signs are not wanting in this\\r\\nessay which show how clearly and even cruelly he was sub-consciously\\r\\n\"taking stock\" of his friend--even then, the work is a record of what\\r\\ngreat love and admiration can do in the way of endowing the object\\r\\nof one\\'s affection with all the qualities and ideals that a fertile\\r\\nimagination can conceive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the blow came it was therefore all the more severe. Nietzsche\\r\\nat length realised that the friend of his fancy and the real Richard\\r\\nWagner--the composer of Parsifal--were not one; the fact dawned\\r\\nupon him slowly; disappointment upon disappointment, revelation after\\r\\nrevelation, ultimately brought it home to him, and though his best\\r\\ninstincts were naturally opposed to it at first, the revulsion of\\r\\nfeeling at last became too strong to be ignored, and Nietzsche was\\r\\nplunged into the blackest despair. Years after his break with Wagner,\\r\\nhe wrote \"The Case of Wagner\", and \"Nietzsche contra Wagner\", and these\\r\\nworks are with us to prove the sincerity and depth of his views on the\\r\\nman who was the greatest event of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poem in this discourse is, of course, reminiscent of Wagner\\'s own\\r\\npoetical manner, and it must be remembered that the whole was written\\r\\nsubsequent to Nietzsche\\'s final break with his friend. The dialogue\\r\\nbetween Zarathustra and the Magician reveals pretty fully what it\\r\\nwas that Nietzsche grew to loathe so intensely in Wagner,--viz., his\\r\\npronounced histrionic tendencies, his dissembling powers, his inordinate\\r\\nvanity, his equivocalness, his falseness. \"It honoureth thee,\" says\\r\\nZarathustra, \"that thou soughtest for greatness, but it betrayeth thee\\r\\nalso. Thou art not great.\" The Magician is nevertheless sent as a guest\\r\\nto Zarathustra\\'s cave; for, in his heart, Zarathustra believed until the\\r\\nend that the Magician was a higher man broken by modern values.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXVI. Out of Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra now meets the last pope, and, in a poetical form, we get\\r\\nNietzsche\\'s description of the course Judaism and Christianity pursued\\r\\nbefore they reached their final break-up in Atheism, Agnosticism, and\\r\\nthe like. The God of a strong, warlike race--the God of Israel--is a\\r\\njealous, revengeful God. He is a power that can be pictured and endured\\r\\nonly by a hardy and courageous race, a race rich enough to sacrifice and\\r\\nto lose in sacrifice. The image of this God degenerates with the people\\r\\nthat appropriate it, and gradually He becomes a God of love--\"soft and\\r\\nmellow,\" a lower middle-class deity, who is \"pitiful.\" He can no longer\\r\\nbe a God who requires sacrifice, for we ourselves are no longer rich\\r\\nenough for that. The tables are therefore turned upon Him; HE must\\r\\nsacrifice to us. His pity becomes so great that he actually does\\r\\nsacrifice something to us--His only begotten Son. Such a process\\r\\ncarried to its logical conclusions must ultimately end in His own\\r\\ndestruction, and thus we find the pope declaring that God was one day\\r\\nsuffocated by His all-too-great pity. What follows is clear enough.\\r\\nZarathustra recognises another higher man in the ex-pope and sends him\\r\\ntoo as a guest to the cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXVII. The Ugliest Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis discourse contains perhaps the boldest of Nietzsche\\'s suggestions\\r\\nconcerning Atheism, as well as some extremely penetrating remarks upon\\r\\nthe sentiment of pity. Zarathustra comes across the repulsive creature\\r\\nsitting on the wayside, and what does he do? He manifests the only\\r\\ncorrect feelings that can be manifested in the presence of any great\\r\\nmisery--that is to say, shame, reverence, embarrassment. Nietzsche\\r\\ndetested the obtrusive and gushing pity that goes up to misery without\\r\\na blush either on its cheek or in its heart--the pity which is only\\r\\nanother form of self-glorification. \"Thank God that I am not like\\r\\nthee!\"--only this self-glorifying sentiment can lend a well-constituted\\r\\nman the impudence to SHOW his pity for the cripple and the\\r\\nill-constituted. In the presence of the ugliest man Nietzsche\\r\\nblushes,--he blushes for his race; his own particular kind of\\r\\naltruism--the altruism that might have prevented the existence of this\\r\\nman--strikes him with all its force. He will have the world otherwise.\\r\\nHe will have a world where one need not blush for one\\'s fellows--hence\\r\\nhis appeal to us to love only our children\\'s land, the land undiscovered\\r\\nin the remotest sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nZarathustra calls the ugliest man the murderer of God! Certainly, this\\r\\nis one aspect of a certain kind of Atheism--the Atheism of the man who\\r\\nreveres beauty to such an extent that his own ugliness, which outrages\\r\\nhim, must be concealed from every eye lest it should not be respected as\\r\\nZarathustra respected it. If there be a God, He too must be evaded. His\\r\\npity must be foiled. But God is ubiquitous and omniscient. Therefore,\\r\\nfor the really GREAT ugly man, He must not exist. \"Their pity IS it from\\r\\nwhich I flee away,\" he says--that is to say: \"It is from their want of\\r\\nreverence and lack of shame in presence of my great misery!\" The ugliest\\r\\nman despises himself; but Zarathustra said in his Prologue: \"I love\\r\\nthe great despisers because they are the great adorers, and arrows of\\r\\nlonging for the other shore.\" He therefore honours the ugliest man: sees\\r\\nheight in his self-contempt, and invites him to join the other higher\\r\\nmen in the cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXVIII. The Voluntary Beggar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this discourse, we undoubtedly have the ideal Buddhist, if not\\r\\nGautama Buddha himself. Nietzsche had the greatest respect for Buddhism,\\r\\nand almost wherever he refers to it in his works, it is in terms of\\r\\npraise. He recognised that though Buddhism is undoubtedly a religion for\\r\\ndecadents, its decadent values emanate from the higher and not, as in\\r\\nChristianity, from the lower grades of society. In Aphorism 20 of \"The\\r\\nAntichrist\", he compares it exhaustively with Christianity, and\\r\\nthe result of his investigation is very much in favour of the older\\r\\nreligion. Still, he recognised a most decided Buddhistic influence\\r\\nin Christ\\'s teaching, and the words in verses 29, 30, and 31 are very\\r\\nreminiscent of his views in regard to the Christian Savior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure of Christ has been introduced often enough into fiction, and\\r\\nmany scholars have undertaken to write His life according to their own\\r\\nlights, but few perhaps have ever attempted to present Him to us bereft\\r\\nof all those characteristics which a lack of the sense of harmony has\\r\\nattached to His person through the ages in which His doctrines have been\\r\\ntaught. Now Nietzsche disagreed entirely with Renan\\'s view, that Christ\\r\\nwas \"le grand maitre en ironie\"; in Aphorism 31 of \"The Antichrist\",\\r\\nhe says that he (Nietzsche) always purged his picture of the Humble\\r\\nNazarene of all those bitter and spiteful outbursts which, in view of\\r\\nthe struggle the first Christians went through, may very well have been\\r\\nadded to the original character by Apologists and Sectarians who, at\\r\\nthat time, could ill afford to consider nice psychological points,\\r\\nseeing that what they needed, above all, was a wrangling and abusive\\r\\ndeity. These two conflicting halves in the character of the Christ of\\r\\nthe Gospels, which no sound psychology can ever reconcile, Nietzsche\\r\\nalways kept distinct in his own mind; he could not credit the same man\\r\\nwith sentiments sometimes so noble and at other times so vulgar, and\\r\\nin presenting us with this new portrait of the Saviour, purged of all\\r\\nimpurities, Nietzsche rendered military honours to a foe, which far\\r\\nexceed in worth all that His most ardent disciples have ever claimed for\\r\\nHim. In verse 26 we are vividly reminded of Herbert Spencer\\'s words \"\\'Le\\r\\nmariage de convenance\\' is legalised prostitution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXIX. The Shadow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we have a description of that courageous and wayward spirit that\\r\\nliterally haunts the footsteps of every great thinker and every great\\r\\nleader; sometimes with the result that it loses all aims, all hopes,\\r\\nand all trust in a definite goal. It is the case of the bravest and\\r\\nmost broad-minded men of to-day. These literally shadow the most daring\\r\\nmovements in the science and art of their generation; they completely\\r\\nlose their bearings and actually find themselves, in the end, without a\\r\\nway, a goal, or a home. \"On every surface have I already sat!...I become\\r\\nthin, I am almost equal to a shadow!\" At last, in despair, such men\\r\\ndo indeed cry out: \"Nothing is true; all is permitted,\" and then they\\r\\nbecome mere wreckage. \"Too much hath become clear unto me: now nothing\\r\\nmattereth to me any more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love,--how\\r\\nshould I still love myself! Have I still a goal? Where is MY home?\"\\r\\nZarathustra realises the danger threatening such a man. \"Thy danger is\\r\\nnot small, thou free spirit and wanderer,\" he says. \"Thou hast had a bad\\r\\nday. See that a still worse evening doth not overtake thee!\" The danger\\r\\nZarathustra refers to is precisely this, that even a prison may seem a\\r\\nblessing to such a man. At least the bars keep him in a place of rest;\\r\\na place of confinement, at its worst, is real. \"Beware lest in the end\\r\\na narrow faith capture thee,\" says Zarathustra, \"for now everything that\\r\\nis narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXX. Noontide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the noon of life Nietzsche said he entered the world; with him\\r\\nman came of age. We are now held responsible for our actions; our old\\r\\nguardians, the gods and demi-gods of our youth, the superstitions and\\r\\nfears of our childhood, withdraw; the field lies open before us; we\\r\\nlived through our morning with but one master--chance--; let us see to\\r\\nit that we MAKE our afternoon our own (see Note XLIX., Part III.).\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXI. The Greeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I think I may claim that my contention in regard to the purpose and\\r\\naim of the whole of Nietzsche\\'s philosophy (as stated at the beginning\\r\\nof my Notes on Part IV.) is completely upheld. He fought for \"all who\\r\\ndo not want to live, unless they learn again to HOPE--unless THEY learn\\r\\n(from him) the GREAT hope!\" Zarathustra\\'s address to his guests shows\\r\\nclearly enough how he wished to help them: \"I DO NOT TREAT MY WARRIORS\\r\\nINDULGENTLY,\" he says: \"how then could ye be fit for MY warfare?\" He\\r\\nrebukes and spurns them, no word of love comes from his lips. Elsewhere\\r\\nhe says a man should be a hard bed to his friend, thus alone can he be\\r\\nof use to him. Nietzsche would be a hard bed to higher men. He would\\r\\nmake them harder; for, in order to be a law unto himself, man must\\r\\npossess the requisite hardness. \"I wait for higher ones, stronger ones,\\r\\nmore triumphant ones, merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in\\r\\nbody and soul.\" He says in par. 6 of \"Higher Man\":--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ye higher men, think ye that I am here to put right what ye have put\\r\\nwrong? Or that I wished henceforth to make snugger couches for you\\r\\nsufferers? Or show you restless, miswandering, misclimbing ones new and\\r\\neasier footpaths?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nay! Nay! Three times nay! Always more, always better ones of your type\\r\\nshall succumb--for ye shall always have it worse and harder.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXII. The Supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first seven verses of this discourse, I cannot help seeing\\r\\na gentle allusion to Schopenhauer\\'s habits as a bon-vivant. For a\\r\\npessimist, be it remembered, Schopenhauer led quite an extraordinary\\r\\nlife. He ate well, loved well, played the flute well, and I believe he\\r\\nsmoked the best cigars. What follows is clear enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXIII. The Higher Man. Par. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nNietzsche admits, here, that at one time he had thought of appealing to\\r\\nthe people, to the crowd in the market-place, but that he had ultimately\\r\\nto abandon the task. He bids higher men depart from the market-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we are told quite plainly what class of men actually owe all their\\r\\nimpulses and desires to the instinct of self-preservation. The struggle\\r\\nfor existence is indeed the only spur in the case of such people.\\r\\nTo them it matters not in what shape or condition man be preserved,\\r\\nprovided only he survive. The transcendental maxim that \"Life per se is\\r\\nprecious\" is the ruling maxim here.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 4.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Note on Chapter LVII. (end) I speak of Nietzsche\\'s elevation of\\r\\nthe virtue, Courage, to the highest place among the virtues. Here he\\r\\ntells higher men the class of courage he expects from them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 5, 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese have already been referred to in the Notes on Chapters LVII. (end)\\r\\nand LXXI.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggest that the last verse in this paragraph strongly confirms the\\r\\nview that Nietzsche\\'s teaching was always meant by him to be esoteric\\r\\nand for higher man alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 9.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last verse, here, another shaft of light is thrown upon the\\r\\nImmaculate Perception or so-called \"pure objectivity\" of the scientific\\r\\nmind. \"Freedom from fever is still far from being knowledge.\" Where a\\r\\nman\\'s emotions cease to accompany him in his investigations, he is\\r\\nnot necessarily nearer the truth. Says Spencer, in the Preface to his\\r\\nAutobiography:--\"In the genesis of a system of thought, the emotional\\r\\nnature is a large factor: perhaps as large a factor as the intellectual\\r\\nnature\" (see pages 134, 141 of Vol. I., \"Thoughts out of Season\").\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 10, 11.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we approach Nietzsche\\'s philosophy we must be prepared to be\\r\\nindependent thinkers; in fact, the greatest virtue of his works is\\r\\nperhaps the subtlety with which they impose the obligation upon one\\r\\nof thinking alone, of scoring off one\\'s own bat, and of shifting\\r\\nintellectually for oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 13.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am a railing alongside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me, may\\r\\ngrasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.\" These two paragraphs are an\\r\\nexhortation to higher men to become independent.\\r\\n\\r\\nPar. 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Nietzsche perhaps exaggerates the importance of heredity. As,\\r\\nhowever, the question is by no means one on which we are all agreed,\\r\\nwhat he says is not without value.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very important principle in Nietzsche\\'s philosophy is enunciated in\\r\\nthe first verse of this paragraph. \"The higher its type, always the\\r\\nseldomer doth a thing succeed\" (see page 82 of \"Beyond Good and Evil\").\\r\\nThose who, like some political economists, talk in a business-like way\\r\\nabout the terrific waste of human life and energy, deliberately overlook\\r\\nthe fact that the waste most to be deplored usually occurs among\\r\\nhigher individuals. Economy was never precisely one of nature\\'s leading\\r\\nprinciples. All this sentimental wailing over the larger proportion\\r\\nof failures than successes in human life, does not seem to take into\\r\\naccount the fact that it is the rarest thing on earth for a highly\\r\\norganised being to attain to the fullest development and activity of all\\r\\nits functions, simply because it is so highly organised. The blind Will\\r\\nto Power in nature therefore stands in urgent need of direction by man.\\r\\n\\r\\nPars. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese paragraphs deal with Nietzsche\\'s protest against the democratic\\r\\nseriousness (Pobelernst) of modern times. \"All good things laugh,\" he\\r\\nsays, and his final command to the higher men is, \"LEARN, I pray you--to\\r\\nlaugh.\" All that is GOOD, in Nietzsche\\'s sense, is cheerful. To be able\\r\\nto crack a joke about one\\'s deepest feelings is the greatest test of\\r\\ntheir value. The man who does not laugh, like the man who does not make\\r\\nfaces, is already a buffoon at heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What hath hitherto been the greatest sin here on earth? Was it not the\\r\\nword of him who said: \\'Woe unto them that laugh now!\\' Did he himself\\r\\nfind no cause for laughter on the earth? Then he sought badly. A child\\r\\neven findeth cause for it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXIV. The Song of Melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his address to the higher men, Zarathustra goes out into the\\r\\nopen to recover himself. Meanwhile the magician (Wagner), seizing the\\r\\nopportunity in order to draw them all into his net once more, sings the\\r\\nSong of Melancholy.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXV. Science.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only one to resist the \"melancholy voluptuousness\" of his art, is\\r\\nthe spiritually conscientious one--the scientific specialist of whom we\\r\\nread in the discourse entitled \"The Leech\". He takes the harp from the\\r\\nmagician and cries for air, while reproving the musician in the style\\r\\nof \"The Case of Wagner\". When the magician retaliates by saying that the\\r\\nspiritually conscientious one could have understood little of his song,\\r\\nthe latter replies: \"Thou praisest me in that thou separatest me from\\r\\nthyself.\" The speech of the scientific man to his fellow higher men is\\r\\nwell worth studying. By means of it, Nietzsche pays a high tribute to\\r\\nthe honesty of the true specialist, while, in representing him as the\\r\\nonly one who can resist the demoniacal influence of the magician\\'s\\r\\nmusic, he elevates him at a stroke, above all those present. Zarathustra\\r\\nand the spiritually conscientious one join issue at the end on the\\r\\nquestion of the proper place of \"fear\" in man\\'s history, and Nietzsche\\r\\navails himself of the opportunity in order to restate his views\\r\\nconcerning the relation of courage to humanity. It is precisely because\\r\\ncourage has played the most important part in our development that\\r\\nhe would not see it vanish from among our virtues to-day. \"...courage\\r\\nseemeth to me the entire primitive history of man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXVI. Among the Daughters of the Desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis tells its own tale.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXVII. The Awakening.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this discourse, Nietzsche wishes to give his followers a warning.\\r\\nHe thinks he has so far helped them that they have become convalescent,\\r\\nthat new desires are awakened in them and that new hopes are in their\\r\\narms and legs. But he mistakes the nature of the change. True, he has\\r\\nhelped them, he has given them back what they most need, i.e., belief in\\r\\nbelieving--the confidence in having confidence in something, but how\\r\\ndo they use it? This belief in faith, if one can so express it without\\r\\nseeming tautological, has certainly been restored to them, and in\\r\\nthe first flood of their enthusiasm they use it by bowing down and\\r\\nworshipping an ass! When writing this passage, Nietzsche was obviously\\r\\nthinking of the accusations which were levelled at the early Christians\\r\\nby their pagan contemporaries. It is well known that they were supposed\\r\\nnot only to be eaters of human flesh but also ass-worshippers, and among\\r\\nthe Roman graffiti, the most famous is the one found on the Palatino,\\r\\nshowing a man worshipping a cross on which is suspended a figure\\r\\nwith the head of an ass (see Minucius Felix, \"Octavius\" IX.; Tacitus,\\r\\n\"Historiae\" v. 3; Tertullian, \"Apologia\", etc.). Nietzsche\\'s obvious\\r\\nmoral, however, is that great scientists and thinkers, once they have\\r\\nreached the wall encircling scepticism and have thereby learned to\\r\\nrecover their confidence in the act of believing, as such, usually\\r\\nmanifest the change in their outlook by falling victims to the narrowest\\r\\nand most superstitious of creeds. So much for the introduction of the\\r\\nass as an object of worship.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with regard to the actual service and Ass-Festival, no reader who\\r\\nhappens to be acquainted with the religious history of the Middle Ages\\r\\nwill fail to see the allusion here to the asinaria festa which were by\\r\\nno means uncommon in France, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe during the\\r\\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXVIII. The Ass-Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, in the middle of their feast, Zarathustra bursts in upon\\r\\nthem and rebukes them soundly. But he does not do so long; in the\\r\\nAss-Festival, it suddenly occurs to him, that he is concerned with a\\r\\nceremony that may not be without its purpose, as something foolish but\\r\\nnecessary--a recreation for wise men. He is therefore highly pleased\\r\\nthat the higher men have all blossomed forth; they therefore require\\r\\nnew festivals,--\"A little valiant nonsense, some divine service and\\r\\nass-festival, some old joyful Zarathustra fool, some blusterer to blow\\r\\ntheir souls bright.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tells them not to forget that night and the ass-festival, for \"such\\r\\nthings only the convalescent devise! And should ye celebrate it again,\"\\r\\nhe concludes, \"do it from love to yourselves, do it also from love to\\r\\nme! And in remembrance of ME!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXIX. The Drunken Song.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt were the height of presumption to attempt to fix any particular\\r\\ninterpretation of my own to the words of this song. With what has gone\\r\\nbefore, the reader, while reading it as poetry, should be able to seek\\r\\nand find his own meaning in it. The doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence\\r\\nappears for the last time here, in an art-form. Nietzsche lays stress\\r\\nupon the fact that all happiness, all delight, longs for repetitions,\\r\\nand just as a child cries \"Again! Again!\" to the adult who happens to\\r\\nbe amusing him; so the man who sees a meaning, and a joyful meaning, in\\r\\nexistence must also cry \"Again!\" and yet \"Again!\" to all his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter LXXX. The Sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this discourse, Nietzsche disassociates himself finally from the\\r\\nhigher men, and by the symbol of the lion, wishes to convey to us that\\r\\nhe has won over and mastered the best and the most terrible in nature.\\r\\nThat great power and tenderness are kin, was already his belief in\\r\\n1875--eight years before he wrote this speech, and when the birds and\\r\\nthe lion come to him, it is because he is the embodiment of the two\\r\\nqualities. All that is terrible and great in nature, the higher men are\\r\\nnot yet prepared for; for they retreat horror-stricken into the cave\\r\\nwhen the lion springs at them; but Zarathustra makes not a move towards\\r\\nthem. He was tempted to them on the previous day, he says, but \"That\\r\\nhath had its time! My suffering and my fellow suffering,--what matter\\r\\nabout them! Do I then strive after HAPPINESS? I strive after my work!\\r\\nWell! the lion hath come, my children are nigh. Zarathustra hath grown\\r\\nripe. MY day beginneth: ARISE NOW, ARISE, THOU GREAT NOONDAY!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above I know to be open to much criticism. I shall be grateful to\\r\\nall those who will be kind enough to show me where and how I have gone\\r\\nwrong; but I should like to point out that, as they stand, I have not\\r\\ngiven to these Notes by any means their final form.\\r\\n\\r\\nANTHONY M.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n',\n",

Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\\r\\nNorwood, Mass., U.S.A.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPREFACE\\r\\n\\r\\nAs there cannot be said to be a beaten path in philosophy, and as\\r\\n\"Introductions\" to the subject differ widely from one another, it is\\r\\nproper that I should give an indication of the scope of the present\\r\\nvolume.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt undertakes:--\\r\\n\\r\\n1.  To point out what the word \"philosophy\" is made to cover in our\\r\\nuniversities and colleges at the present day, and to show why it is\\r\\ngiven this meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n2.  To explain the nature of reflective or philosophical thinking, and\\r\\nto show how it differs from common thought and from science.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  To give a general view of the main problems with which philosophers\\r\\nhave felt called upon to deal.\\r\\n\\r\\n4.  To give an account of some of the more important types of\\r\\nphilosophical doctrine which have arisen out of the consideration of\\r\\nsuch problems.\\r\\n\\r\\n5.  To indicate the relation of philosophy to the so-called\\r\\nphilosophical sciences, and to the other sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.  To show, finally, that the study of philosophy is of value to us\\r\\nall, and to give some practical admonitions on spirit and method.  Had\\r\\nthese admonitions been impressed upon me at a time when I was in\\r\\nespecial need of guidance, I feel that they would have spared me no\\r\\nlittle anxiety and confusion of mind.  For this reason, I recommend\\r\\nthem to the attention of the reader.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the scope of my book.  It aims to tell what philosophy is.  It\\r\\nis not its chief object to advocate a particular type of doctrine.  At\\r\\nthe same time, as it is impossible to treat of the problems of\\r\\nphilosophy except from some point of view, it will be found that, in\\r\\nChapters III to XI, a doctrine is presented.  It is the same as that\\r\\npresented much more in detail, and with a greater wealth of reference,\\r\\nin my \"System of Metaphysics,\" which was published a short time ago.\\r\\nIn the Notes in the back of this volume, the reader will find\\r\\nreferences to those parts of the larger work which treat of the\\r\\nsubjects more briefly discussed here.  It will be helpful to the\\r\\nteacher to keep the larger work on hand, and to use more or less of the\\r\\nmaterial there presented as his undergraduate classes discuss the\\r\\nchapters of this one.  Other references are also given in the Notes,\\r\\nand it may be profitable to direct the attention of students to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present book has been made as clear and simple as possible, that no\\r\\nunnecessary difficulties may be placed in the path of those who enter\\r\\nupon the thorny road of philosophical reflection.  The subjects treated\\r\\nare deep enough to demand the serious attention of any one; and they\\r\\nare subjects of fascinating interest.  That they are treated simply and\\r\\nclearly does not mean that they are treated superficially.  Indeed,\\r\\nwhen a doctrine is presented in outline and in a brief and simple\\r\\nstatement, its meaning may be more readily apparent than when it is\\r\\ntreated more exhaustively.  For this reason, I especially recommend,\\r\\neven to those who are well acquainted with philosophy, the account of\\r\\nthe external world contained in Chapter IV.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the doctrine I advocate I am inclined to ask especial consideration\\r\\non the ground that it is, on the whole, a justification of the attitude\\r\\ntaken by the plain man toward the world in which he finds himself.  The\\r\\nexperience of the race is not a thing that we may treat lightly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, it is maintained that there is a real external world presented in\\r\\nour experience--not a world which we have a right to regard as the\\r\\nsensations or ideas of any mind.  It is maintained that we have\\r\\nevidence that there are minds in certain relations to that world, and\\r\\nthat we can, within certain limits, determine these relations.  It is\\r\\npointed out that the plain man\\'s belief in the activity of his mind and\\r\\nhis notion of the significance of purposes and ends are not without\\r\\njustification.  It is indicated that theism is a reasonable doctrine,\\r\\nand it is held that the human will is free in the only proper sense of\\r\\nthe word \"freedom.\"  Throughout it is taken for granted that the\\r\\nphilosopher has no private system of weights and measures, but must\\r\\nreason as other men reason, and must prove his conclusions in the same\\r\\nsober way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have written in hopes that the book may be of use to undergraduate\\r\\nstudents.  They are often repelled by philosophy, and I cannot but\\r\\nthink that this is in part due to the dry and abstract form in which\\r\\nphilosophers have too often seen fit to express their thoughts.  The\\r\\nsame thoughts can be set forth in plain language, and their\\r\\nsignificance illustrated by a constant reference to experiences which\\r\\nwe all have--experiences which must serve as the foundation to every\\r\\ntheory of the mind and the world worthy of serious consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are many persons who cannot attend formal courses of\\r\\ninstruction, and who, nevertheless, are interested in philosophy.\\r\\nThese, also, I have had in mind; and I have tried to be so clear that\\r\\nthey could read the work with profit in the absence of a teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, I invite the more learned, if they have found my \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics\" difficult to understand in any part, to follow the simple\\r\\nstatement contained in the chapters above alluded to, and then to\\r\\nreturn, if they will, to the more bulky volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGEORGE STUART FULLERTON.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York, 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART I\\r\\n\\r\\nINTRODUCTORY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MEANING OF THE WORD \"PHILOSOPHY\" IN THE PAST AND IN THE PRESENT\\r\\n\\r\\n   1.

INTRODUCTORY\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MEANING OF THE WORD \"PHILOSOPHY\" IN THE PAST AND IN THE PRESENT\\r\\n\\r\\nI must warn the reader at the outset that the title of this chapter\\r\\nseems to promise a great deal more than he will find carried out in the\\r\\nchapter itself.  To tell all that philosophy has meant in the past, and\\r\\nall that it means to various classes of men in the present, would be a\\r\\ntask of no small magnitude, and one quite beyond the scope of such a\\r\\nvolume as this.  But it is not impossible to give within small compass\\r\\na brief indication, at least, of what the word once signified, to show\\r\\nhow its signification has undergone changes, and to point out to what\\r\\nsort of a discipline or group of disciplines educated men are apt to\\r\\napply the word, notwithstanding their differences of opinion as to the\\r\\ntruth or falsity of this or that particular doctrine.  Why certain\\r\\nsubjects of investigation have come to be grouped together and to be\\r\\nregarded as falling within the province of the philosopher, rather than\\r\\ncertain other subjects, will, I hope, be made clear in the body of the\\r\\nwork.  Only an indication can be given in this chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. THE BEGINNINGS OF PHILOSOPHY.--The Greek historian Herodotus\\r\\n(484-424 B.C.) appears to have been the first to use the verb \"to\\r\\nphilosophize.\"  He makes Croesus tell Solon how he has heard that he\\r\\n\"from a desire of knowledge has, philosophizing, journeyed through many\\r\\nlands.\"  The word \"philosophizing\" seems to indicate that Solon pursued\\r\\nknowledge for its own sake, and was what we call an investigator.  As\\r\\nfor the word \"philosopher\" (etymologically, a lover of wisdom), a\\r\\ncertain somewhat unreliable tradition traces it back to Pythagoras\\r\\n(about 582-500 B.C.).  As told by Cicero, the story is that, in a\\r\\nconversation with Leon, the ruler of Phlius, in the Peloponnesus, he\\r\\ndescribed himself as a philosopher, and said that his business was an\\r\\ninvestigation into the nature of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, both the words \"philosopher\" and \"philosophy\" are freely\\r\\nused in the writings of the disciples of Socrates (470-399 B.C.), and\\r\\nit is possible that he was the first to make use of them.  The seeming\\r\\nmodesty of the title philosopher--for etymologically it is a modest\\r\\none, though it has managed to gather a very different signification\\r\\nwith the lapse of time--the modesty of the title would naturally appeal\\r\\nto a man who claimed so much ignorance, as Socrates; and Plato\\r\\nrepresents him as distinguishing between the lover of wisdom and the\\r\\nwise, on the ground that God alone may be called wise.  From that date\\r\\nto this the word \"philosopher\" has remained with us, and it has meant\\r\\nmany things to many men.  But for centuries the philosopher has not\\r\\nbeen simply the investigator, nor has he been simply the lover of\\r\\nwisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn investigation into the origin of words, however interesting in\\r\\nitself, can tell us little of the uses to which words are put after\\r\\nthey have come into being.  If we turn from etymology to history, and\\r\\nreview the labors of the men whom the world has agreed to call\\r\\nphilosophers, we are struck by the fact that those who head the list\\r\\nchronologically appear to have been occupied with crude physical\\r\\nspeculations, with attempts to guess what the world is made out of,\\r\\nrather than with that somewhat vague something that we call philosophy\\r\\nto-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents of the history of philosophy usually begin their studies with\\r\\nthe speculations of the Greek philosopher Thales (b. 624 B.C.).  We are\\r\\ntold that he assumed water to be the universal principle out of which\\r\\nall things are made, and that he maintained that \"all things are full\\r\\nof gods.\"  We find that Anaximander, the next in the list, assumed as\\r\\nthe source out of which all things proceed and that to which they all\\r\\nreturn \"the infinite and indeterminate\"; and that Anaximenes, who was\\r\\nperhaps his pupil, took as his principle the all-embracing air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis trio constitutes the Ionian school of philosophy, the earliest of\\r\\nthe Greek schools; and one who reads for the first time the few vague\\r\\nstatements which seem to constitute the sum of their contributions to\\r\\nhuman knowledge is impelled to wonder that so much has been made of the\\r\\nmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wonder disappears, however, when one realizes that the appearance\\r\\nof these thinkers was really a momentous thing.  For these men turned\\r\\ntheir faces away from the poetical and mythologic way of accounting for\\r\\nthings, which had obtained up to their time, and set their faces toward\\r\\nScience.  Aristotle shows us how Thales may have been led to the\\r\\nformulation of his main thesis by an observation of the phenomena of\\r\\nnature.  Anaximander saw in the world in which he lived the result of a\\r\\nprocess of evolution.  Anaximenes explains the coming into being of\\r\\nfire, wind, clouds, water, and earth, as due to a condensation and\\r\\nexpansion of the universal principle, air.  The boldness of their\\r\\nspeculations we may explain as due to a courage born of ignorance, but\\r\\nthe explanations they offer are scientific in spirit, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, these men do not stand alone.  They are the advance guard of\\r\\nan army whose latest representatives are the men who are enlightening\\r\\nthe world at the present day.  The evolution of science--taking that\\r\\nword in the broad sense to mean organized and systematized\\r\\nknowledge--must be traced in the works of the Greek philosophers from\\r\\nThales down.  Here we have the source and the rivulet to which we can\\r\\ntrace back the mighty stream which is flowing past our own doors.\\r\\nApparently insignificant in its beginnings, it must still for a while\\r\\nseem insignificant to the man who follows with an unreflective eye the\\r\\ncourse of the current.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would take me too far afield to give an account of the Greek schools\\r\\nwhich immediately succeeded the Ionic: to tell of the Pythagoreans, who\\r\\nheld that all things were constituted by numbers; of the Eleatics, who\\r\\nheld that \"only Being is,\" and denied the possibility of change,\\r\\nthereby reducing the shifting panorama of the things about us to a mere\\r\\ndelusive world of appearances; of Heraclitus, who was so impressed by\\r\\nthe constant flux of things that he summed up his view of nature in the\\r\\nwords: \"Everything flows\"; of Empedocles, who found his explanation of\\r\\nthe world in the combination of the four elements, since become\\r\\ntraditional, earth, water, fire, and air; of Democritus, who developed\\r\\na materialistic atomism which reminds one strongly of the doctrine of\\r\\natoms as it has appeared in modern science; of Anaxagoras, who traced\\r\\nthe system of things to the setting in order of an infinite\\r\\nmultiplicity of different elements,--\"seeds of things,\"--which setting\\r\\nin order was due to the activity of the finest of things, Mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a delight to discover the illuminating thoughts which came to the\\r\\nminds of these men; and, on the other hand, it is amusing to see how\\r\\nrecklessly they launched themselves on boundless seas when they were\\r\\nunprovided with chart and compass.  They were like brilliant children,\\r\\nwho know little of the dangers of the great world, but are ready to\\r\\nundertake anything.  These philosophers regarded all knowledge as their\\r\\nprovince, and did not despair of governing so great a realm.  They were\\r\\nready to explain the whole world and everything in it.  Of course, this\\r\\ncan only mean that they had little conception of how much there is to\\r\\nexplain, and of what is meant by scientific explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is characteristic of this series of philosophers that their\\r\\nattention was directed very largely upon the external world.  It was\\r\\nnatural that this should be so.  Both in the history of the race and in\\r\\nthat of the individual, we find that the attention is seized first by\\r\\nmaterial things, and that it is long before a clear conception of the\\r\\nmind and of its knowledge is arrived at.  Observation precedes\\r\\nreflection.  When we come to think definitely about the mind, we are\\r\\nall apt to make use of notions which we have derived from our\\r\\nexperience of external things.  The very words we use to denote mental\\r\\noperations are in many instances taken from this outer realm.  We\\r\\n\"direct\" the attention; we speak of \"apprehension,\" of \"conception,\" of\\r\\n\"intuition.\"  Our knowledge is \"clear\" or \"obscure\"; an oration is\\r\\n\"brilliant\"; an emotion is \"sweet\" or \"bitter.\"  What wonder that, as\\r\\nwe read over the fragments that have come down to us from the\\r\\nPre-Socratic philosophers, we should be struck by the fact that they\\r\\nsometimes leave out altogether and sometimes touch lightly upon a\\r\\nnumber of those things that we regard to-day as peculiarly within the\\r\\nprovince of the philosopher.  They busied themselves with the world as\\r\\nthey saw it, and certain things had hardly as yet come definitely\\r\\nwithin their horizon.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. THE GREEK PHILOSOPHY AT ITS HEIGHT.--The next succeeding period sees\\r\\ncertain classes of questions emerge into prominence which had attracted\\r\\ncomparatively little attention from the men of an earlier day.\\r\\nDemocritus of Abdera, to whom reference has been made above, belongs\\r\\nchronologically to this latter period, but his way of thinking makes us\\r\\nclass him with the earlier philosophers.  It was characteristic of\\r\\nthese latter that they assumed rather na\\xc3\\xafvely that man can look upon\\r\\nthe world and can know it, and can by thinking about it succeed in\\r\\ngiving a reasonable account of it.  That there may be a difference\\r\\nbetween the world as it really is and the world as it appears to man,\\r\\nand that it may be impossible for man to attain to a knowledge of the\\r\\nabsolute truth of things, does not seem to have occurred to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth century before Christ was, in Greece, a time of intense\\r\\nintellectual ferment.  One is reminded, in reading of it, of the\\r\\nsplendid years of the Renaissance in Italy, of the awakening of the\\r\\nhuman mind to a vigorous life which cast off the bonds of tradition and\\r\\ninsisted upon the right of free and unfettered development.  Athens was\\r\\nthe center of this intellectual activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this century arose the Sophists, public teachers who busied\\r\\nthemselves with all departments of human knowledge, but seemed to lay\\r\\nno little emphasis upon certain questions that touched very nearly the\\r\\nlife of man.  Can man attain to truth at all--to a truth that is more\\r\\nthan a mere truth to him, a seeming truth?  Whence do the laws derive\\r\\ntheir authority?  Is there such a thing as justice, as right?  It was\\r\\nwith such questions as these that the Sophists occupied themselves, and\\r\\nsuch questions as these have held the attention of mankind ever since.\\r\\nWhen they make their appearance in the life of a people or of an\\r\\nindividual man, it means that there has been a rebirth, a birth into\\r\\nthe life of reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Socrates, that greatest of teachers, felt called upon to refute\\r\\nthe arguments of these men, he met them, so to speak, on their own\\r\\nground, recognizing that the subjects of which they discoursed were,\\r\\nindeed, matter for scientific investigation.  His attitude seemed to\\r\\nmany conservative persons in his day a dangerous one; he was regarded\\r\\nas an innovator; he taught men to think and to raise questions where,\\r\\nbefore, the traditions of the fathers had seemed a sufficient guide to\\r\\nmen\\'s actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, he could not do otherwise.  Men had learned to reflect,\\r\\nand there had come into existence at least the beginnings of what we\\r\\nnow sometimes rather loosely call the mental and moral sciences.  In\\r\\nthe works of Socrates\\' disciple Plato (428-347 B.C.) and in those of\\r\\nPlato\\'s disciple Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), abundant justice is done to\\r\\nthese fields of human activity.  These two, the greatest among the\\r\\nGreek philosophers, differ from each other in many things, but it is\\r\\nworthy of remark that they both seem to regard the whole sphere of\\r\\nhuman knowledge as their province.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlato is much more interested in the moral sciences than in the\\r\\nphysical, but he, nevertheless, feels called upon to give an account of\\r\\nhow the world was made and out of what sort of elements.  He evidently\\r\\ndoes not take his own account very seriously, and recognizes that he is\\r\\non uncertain ground.  But he does not consider the matter beyond his\\r\\njurisdiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Aristotle, that wonderful man seems to have found it possible to\\r\\nrepresent worthily every science known to his time, and to have marked\\r\\nout several new fields for his successors to cultivate.  His philosophy\\r\\ncovers physics, cosmology, zo\\xc3\\xb6logy, logic, metaphysics, ethics,\\r\\npsychology, politics and economics, rhetoric and poetics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we see that the task of the philosopher was much the same at the\\r\\nperiod of the highest development of the Greek philosophy that it had\\r\\nbeen earlier.  He was supposed to give an account of the system of\\r\\nthings.  But the notion of what it means to give an account of the\\r\\nsystem of things had necessarily undergone some change.  The\\r\\nphilosopher had to be something more than a natural philosopher.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. PHILOSOPHY AS A GUIDE TO LIFE.--At the close of the fourth century\\r\\nbefore Christ there arose the schools of the Stoics, the Epicureans,\\r\\nand the Skeptics.  In them we seem to find a somewhat new conception of\\r\\nphilosophy--philosophy appears as chiefly a guide to life.  The Stoic\\r\\nemphasizes the necessity of living \"according to nature,\" and dwells\\r\\nupon the character of the wise man; the Epicurean furnishes certain\\r\\nselfish maxims for getting through life as pleasantly as possible; the\\r\\nSkeptic counsels apathy, an indifference to all things,--blessed is he\\r\\nwho expects nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, when we examine more closely these systems, we find a\\r\\nconception of philosophy not really so very different from that which\\r\\nhad obtained before.  We do not find, it is true, that disinterested\\r\\npassion for the attainment of truth which is the glory of science.  Man\\r\\nseems quite too much concerned with the problem of his own happiness or\\r\\nunhappiness; he has grown morbid.  Nevertheless, the practical maxims\\r\\nwhich obtain in each of these systems are based upon a certain view of\\r\\nthe system of things as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Stoic tells us of what the world consists; what was the beginning\\r\\nand what will be the end of things; what is the relation of the system\\r\\nof things to God.  He develops a physics and a logic as well as a\\r\\nsystem of ethics.  The Epicurean informs us that the world originated\\r\\nin a rain of atoms through space; he examines into the foundations of\\r\\nhuman knowledge; and he proceeds to make himself comfortable in a world\\r\\nfrom which he has removed those disturbing elements, the gods.  The\\r\\nSkeptic decides that there is no such thing as truth, before he\\r\\nenunciates the dogma that it is not worth while to worry about\\r\\nanything.  The philosophy of each school includes a view of the system\\r\\nof things as a whole.  The philosopher still regarded the universe of\\r\\nknowledge as his province.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. PHILOSOPHY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.--I cannot do more than mention\\r\\nNeo-Platonism, that half Greek and half Oriental system of doctrine\\r\\nwhich arose in the third century after Christ, the first system of\\r\\nimportance after the schools mentioned above.  But I must not pass it\\r\\nby without pointing out that the Neo-Platonic philosopher undertook to\\r\\ngive an account of the origin, development, and end of the whole system\\r\\nof things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Middle Ages there gradually grew up rather a sharp distinction\\r\\nbetween those things that can be known through the unaided reason and\\r\\nthose things that can only be known through a supernatural revelation.\\r\\nThe term \"philosophy\" came to be synonymous with knowledge attained by\\r\\nthe natural light of reason.  This seems to imply some sort of a\\r\\nlimitation to the task of the philosopher.  Philosophy is not\\r\\nsynonymous with all knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we must not forget to take note of the fact that philosophy, even\\r\\nwith this limitation, constitutes a pretty wide field.  It covers both\\r\\nthe physical and the moral sciences.  Nor should we omit to notice that\\r\\nthe scholastic philosopher was at the same time a theologian.  Albert\\r\\nthe Great and St. Thomas Aquinas, the famous scholastics of the\\r\\nthirteenth century, had to write a \"_Summa Theologiae_,\" or system of\\r\\ntheology, as well as to treat of the other departments of human\\r\\nknowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy were these men not overwhelmed with the task set them by the\\r\\ntradition of their time?  It was because the task was not, after all,\\r\\nso great as a modern man might conceive it to be.  Gil Blas, in Le\\r\\nSage\\'s famous romance, finds it possible to become a skilled physician\\r\\nin the twinkling of an eye, when Dr. Sangrado has imparted to him the\\r\\nsecret that the remedy for all diseases is to be found in bleeding the\\r\\npatient and in making him drink copiously of hot water.  When little is\\r\\nknown about things, it does not seem impossible for one man to learn\\r\\nthat little.  During the Middle Ages and the centuries preceding, the\\r\\nphysical sciences had a long sleep.  Men were much more concerned in\\r\\nthe thirteenth century to find out what Aristotle had said than they\\r\\nwere to address questions to nature.  The special sciences, as we now\\r\\nknow them, had not been called into existence.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. THE MODERN PHILOSOPHY.--The submission of men\\'s minds to the\\r\\nauthority of Aristotle and of the church gradually gave way.  A revival\\r\\nof learning set in.  Men turned first of all to a more independent\\r\\nchoice of authorities, and then rose to the conception of a philosophy\\r\\nindependent of authority, of a science based upon an observation of\\r\\nnature, of a science at first hand.  The special sciences came into\\r\\nbeing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old tradition of philosophy as universal knowledge remained.\\r\\nIf we pass over the men of the transition period and turn our attention\\r\\nto Francis Bacon (1561-1626) and Rene Descartes (1596-1650), the two\\r\\nwho are commonly regarded as heading the list of the modern\\r\\nphilosophers, we find both of them assigning to the philosopher an\\r\\nalmost unlimited field.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacon holds that philosophy has for its objects God, man, and nature,\\r\\nand he regards it as within his province to treat of \"_philosophia\\r\\nprima_\" (a sort of metaphysics, though he does not call it by this\\r\\nname), of logic, of physics and astronomy, of anthropology, in which he\\r\\nincludes psychology, of ethics, and of politics.  In short, he attempts\\r\\nto map out the whole field of human knowledge, and to tell those who\\r\\nwork in this corner of it or in that how they should set about their\\r\\ntask.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Descartes, he writes of the trustworthiness of human knowledge,\\r\\nof the existence of God, of the existence of an external world, of the\\r\\nhuman soul and its nature, of mathematics, physics, cosmology,\\r\\nphysiology, and, in short, of nearly everything discussed by the men of\\r\\nhis day.  No man can accuse this extraordinary Frenchman of a lack of\\r\\nappreciation of the special sciences which were growing up.  No one in\\r\\nhis time had a better right to be called a scientist in the modern\\r\\nsense of the term.  But it was not enough for him to be a mere\\r\\nmathematician, or even a worker in the physical sciences generally.  He\\r\\nmust be all that has been mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conception of philosophy as of a something that embraces all\\r\\ndepartments of human knowledge has not wholly passed away even in our\\r\\nday.  I shall not dwell upon Spinoza (1632-1677), who believed it\\r\\npossible to deduce a world _a priori_ with mathematical precision; upon\\r\\nChristian Wolff (1679-1754), who defined philosophy as the knowledge of\\r\\nthe causes of what is or comes into being; upon Fichte (1762-1814), who\\r\\nbelieved that the philosopher, by mere thinking, could lay down the\\r\\nlaws of all possible future experience; upon Schelling (1775-1854),\\r\\nwho, without knowing anything worth mentioning about natural science,\\r\\nhad the courage to develop a system of natural philosophy, and to\\r\\ncondemn such investigators as Boyle and Newton; upon Hegel (1770-1831),\\r\\nwho undertakes to construct the whole system of reality out of\\r\\nconcepts, and who, with his immediate predecessors, brought philosophy\\r\\nfor a while into more or less disrepute with men of a scientific turn\\r\\nof mind.  I shall come down quite to our own times, and consider a man\\r\\nwhose conception of philosophy has had and still has a good deal of\\r\\ninfluence, especially with the general public--with those to whom\\r\\nphilosophy is a thing to be taken up in moments of leisure, and cannot\\r\\nbe the serious pursuit of a life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Knowledge of the lowest kind,\" says Herbert Spencer, \"is _un-unified_\\r\\nknowledge; Science is _partially-unified_ knowledge; Philosophy is\\r\\n_completely-unified_ knowledge.\" [1]  Science, he argues, means merely\\r\\nthe family of the Sciences--stands for nothing more than the sum of\\r\\nknowledge formed of their contributions.  Philosophy is the fusion of\\r\\nthese contributions into a whole; it is knowledge of the greatest\\r\\ngenerality.  In harmony with this notion Spencer produced a system of\\r\\nphilosophy which includes the following: A volume entitled \"First\\r\\nPrinciples,\" which undertakes to show what man can and what man cannot\\r\\nknow; a treatise on the principles of biology; another on the\\r\\nprinciples of psychology; still another on the principles of sociology;\\r\\nand finally one on the principles of morality.  To complete the scheme\\r\\nit would have been necessary to give an account of inorganic nature\\r\\nbefore going on to the phenomena of life, but our philosopher found the\\r\\ntask too great and left this out.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Spencer was a man of genius, and one finds in his works many\\r\\nilluminating thoughts.  But it is worthy of remark that those who\\r\\npraise his work in this or in that field are almost always men who have\\r\\nthemselves worked in some other field and have an imperfect\\r\\nacquaintance with the particular field that they happen to be praising.\\r\\nThe metaphysician finds the reasonings of the \"First Principles\" rather\\r\\nloose and inconclusive; the biologist pays little heed to the\\r\\n\"Principles of Biology\"; the sociologist finds Spencer not particularly\\r\\naccurate or careful in the field of his predilection.  He has tried to\\r\\nbe a professor of all the sciences, and it is too late in the world\\'s\\r\\nhistory for him or for any man to cope with such a task.  In the days\\r\\nof Plato a man might have hoped to accomplish it.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. WHAT PHILOSOPHY MEANS IN OUR TIME.--It savors of temerity to write\\r\\ndown such a title as that which heads the present section.  There are\\r\\nmen living to-day to whom philosophy means little else than the\\r\\ndoctrine of Kant, or of Hegel, or of the brothers Caird, or of Herbert\\r\\nSpencer, or even of St. Thomas Aquinas, for we must not forget that\\r\\nmany of the seminaries of learning in Europe and some in America still\\r\\nhold to the mediaeval church philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let me gather up in a few words the purport of what has been said\\r\\nabove.  Philosophy once meant the whole body of scientific knowledge.\\r\\nAfterward it came to mean the whole body of knowledge which could be\\r\\nattained by the mere light of human reason, unaided by revelation.  The\\r\\nseveral special sciences sprang up, and a multitude of men have for a\\r\\nlong time past devoted themselves to definite limited fields of\\r\\ninvestigation with little attention to what has been done in other\\r\\nfields.  Nevertheless, there has persisted the notion of a discipline\\r\\nwhich somehow concerns itself with the whole system of things, rather\\r\\nthan with any limited division of that broad field.  It is a notion not\\r\\npeculiar to the disciples of Spencer.  There are many to whom\\r\\nphilosophy is a \"_Weltweisheit_,\" a world-wisdom.  Shall we say that\\r\\nthis is the meaning of the word philosophy now?  And if we do, how\\r\\nshall we draw a line between philosophy and the body of the special\\r\\nsciences?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most just way to get a preliminary idea of what philosophy\\r\\nmeans to the men of our time is to turn away for the time being from\\r\\nthe definition of any one man or group of men, and to ask ourselves\\r\\nwhat a professor of philosophy in an American or European university is\\r\\nactually supposed to teach.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite clear that he is not supposed to be an Aristotle.  He does\\r\\nnot represent all the sciences, and no one expects him to lecture on\\r\\nmathematics, mechanics, physics, chemistry, zo\\xc3\\xb6logy, botany, economics,\\r\\npolitics, and various other disciplines.  There was a time when he\\r\\nmight have been expected to teach all that men could know, but that\\r\\ntime is long past.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, there is quite a group of sciences which are regarded as\\r\\nbelonging especially to his province; and although a man may devote a\\r\\nlarge part of his attention to some one portion of the field, he would\\r\\ncertainly be thought remiss if he wholly neglected the rest.  This\\r\\ngroup of sciences includes logic, psychology, ethics and aesthetics,\\r\\nmetaphysics, and the history of philosophy.  I have not included\\r\\nepistemology or the \"theory of knowledge\" as a separate discipline, for\\r\\nreasons which will appear later (Chapter XIX); and I have included the\\r\\nhistory of philosophy, because, whether we care to call this a special\\r\\nscience or not, it constitutes a very important part of the work of the\\r\\nteacher of philosophy in our day.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf this group of subjects the student who goes to the university to\\r\\nstudy philosophy is supposed to know something before he leaves its\\r\\nwalls, whatever else he may or may not know.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be remarked, again, that there is commonly supposed to be a\\r\\npeculiarly close relation between philosophy and religion.  Certainly,\\r\\nif any one about a university undertakes to give a course of lectures\\r\\non theism, it is much more apt to be the professor of philosophy than\\r\\nthe professor of mathematics or of chemistry.  The man who has written\\r\\nan \"Introduction to Philosophy,\" a \"Psychology,\" a \"Logic,\" and an\\r\\n\"Outlines of Metaphysics\" is very apt to regard it as his duty to add\\r\\nto the list a \"Philosophy of Religion.\"  The students in the\\r\\ntheological seminaries of Europe and America are usually encouraged, if\\r\\nnot compelled, to attend courses in philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, it appears to be definitely accepted that even the disciplines\\r\\nthat we never think of classing among the philosophical sciences are\\r\\nnot wholly cut off from a connection with philosophy.  When we are\\r\\noccupied, not with adding to the stock of knowledge embraced within the\\r\\nsphere of any special science, but with an examination of the methods\\r\\nof the science, with, so to speak, a criticism of the foundations upon\\r\\nwhich the science rests, our work is generally recognized as\\r\\nphilosophical.  It strikes no one as odd in our day that there should\\r\\nbe established a \"Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific\\r\\nMethods,\" but we should think it strange if some one announced the\\r\\nintention to publish a \"Journal of Philosophy and Comparative Anatomy.\"\\r\\nIt is not without its significance that, when Mach, who had been\\r\\nprofessor of physics at Prague, was called (in 1895) to the University\\r\\nof Vienna to lecture on the history and theory of the inductive\\r\\nsciences, he was made, not professor of physics, but professor of\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case, then, stands thus: a certain group of disciplines is regarded\\r\\nas falling peculiarly within the province of the professor of\\r\\nphilosophy, and the sciences which constitute it are frequently called\\r\\nthe philosophical sciences; moreover, it is regarded as quite proper\\r\\nthat the teacher of philosophy should concern himself with the problems\\r\\nof religion, and should pry into the methods and fundamental\\r\\nassumptions of special sciences in all of which it is impossible that\\r\\nhe should be an adept.  The question naturally arises: Why has his task\\r\\ncome to be circumscribed as it is?  Why should he teach just these\\r\\nthings and no others?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question certain persons are at once ready to give an answer.\\r\\nThere was a time, they argue, when it seemed possible for one man to\\r\\nembrace the whole field of human knowledge.  But human knowledge grew;\\r\\nthe special sciences were born; each concerned itself with a definite\\r\\nclass of facts and developed its own methods.  It became possible and\\r\\nnecessary for a man to be, not a scientist at large, but a chemist, a\\r\\nphysicist, a biologist, an economist.  But in certain portions of the\\r\\ngreat field men have met with peculiar difficulties; here it cannot be\\r\\nsaid that we have sciences, but rather that we have attempts at\\r\\nscience.  The philosopher is the man to whom is committed what is left\\r\\nwhen we have taken away what has been definitely established or is\\r\\nundergoing investigation according to approved scientific methods.  He\\r\\nis Lord of the Uncleared Ground, and may wander through it in his\\r\\ncompassless, irresponsible way, never feeling that he is lost, for he\\r\\nhas never had any definite bearings to lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who argue in this way support their case by pointing to the lack\\r\\nof a general consensus of opinion which obtains in many parts of the\\r\\nfield which the philosopher regards as his own; and also by pointing\\r\\nout that, even within this field, there is a growing tendency on the\\r\\npart of certain sciences to separate themselves from philosophy and\\r\\nbecome independent.  Thus the psychologist and the logician are\\r\\nsometimes very anxious to have it understood that they belong among the\\r\\nscientists and not among the philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this answer to the question that we have raised undoubtedly\\r\\ncontains some truth.  As we have seen from the sketch contained in the\\r\\npreceding pages, the word philosophy was once a synonym for the whole\\r\\nsum of the sciences or what stood for such; gradually the several\\r\\nsciences have become independent and the field of the philosopher has\\r\\nbeen circumscribed.  We must admit, moreover, that there is to be found\\r\\nin a number of the special sciences a body of accepted facts which is\\r\\nwithout its analogue in philosophy.  In much of his work the\\r\\nphilosopher certainly seems to be walking upon more uncertain ground\\r\\nthan his neighbors; and if he is unaware of that fact, it must be\\r\\neither because he has not a very nice sense of what constitutes\\r\\nscientific evidence, or because he is carried away by his enthusiasm\\r\\nfor some particular form of doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, it is just to maintain that the answer we are discussing\\r\\nis not a satisfactory one.  For one thing, we find in it no indication\\r\\nof the reason why the particular group of disciplines with which the\\r\\nphilosopher occupies himself has been left to him, when so many\\r\\nsciences have announced their independence.  Why have not these, also,\\r\\nseparated off and set up for themselves?  Is it more difficult to work\\r\\nin these fields than in others? and, if so, what reason can be assigned\\r\\nfor the fact?\\r\\n\\r\\nTake psychology as an instance.  How does it happen that the physicist\\r\\ncalmly develops his doctrine without finding it necessary to make his\\r\\nbow to philosophy at all, while the psychologist is at pains to explain\\r\\nthat his book is to treat psychology as \"a natural science,\" and will\\r\\navoid metaphysics as much as possible?  For centuries men have been\\r\\ninterested in the phenomena of the human mind.  Can anything be more\\r\\nopen to observation than what passes in a man\\'s own consciousness?\\r\\nWhy, then, should the science of psychology lag behind? and why these\\r\\nendless disputes as to whether it can really be treated as a \"natural\\r\\nscience\" at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  May we assume that, because certain disciplines have taken a\\r\\nposition of relative independence, therefore all the rest of the field\\r\\nwill surely come to be divided up in the same way, and that there will\\r\\nbe many special sciences, but no such thing as philosophy?  It is hasty\\r\\nto assume this on no better evidence than that which has so far been\\r\\npresented.  Before making up one\\'s mind upon this point, one should\\r\\ntake a careful look at the problems with which the philosopher occupies\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\nA complete answer to the questions raised above can only be given in\\r\\nthe course of the book, where the main problems of philosophy are\\r\\ndiscussed, and the several philosophical sciences are taken up and\\r\\nexamined.  But I may say, in anticipation, as much as this:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) Philosophy is reflective knowledge.  What is meant by reflective\\r\\nknowledge will be explained at length in the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) The sciences which are grouped together as philosophical are those\\r\\nin which we are forced back upon the problems of reflective thought,\\r\\nand cannot simply put them aside.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) The peculiar difficulties of reflective thought may account for the\\r\\nfact that these sciences are, more than others, a field in which we may\\r\\nexpect to find disputes and differences of opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) We need not be afraid that the whole field of human knowledge will\\r\\ncome to be so divided up into special sciences that philosophy will\\r\\ndisappear.  The problems with which the philosopher occupies himself\\r\\nare real problems, which present themselves unavoidably to the\\r\\nthoughtful mind, and it is not convenient to divide these up among the\\r\\nseveral sciences.  This will become clearer as we proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"First Principles,\" Part II, section 37.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMMON THOUGHT, SCIENCE, AND REFLECTIVE THOUGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n7. COMMON THOUGHT.--Those who have given little attention to the study\\r\\nof the human mind are apt to suppose that, when the infant opens its\\r\\neyes upon the new world of objects surrounding its small body, it sees\\r\\nthings much as they do themselves.  They are ready to admit that it\\r\\ndoes not know much _about_ things, but it strikes them as absurd for\\r\\nany one to go so far as to say that it does not see things--the things\\r\\nout there in space before its eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the psychologist tells us that it requires quite a course\\r\\nof education to enable us to see things--not to have vague and\\r\\nunmeaning sensations, but to see things, things that are known to be\\r\\ntouchable as well as seeable, things that are recognized as having size\\r\\nand shape and position in space.  And he aims a still severer blow at\\r\\nour respect for the infant when he goes on to inform us that the little\\r\\ncreature is as ignorant of itself as it is of things; that in its small\\r\\nworld of as yet unorganized experiences there is no self that is\\r\\ndistinguished from other things; that it may cry vociferously without\\r\\nknowing who is uncomfortable, and may stop its noise without knowing\\r\\nwho has been taken up into the nurse\\'s arms and has experienced an\\r\\nagreeable change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chaotic little world of the dawning life is not our world, the\\r\\nworld of common thought, the world in which we all live and move in\\r\\nmaturer years; nor can we go back to it on the wings of memory.  We\\r\\nseem to ourselves to have always lived in a world of things,--things in\\r\\ntime and space, material things.  Among these things there is one of\\r\\npeculiar interest, and which we have not placed upon a par with the\\r\\nrest, our own body, which sees, tastes, touches, other things.  We\\r\\ncannot remember a time when we did not know that with this body are\\r\\nsomehow bound up many experiences which interest us acutely; for\\r\\nexample, experiences of pleasure and pain.  Moreover, we seem always to\\r\\nhave known that certain of the bodies which surround our own rather\\r\\nresemble our own, and are in important particulars to be distinguished\\r\\nfrom the general mass of bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we seem always to have been living in a world of _things_ and to\\r\\nhave recognized in that world the existence of ourselves and of other\\r\\npeople.  When we now think of \"ourselves\" and of \"other people,\" we\\r\\nthink of each of the objects referred to as possessing a _mind_.  May\\r\\nwe say that, as far back as we can remember, we have thought of\\r\\nourselves and of other persons as possessing minds?\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly.  The young child does not seem to distinguish between mind and\\r\\nbody, and, in the vague and fragmentary pictures which come back to us\\r\\nfrom our early life, certainly this distinction does not stand out.\\r\\nThe child may be the completest of egoists, it may be absorbed in\\r\\nitself and all that directly concerns this particular self, and yet it\\r\\nmay make no conscious distinction between a bodily self and a mental,\\r\\nbetween mind and body.  It does not explicitly recognize its world as a\\r\\nworld that contains minds as well as bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, however it may be with the child in the earlier stages of its\\r\\ndevelopment, we must all admit that the mature man does consciously\\r\\nrecognize that the world in which he finds himself is a world that\\r\\ncontains minds as well as bodies.  It never occurs to him to doubt that\\r\\nthere are bodies, and it never occurs to him to doubt that there are\\r\\nminds.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes he not perceive that he has a body and a mind?  Has he not\\r\\nabundant evidence that his mind is intimately related to his body?\\r\\nWhen he shuts his eyes, he no longer sees, and when he stops his ears,\\r\\nhe no longer hears; when his body is bruised, he feels pain; when he\\r\\nwills to raise his hand, his body carries out the mental decree.  Other\\r\\nmen act very much as he does; they walk and they talk, they laugh and\\r\\nthey cry, they work and they play, just as he does.  In short, they act\\r\\nprecisely as though they had minds like his own.  What more natural\\r\\nthan to assume that, as he himself gives expression, by the actions of\\r\\nhis body, to the thoughts and emotions in his mind, so his neighbor\\r\\ndoes the same?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not allow ourselves to underrate the plain man\\'s knowledge\\r\\neither of bodies or of minds.  It seems, when one reflects upon it, a\\r\\nsufficiently wonderful thing that a few fragmentary sensations should\\r\\nautomatically receive an interpretation which conjures up before the\\r\\nmind a world of real things; that, for example, the little patch of\\r\\ncolor sensation which I experience when I turn my eyes toward the\\r\\nwindow should seem to introduce me at once to a world of material\\r\\nobjects lying in space, clearly defined in magnitude, distance, and\\r\\ndirection; that an experience no more complex should be the key which\\r\\nshould unlock for me the secret storehouse of another mind, and lay\\r\\nbefore me a wealth of thoughts and emotions not my own.  From the poor,\\r\\nbare, meaningless world of the dawning intelligence to the world of\\r\\ncommon thought, a world in which real things with their manifold\\r\\nproperties, things material and things mental, bear their part, is\\r\\nindeed a long step.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd we should never forget that he who would go farther, he who would\\r\\nstrive to gain a better knowledge of matter and of mind by the aid of\\r\\nscience and of philosophical reflection, must begin his labors on this\\r\\nfoundation which is common to us all.  How else can he begin than by\\r\\naccepting and more critically examining the world as it seems revealed\\r\\nin the experience of the race?\\r\\n\\r\\n8. SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.--Still, the knowledge of the world which we\\r\\nhave been discussing is rather indefinite, inaccurate, and\\r\\nunsystematic.  It is a sufficient guide for common life, but its\\r\\ndeficiencies may be made apparent.  He who wishes to know matter and\\r\\nmind better cannot afford to neglect the sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is important to observe that although, when the plain man grows\\r\\nscientific, great changes take place in his knowledge of things, yet\\r\\nhis way of looking at the mind and the world remains in general much\\r\\nwhat it was before.  To prevent this statement from being\\r\\nmisunderstood, I must explain it at some length.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us suppose that the man in question takes up the study of botany.\\r\\nNeed he do anything very different from what is done more imperfectly\\r\\nby every intelligent man who interests himself in plants?  There in the\\r\\nreal material world before him are the same plants that he observed\\r\\nsomewhat carelessly before.  He must collect his information more\\r\\nsystematically and must arrange it more critically, but his task is not\\r\\nso much to do something different as it is to do the same thing much\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same is evidently true of various other sciences, such as geology,\\r\\nzo\\xc3\\xb6logy, physiology, sociology.  Some men have much accurate\\r\\ninformation regarding rocks, animals, the functions of the bodily\\r\\norgans, the development of a given form of society, and other things of\\r\\nthe sort, and other men have but little; and yet it is usually not\\r\\ndifficult for the man who knows much to make the man who knows little\\r\\nunderstand, at least, what he is talking about.  He is busying himself\\r\\nwith _things_--the same things that interest the plain man, and of\\r\\nwhich the plain man knows something.  He has collected information\\r\\ntouching their properties, their changes, their relationships; but to\\r\\nhim, as to his less scientific neighbor, they are the same things they\\r\\nalways were,--things that he has known from the days of childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps it will be admitted that this is true of such sciences as those\\r\\nabove indicated, but doubted whether it is true of all the sciences,\\r\\neven of all the sciences which are directly concerned with _things_ of\\r\\n_some_ sort.  For example, to the plain man the world of material\\r\\nthings consists of things that can be seen and touched.  Many of these\\r\\nseem to fill space continuously.  They may be divided, but the parts\\r\\ninto which they may be divided are conceived as fragments of the\\r\\nthings, and as of the same general nature as the wholes of which they\\r\\nare parts.  Yet the chemist and the physicist tell us that these same\\r\\nextended things are not really continuous, as they seem to us to be,\\r\\nbut consist of swarms of imperceptible atoms, in rapid motion, at\\r\\nconsiderable distances from one another in space, and grouped in\\r\\nvarious ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has now become of the world of realities to which the plain man\\r\\npinned his faith?  It has come to be looked upon as a world of\\r\\nappearances, of phenomena, of manifestations, under which the real\\r\\nthings, themselves imperceptible, make their presence evident to our\\r\\nsenses.  Is this new, real world the world of things in which the plain\\r\\nman finds himself, and in which he has felt so much at home?\\r\\n\\r\\nA closer scrutiny reveals that the world of atoms and molecules into\\r\\nwhich the man of science resolves the system of material things is not,\\r\\nafter all, so very different in kind from the world to which the plain\\r\\nman is accustomed.  He can understand without difficulty the language\\r\\nin which it is described to him, and he can readily see how a man may\\r\\nbe led to assume its existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe atom is not, it is true, directly perceivable by sense, but it is\\r\\nconceived as though it and its motions were thus perceivable.  The\\r\\nplain man has long known that things consist of parts which remain,\\r\\nunder some circumstances, invisible.  When he approaches an object from\\r\\na distance, he sees parts which he could not see before; and what\\r\\nappears to the naked eye a mere speck without perceptible parts is\\r\\nfound under the microscope to be an insect with its full complement of\\r\\nmembers.  Moreover, he has often observed that objects which appear\\r\\ncontinuous when seen from a distance are evidently far from continuous\\r\\nwhen seen close at hand.  As we walk toward a tree we can see the\\r\\nindefinite mass of color break up into discontinuous patches; a fabric,\\r\\nwhich presents the appearance of an unbroken surface when viewed in\\r\\ncertain ways may be seen to be riddled with holes when held between the\\r\\neye and the light.  There is no man who has not some acquaintance with\\r\\nthe distinction between appearance and reality, and who does not make\\r\\nuse of the distinction in common life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor can it seem a surprising fact that different combinations of atoms\\r\\nshould exhibit different properties.  Have we not always known that\\r\\nthings in combination are apt to have different properties from the\\r\\nsame things taken separately?  He who does not know so much as this is\\r\\nnot fit even to be a cook.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, the imperceptible world of atoms and molecules is not by any means\\r\\ntotally different from the world of things in which the plain man\\r\\nlives.  These little objects and groups of objects are discussed very\\r\\nmuch as we discuss the larger objects and groups of objects to which we\\r\\nare accustomed.  We are still concerned with _things_ which exist in\\r\\nspace and move about in space; and even if these things are small and\\r\\nare not very familiarly known, no intellectual revolution is demanded\\r\\nto enable a man to understand the words of the scientist who is talking\\r\\nabout them, and to understand as well the sort of reasonings upon which\\r\\nthe doctrine is based.\\r\\n\\r\\n9. MATHEMATICS.--Let us now turn to take a glance at the mathematical\\r\\nsciences.  Of course, these have to do with things sooner or later, for\\r\\nour mathematical reasonings would be absolutely useless to us if they\\r\\ncould not be applied to the world of things; but in mathematical\\r\\nreasonings we abstract from things for the time being, confident that\\r\\nwe can come back to them when we want to do so, and can make use of the\\r\\nresults obtained in our operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, every civilized man who is not mentally deficient can perform the\\r\\nfundamental operations of arithmetic.  He can add and subtract,\\r\\nmultiply and divide.  In other words, he can use _numbers_.  The man\\r\\nwho has become an accomplished mathematician can use numbers much\\r\\nbetter; but if we are capable of following intelligently the intricate\\r\\nseries of operations that he carries out on the paper before us, and\\r\\ncan see the significance of the system of signs which he uses as an\\r\\naid, we shall realize that he is only doing in more complicated ways\\r\\nwhat we have been accustomed to do almost from our childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are interested, not so much in performing the operations, as in\\r\\ninquiring into what really takes place in a mind when several units are\\r\\ngrasped together and made into a new unit,--for example, when twelve\\r\\nunits are thought as one dozen,--the mathematician has a right to say:\\r\\nI leave all that to the psychologist or to the metaphysician; every one\\r\\nknows in a general way what is meant by a unit, and knows that units\\r\\ncan be added and subtracted, grouped and separated; I only undertake to\\r\\nshow how one may avoid error in doing these things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is with geometry as it is with arithmetic.  No man is wholly\\r\\nignorant of points, lines, surfaces, and solids.  We are all aware that\\r\\na short line is not a point, a narrow surface is not a line, and a thin\\r\\nsolid is not a mere surface.  A door so thin as to have only one side\\r\\nwould be repudiated by every man of sense as a monstrosity.  When the\\r\\ngeometrician defines for us the point, the line, the surface, and the\\r\\nsolid, and when he sets before us an array of axioms, or self-evident\\r\\ntruths, we follow him with confidence because he seems to be telling us\\r\\nthings that we can directly see to be reasonable; indeed, to be telling\\r\\nus things that we have always known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is that the geometrician does not introduce us to a new world\\r\\nat all.  He merely gives us a fuller and a more exact account than was\\r\\nbefore within our reach of the space relations which obtain in the\\r\\nworld of external objects, a world we already know pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose that we say to him: You have spent many years in dividing up\\r\\nspace and in scrutinizing the relations that are to be discovered in\\r\\nthat realm; now tell us, what is space?  Is it real?  Is it a thing, or\\r\\na quality of a thing, or merely a relation between things?  And how can\\r\\nany man think space, when the ideas through which he must think it are\\r\\nsupposed to be themselves non-extended?  The space itself is not\\r\\nsupposed to be in the mind; how can a collection of non-extended ideas\\r\\ngive any inkling of what is meant by extension?\\r\\n\\r\\nWould any teacher of mathematics dream of discussing these questions\\r\\nwith his class before proceeding to the proof of his propositions?  It\\r\\nis generally admitted that, if such questions are to be answered at\\r\\nall, it is not with the aid of geometrical reasonings that they will be\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n10. THE SCIENCE OF PSYCHOLOGY.--Now let us come back to a science which\\r\\nhas to do directly with things.  We have seen that the plain man has\\r\\nsome knowledge of minds as well as of material things.  Every one\\r\\nadmits that the psychologist knows minds better.  May we say that his\\r\\nknowledge of minds differs from that of the plain man about as the\\r\\nknowledge of plants possessed by the botanist differs from that of all\\r\\nintelligent persons who have cared to notice them?  Or is it a\\r\\nknowledge of a quite different kind?\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who are familiar with the development of the sciences within\\r\\nrecent years have had occasion to remark the fact that psychology has\\r\\nbeen coming more and more to take its place as an independent science.\\r\\nFormerly it was regarded as part of the duty of the philosopher to\\r\\ntreat of the mind and its knowledge; but the psychologist who pretends\\r\\nto be no more than a psychologist is a product of recent times.  This\\r\\ntendency toward specialization is a natural thing, and is quite in line\\r\\nwith what has taken place in other fields of investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen any science becomes an independent discipline, it is recognized\\r\\nthat it is a more or less limited field in which work of a certain kind\\r\\nis done in a certain way.  Other fields and other kinds of work are to\\r\\nsome extent ignored.  But it is quite to be expected that there should\\r\\nbe some dispute, especially at first, as to what does or does not\\r\\nproperly fall within the limits of a given science.  Where these limits\\r\\nshall be placed is, after all, a matter of convenience; and sometimes\\r\\nit is not well to be too strict in marking off one field from another.\\r\\nIt is well to watch the actual development of a science, and to note\\r\\nthe direction instinctively taken by investigators in that particular\\r\\nfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we compare the psychology of a generation or so ago with that of the\\r\\npresent day, we cannot but be struck with the fact that there is an\\r\\nincreasing tendency to treat psychology as a _natural science_.  By\\r\\nthis is not meant, of course, that there is no difference between\\r\\npsychology and the sciences that concern themselves with the world of\\r\\nmaterial things--psychology has to do primarily with minds and not with\\r\\nbodies.  But it is meant that, as the other sciences improve upon the\\r\\nknowledge of the plain man without wholly recasting it, as they accept\\r\\nthe world in which he finds himself and merely attempt to give us a\\r\\nbetter account of it, so the psychologist may accept the world of\\r\\nmatter and of minds recognized by common thought, and may devote\\r\\nhimself to the study of minds, without attempting to solve a class of\\r\\nproblems discussed by the metaphysician.  For example, he may refuse to\\r\\ndiscuss the question whether the mind can really know that there is an\\r\\nexternal world with which it stands in relation, and from which it\\r\\nreceives messages along the avenues of the senses.  He may claim that\\r\\nit is no more his business to treat of this than it is the business of\\r\\nthe mathematician to treat of the ultimate nature of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the psychologist assumes without question the existence of an\\r\\nexternal real world, a world of matter and motion.  He finds in this\\r\\nworld certain organized bodies that present phenomena which he regards\\r\\nas indicative of the presence of minds.  He accepts it as a fact that\\r\\neach mind knows its own states directly, and knows everything else by\\r\\ninference from those states, receiving messages from the outer world\\r\\nalong one set of nerves and reacting along another set.  He conceives\\r\\nof minds as wholly dependent upon messages thus conveyed to them from\\r\\nwithout.  He tells us how a mind, by the aid of such messages,\\r\\ngradually builds up for itself the notion of the external world and of\\r\\nthe other minds which are connected with bodies to be found in that\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may fairly say that all this is merely a development of and an\\r\\nimprovement upon the plain man\\'s knowledge of minds and of bodies.\\r\\nThere is no normal man who does not know that his mind is more\\r\\nintimately related to his body than it is to other bodies.  We all\\r\\ndistinguish between our ideas of things and the external things they\\r\\nrepresent, and we believe that our knowledge of things comes to us\\r\\nthrough the avenues of the senses.  Must we not open our eyes to see,\\r\\nand unstop our ears to hear?  We all know that we do not perceive other\\r\\nminds directly, but must infer their contents from what takes place in\\r\\nthe bodies to which they are referred--from words and actions.\\r\\nMoreover, we know that a knowledge of the outer world and of other\\r\\nminds is built up gradually, and we never think of an infant as knowing\\r\\nwhat a man knows, much as we are inclined to overrate the minds of\\r\\ninfants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the plain man and the psychologist do not greatly differ\\r\\nin their point of view must impress every one who is charged with the\\r\\ntask of introducing students to the study of psychology and philosophy.\\r\\nIt is rather an easy thing to make them follow the reasonings of the\\r\\npsychologist, so long as he avoids metaphysical reflections.  The\\r\\nassumptions which he makes seem to them not unreasonable; and, as for\\r\\nhis methods of investigation, there is no one of them which they have\\r\\nnot already employed themselves in a more or less blundering way.  They\\r\\nhave had recourse to _introspection_, _i.e._ they have noticed the\\r\\nphenomena of their own minds; they have made use of the _objective\\r\\nmethod_, i.e. they have observed the signs of mind exhibited by other\\r\\npersons and by the brutes; they have sometimes _experimented_--this is\\r\\ndone by the schoolgirl who tries to find out how best to tease her\\r\\nroommate, and by the boy who covers and uncovers his ears in church to\\r\\nmake the preacher sing a tune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may not be easy to make men good psychologists, but it is certainly\\r\\nnot difficult to make them understand what the psychologist is doing\\r\\nand to make them realize the value of his work.  He, like the workers\\r\\nin the other natural sciences, takes for granted the world of the plain\\r\\nman, the world of material things in space and time and of minds\\r\\nrelated to those material things.  But when it is a question of\\r\\nintroducing the student to the reflections of the philosophers the case\\r\\nis very different.  We seem to be enticing him into a new and a strange\\r\\nworld, and he is apt to be filled with suspicion and distrust.  The\\r\\nmost familiar things take on an unfamiliar aspect, and questions are\\r\\nraised which it strikes the unreflective man as highly absurd even to\\r\\npropose.  Of this world of reflective thought I shall say just a word\\r\\nin what follows.\\r\\n\\r\\n11. REFLECTIVE THOUGHT.--If we ask our neighbor to meet us somewhere at\\r\\na given hour, he has no difficulty in understanding what we have\\r\\nrequested him to do.  If he wishes to do so, he can be on the spot at\\r\\nthe proper moment.  He may never have asked himself in his whole life\\r\\nwhat he means by space and by time.  He may be quite ignorant that\\r\\nthoughtful men have disputed concerning the nature of these for\\r\\ncenturies past.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd a man may go through the world avoiding disaster year after year by\\r\\ndistinguishing with some success between what is real and what is not\\r\\nreal, and yet he may be quite unable to tell us what, in general, it\\r\\nmeans for a thing to be real.  Some things are real and some are not;\\r\\nas a rule he seems to be able to discover the difference; of his method\\r\\nof procedure he has never tried to give an account to himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat he has a mind he cannot doubt, and he has some idea of the\\r\\ndifference between it and certain other minds; but even the most ardent\\r\\nchampion of the plain man must admit that he has the most hazy of\\r\\nnotions touching the nature of his mind.  He seems to be more doubtful\\r\\nconcerning the nature of the mind and its knowledge than he is\\r\\nconcerning the nature of external things.  Certainly he appears to be\\r\\nmore willing to admit his ignorance in this realm.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet the man can hold his own in the world of real things.  He can\\r\\ndistinguish between this thing and that, this place and that, this time\\r\\nand that.  He can think out a plan and carry it into execution; he can\\r\\nguess at the contents of other minds and allow this knowledge to find\\r\\nits place in his plan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of which proves that our knowledge is not necessarily useless\\r\\nbecause it is rather dim and vague.  It is one thing to use a mental\\r\\nstate; it is another to have a clear comprehension of just what it is\\r\\nand of what elements it may be made up.  The plain man does much of his\\r\\nthinking as we all tie our shoes and button our buttons.  It would be\\r\\ndifficult for us to describe these operations, but we may perform them\\r\\nvery easily nevertheless.  When we say that we _know_ how to tie our\\r\\nshoes, we only mean that we can tie them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, enough has been said in the preceding sections to make clear that\\r\\nthe vagueness which characterizes many notions which constantly recur\\r\\nin common thought is not wholly dispelled by the study of the several\\r\\nsciences.  The man of science, like the plain man, may be able to use\\r\\nvery well for certain purposes concepts which he is not able to analyze\\r\\nsatisfactorily.  For example, he speaks of space and time, cause and\\r\\neffect, substance and qualities, matter and mind, reality and\\r\\nunreality.  He certainly is in a position to add to our knowledge of\\r\\nthe things covered by these terms.  But we should never overlook the\\r\\nfact that the new knowledge which he gives us is a knowledge of the\\r\\nsame kind as that which we had before.  He measures for us spaces and\\r\\ntimes; he does not tell us what space and time are.  He points out the\\r\\ncauses of a multitude of occurrences; he does not tell us what we mean\\r\\nwhenever we use the word \"cause.\"  He informs us what we should accept\\r\\nas real and what we should repudiate as unreal; he does not try to show\\r\\nus what it is to be real and what it is to be unreal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, the man of science _extends_ our knowledge and makes it\\r\\nmore accurate; he does not _analyze_ certain fundamental conceptions,\\r\\nwhich we all use, but of which we can usually give a very poor account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, it is the task of _reflective thought_, not in the\\r\\nfirst instance, to extend the limits of our knowledge of the world of\\r\\nmatter and of minds, but rather _to make us more clearly conscious of\\r\\nwhat that knowledge really is_.  Philosophical reflection takes up and\\r\\ntries to analyze complex thoughts that men use daily without caring to\\r\\nanalyze them, indeed, without even realizing that they may be subjected\\r\\nto analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to be expected that it should impress many of those who are\\r\\nintroduced to it for the first time as rather a fantastic creation of\\r\\nproblems that do not present themselves naturally to the healthy mind.\\r\\nThere is no thoughtful man who does not reflect sometimes and about\\r\\nsome things; but there are few who feel impelled to go over the whole\\r\\nedifice of their knowledge and examine it with a critical eye from its\\r\\nturrets to its foundations.  In a sense, we may say that philosophical\\r\\nthought is not natural, for he who is examining the assumptions upon\\r\\nwhich all our ordinary thought about the world rests is no longer in\\r\\nthe world of the plain man.  He is treating things as men do not\\r\\ncommonly treat them, and it is perhaps natural that it should appear to\\r\\nsome that, in the solvent which he uses, the real world in which we all\\r\\nrejoice should seem to dissolve and disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said that it is not the task of reflective thought, _in the\\r\\nfirst instance_, to extend the limits of our knowledge of the world of\\r\\nmatter and of minds.  This is true.  But this does not mean that, as a\\r\\nresult of a careful reflective analysis, some errors which may creep\\r\\ninto the thought both of the plain man and of the scientist may not be\\r\\nexploded; nor does it mean that some new extensions of our knowledge\\r\\nmay not be suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the chapters to follow I shall take up and examine some of the\\r\\nproblems of reflective thought.  And I shall consider first those\\r\\nproblems that present themselves to those who try to subject to a\\r\\ncareful scrutiny our knowledge of the external world.  It is well to\\r\\nbegin with this, for, even in our common experience, it seems to be\\r\\nrevealed that the knowledge of material things is a something less\\r\\nvague and indefinite than the knowledge of minds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII.  PROBLEMS TOUCHING THE EXTERNAL WORLD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nIS THERE AN EXTERNAL WORLD?\\r\\n\\r\\n12. HOW THE PLAIN MAN THINKS HE KNOWS THE WORLD.--As schoolboys we\\r\\nenjoyed Cicero\\'s joke at the expense of the \"minute philosophers.\"\\r\\nThey denied the immortality of the soul; he affirmed it; and he\\r\\ncongratulated himself upon the fact that, if they were right, they\\r\\nwould not survive to discover it and to triumph over him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the seventeenth century the philosopher John Locke was\\r\\nguilty of a joke of somewhat the same kind.  \"I think,\" said he,\\r\\n\"nobody can, in earnest, be so skeptical as to be uncertain of the\\r\\nexistence of those things which he sees and feels.  At least, he that\\r\\ncan doubt so far (whatever he may have with his own thoughts) will\\r\\nnever have any controversy with me; since he can never be sure I say\\r\\nanything contrary to his own opinion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in this chapter and in certain chapters to follow, I am going to\\r\\ntake up and turn over, so that we may get a good look at them, some of\\r\\nthe problems that have presented themselves to those who have reflected\\r\\nupon the world and the mind as they seem given in our experience.  I\\r\\nshall begin by asking whether it is not possible to doubt that there is\\r\\nan external world at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question cannot best be answered by a jest.  It may, of course, be\\r\\nabsurd to maintain that there is no external world; but surely he, too,\\r\\nis in an absurd position who maintains dogmatically that there is one,\\r\\nand is yet quite unable to find any flaw in the reasonings of the man\\r\\nwho seems to be able to show that this belief has no solid foundation.\\r\\nAnd we must not forget that the men who have thought it worth while to\\r\\nraise just such questions as this, during the last twenty centuries,\\r\\nhave been among the most brilliant intellects of the race.  We must not\\r\\nassume too hastily that they have occupied themselves with mere\\r\\ntrivialities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince, therefore, so many thoughtful men have found it worth while to\\r\\nask themselves seriously whether there is an external world, or, at\\r\\nleast, how we can know that there is an external world, it is not\\r\\nunreasonable to expect that, by looking for it, we may find in our\\r\\ncommon experience or in science some difficulty sufficient to suggest\\r\\nthe doubt which at first strikes the average man as preposterous.  In\\r\\nwhat can such a doubt take its rise?  Let us see.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it is scarcely too much to say that the plain man believes that\\r\\nhe _does not_ directly perceive an external world, and that he, at the\\r\\nsame time, believes that he _does_ directly perceive one.  It is quite\\r\\npossible to believe contradictory things, when one\\'s thought of them is\\r\\nsomewhat vague, and when one does not consciously bring them together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the first-mentioned belief.  Does not the plain man distinguish\\r\\nbetween his ideas of things and the things themselves?  Does he not\\r\\nbelieve that his ideas come to him through the avenues of the senses?\\r\\nIs he not aware of the fact that, when a sense is disordered, the thing\\r\\nas he perceives it is not like the thing \"as it is\"?  A blind man does\\r\\nnot see things when they are there; a color-blind man sees them as\\r\\nothers do not see them; a man suffering under certain abnormal\\r\\nconditions of the nervous system sees things when they are not there at\\r\\nall, _i.e._ he has hallucinations.  The thing itself, as it seems, is\\r\\nnot in the man\\'s mind; it is the idea that is in the man\\'s mind, and\\r\\nthat represents the thing.  Sometimes it appears to give a true account\\r\\nof it; sometimes it seems to give a garbled account; sometimes it is a\\r\\nfalse representative throughout--there is no reality behind it.  It is,\\r\\nthen, the _idea_ that is immediately known, and not the _thing_; the\\r\\nthing is merely _inferred_ to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not mean to say that the plain man is conscious of drawing this\\r\\nconclusion.  I only maintain that it seems a natural conclusion to draw\\r\\nfrom the facts which he recognizes, and that sometimes he seems to draw\\r\\nthe conclusion half-consciously.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, we must all admit that when the plain man is not\\r\\nthinking about the distinction between ideas and things, but is looking\\r\\nat some material object before him, is touching it with his fingers and\\r\\nturning it about to get a good look at it, it never occurs to him that\\r\\nhe is not directly conscious of the thing itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seems to himself to perceive the thing immediately; to perceive it\\r\\n_as_ it is and _where_ it is; to perceive it as a really extended\\r\\nthing, out there in space before his body.  He does not think of\\r\\nhimself as occupied with mere images, representations of the object.\\r\\nHe may be willing to admit that his mind is in his head, but he cannot\\r\\nthink that what he sees is in his head.  Is not the object _there_?\\r\\ndoes he not _see_ and _feel_ it?  Why doubt such evidence as this?  He\\r\\nwho tells him that the external world does not exist seems to be\\r\\ndenying what is immediately given in his experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who looks at things in this way assumes, of course, that the\\r\\nexternal object is known directly, and is not a something merely\\r\\ninferred to exist from the presence of a representative image.  May one\\r\\nembrace this belief and abandon the other one?  If we elect to do this,\\r\\nwe appear to be in difficulties at once.  All the considerations which\\r\\nmade us distinguish so carefully between our ideas of things and the\\r\\nthings themselves crowd in upon us.  Can it be that we know things\\r\\nindependently of the avenues of the senses?  Would a man with different\\r\\nsenses know things just as we do?  How can any man suffer from an\\r\\nhallucination, if things are not inferred from images, but are known\\r\\nindependently?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulties encountered appear sufficiently serious even if we\\r\\nkeep to that knowledge of things which seems to be given in common\\r\\nexperience.  But even the plain man has heard of atoms and molecules;\\r\\nand if he accepts the extension of knowledge offered him by the man of\\r\\nscience, he must admit that, whatever this apparently immediately\\r\\nperceived external thing may be, it cannot be the external thing that\\r\\nscience assures him is out there in space beyond his body, and which\\r\\nmust be a very different sort of thing from the thing he seems to\\r\\nperceive.  The thing he perceives must, then, be _appearance_; and\\r\\nwhere can that appearance be if not in his own mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who has made no study of philosophy at all does not usually\\r\\nthink these things out; but surely there are interrogation marks\\r\\nwritten up all over his experience, and he misses them only because he\\r\\ndoes not see clearly.  By judiciously asking questions one may often\\r\\nlead him either to affirm or to deny that he has an immediate knowledge\\r\\nof the external world, pretty much as one pleases.  If he affirms it,\\r\\nhis position does not seem to be a wholly satisfactory one, as we have\\r\\nseen; and if he denies it, he makes the existence of the external world\\r\\nwholly a matter of inference from the presence of ideas in the mind,\\r\\nand he must stand ready to justify this inference.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many men it has seemed that the inference is not an easy one to\\r\\njustify.  One may say: We could have no ideas of things, no sensations,\\r\\nif real things did not exist and make an impression upon our senses.\\r\\nBut to this it may be answered: How is that statement to be proved?  Is\\r\\nit to be proved by observing that, when things are present and affect\\r\\nthe senses, there come into being ideas which represent the things?\\r\\nEvidently such a proof as this is out of the question, for, if it is\\r\\ntrue that we know external things only by inference and never\\r\\nimmediately, then we can never prove by observation that ideas and\\r\\nthings are thus connected.  And if it is not to be proved by\\r\\nobservation, how shall it be proved?  Shall we just assume it\\r\\ndogmatically and pass on to something else?  Surely there is enough in\\r\\nthe experience of the plain man to justify him in raising the question\\r\\nwhether he can certainly know that there is an external world.\\r\\n\\r\\n13. THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND THE EXTERNAL WORLD.--We have seen just above\\r\\nthat the doubt regarding the existence of the world seems to have its\\r\\nroot in the familiar distinction between ideas and things, appearances\\r\\nand the realities which they are supposed to represent.  The\\r\\npsychologist has much to say about ideas; and if sharpening and making\\r\\nclear this distinction has anything to do with stirring up doubts, it\\r\\nis natural to suppose that they should become more insistent when one\\r\\nhas exchanged the ignorance of everyday life for the knowledge of the\\r\\npsychologist.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when the psychologist asks how a given mind comes to have a\\r\\nknowledge of any external thing, he finds his answer in the messages\\r\\nwhich have been brought to the mind by means of the bodily senses.  He\\r\\ndescribes the sense-organs and the nervous connections between these\\r\\nand the brain, and tells us that when certain nervous impulses have\\r\\ntraveled, let us say, from the eye or the ear to the brain, one has\\r\\nsensations of sight or sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe describes for us in detail how, out of such sensations and the\\r\\nmemories of such sensations, we frame mental images of external things.\\r\\nBetween the mental image and the thing that it represents he\\r\\ndistinguishes sharply, and he informs us that the mind knows no more\\r\\nabout the external thing than is contained in such images.  That a\\r\\nthing is present can be known only by the fact that a message from the\\r\\nthing is sent along the nerves, and what the thing is must be\\r\\ndetermined from the character of the message.  Given the image in the\\r\\nabsence of the thing,--that is to say, an hallucination,--the mind will\\r\\nnaturally suppose that the thing is present.  This false supposition\\r\\ncannot be corrected by a direct inspection of the thing, for such a\\r\\ndirect inspection of things is out of the question.  The only way in\\r\\nwhich the mind concerned can discover that the thing is absent is by\\r\\nreferring to its other experiences.  This image is compared with other\\r\\nimages and is discovered to be in some way abnormal.  We decide that it\\r\\nis a false representative and has no corresponding reality behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doctrine taken as it stands seems to cut the mind off from the\\r\\nexternal world very completely; and the most curious thing about it is\\r\\nthat it seems to be built up on the assumption that it is not really\\r\\ntrue.  How can one know certainly that there is a world of material\\r\\nthings, including human bodies with their sense-organs and nerves, if\\r\\nno mind has ever been able to inspect directly anything of the sort?\\r\\nHow can we tell that a sensation arises when a nervous impulse has been\\r\\ncarried along a sensory nerve and has reached the brain, if every mind\\r\\nis shut up to the charmed circle of its own ideas?  The anatomist and\\r\\nthe physiologist give us very detailed accounts of the sense-organs and\\r\\nof the brain; the physiologist even undertakes to measure the speed\\r\\nwith which the impulse passes along a nerve; the psychologist accepts\\r\\nand uses the results of their labors.  But can all this be done in the\\r\\nabsence of any first-hand knowledge of the things of which one is\\r\\ntalking?  Remember that, if the psychologist is right, any external\\r\\nobject, eye, ear, nerve, or brain, which we can perceive directly, is a\\r\\nmental complex, a something in the mind and not external at all.  How\\r\\nshall we prove that there are objects, ears, eyes, nerves, and\\r\\nbrains,--in short, all the requisite mechanism for the calling into\\r\\nexistence of sensations,--in an outer world which is not immediately\\r\\nperceived but is only inferred to exist?\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not wish to be regarded as impugning the right of the psychologist\\r\\nto make the assumptions which he does, and to work as he does.  He has\\r\\na right to assume, with the plain man, that there is an external world\\r\\nand that we know it.  But a very little reflection must make it\\r\\nmanifest that he seems, at least, to be guilty of an inconsistency, and\\r\\nthat he who wishes to think clearly should strive to see just where the\\r\\ntrouble lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much, at least, is evident: the man who is inclined to doubt whether\\r\\nthere is, after all, any real external world, appears to find in the\\r\\npsychologist\\'s distinction between ideas and things something like an\\r\\nexcuse for his doubt.  To get to the bottom of the matter and to\\r\\ndissipate his doubt one has to go rather deeply into metaphysics.  I\\r\\nmerely wish to show just here that the doubt is not a gratuitous one,\\r\\nbut is really suggested to the thoughtful mind by a reflection upon our\\r\\nexperience of things.  And, as we are all apt to think that the man of\\r\\nscience is less given to busying himself with useless subtleties than\\r\\nis the philosopher, I shall, before closing this chapter, present some\\r\\nparagraphs upon the subject from the pen of a professor of mathematics\\r\\nand mechanics.\\r\\n\\r\\n14. THE \"TELEPHONE EXCHANGE.\"--\"We are accustomed to talk,\" writes\\r\\nProfessor Karl Pearson,[1] \"of the \\'external world,\\' of the \\'reality\\'\\r\\noutside us.  We speak of individual objects having an existence\\r\\nindependent of our own.  The store of past sense-impressions, our\\r\\nthoughts and memories, although most probably they have beside their\\r\\npsychical element a close correspondence with some physical change or\\r\\nimpress in the brain, are yet spoken of as _inside_ ourselves.  On the\\r\\nother hand, although if a sensory nerve be divided anywhere short of\\r\\nthe brain, we lose the corresponding class of sense impression, we yet\\r\\nspeak of many sense-impressions, such as form and texture, as existing\\r\\noutside ourselves.  How close then can we actually get to this supposed\\r\\nworld outside ourselves?  Just as near but no nearer than the brain\\r\\nterminals of the sensory nerves.  We are like the clerk in the central\\r\\ntelephone exchange who cannot get nearer to his customers than his end\\r\\nof the telephone wires.  We are indeed worse off than the clerk, for to\\r\\ncarry out the analogy properly we must suppose him _never to have been\\r\\noutside the telephone exchange, never to have seen a customer or any\\r\\none like a customer--in short, never, except through the telephone\\r\\nwire, to have come in contact with the outside universe_.  Of that\\r\\n\\'real\\' universe outside himself he would be able to form no direct\\r\\nimpression; the real universe for him would be the aggregate of his\\r\\nconstructs from the messages which were caused by the telephone wires\\r\\nin his office.  About those messages and the ideas raised in his mind\\r\\nby them he might reason and draw his inferences; and his conclusions\\r\\nwould be correct--for what?  For the world of telephonic messages, for\\r\\nthe type of messages that go through the telephone.  Something definite\\r\\nand valuable he might know with regard to the spheres of action and of\\r\\nthought of his telephonic subscribers, but outside those spheres he\\r\\ncould have no experience.  Pent up in his office he could never have\\r\\nseen or touched even a telephonic subscriber _in himself_.  Very much\\r\\nin the position of such a telephone clerk is the conscious _ego_ of\\r\\neach one of us seated at the brain terminals of the sensory nerves.\\r\\nNot a step nearer than those terminals can the _ego_ get to the \\'outer\\r\\nworld,\\' and what in and for themselves are the subscribers to its nerve\\r\\nexchange it has no means of ascertaining.  Messages in the form of\\r\\nsense-impressions come flowing in from that \\'outside world,\\' and these\\r\\nwe analyze, classify, store up, and reason about.  But of the nature of\\r\\n\\'things-in-themselves,\\' of what may exist at the other end of our\\r\\nsystem of telephone wires, we know nothing at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But the reader, perhaps, remarks, \\'I not only see an object, but I can\\r\\n_touch_ it.  I can trace the nerve from the tip of my finger to the\\r\\nbrain.  I am not like the telephone clerk, I can follow my network of\\r\\nwires to their terminals and find what is at the other end of them.\\'\\r\\nCan you, reader?  Think for a moment whether your _ego_ has for one\\r\\nmoment got away from his brain exchange.  The sense-impression that you\\r\\ncall touch was just as much as sight felt only at the brain end of a\\r\\nsensory nerve.  What has told you also of the nerve from the tip of\\r\\nyour finger to your brain?  Why, sense-impressions also, messages\\r\\nconveyed along optic or tactile sensory nerves.  In truth, all you have\\r\\nbeen doing is to employ one subscriber to your telephone exchange to\\r\\ntell you about the wire that goes to a second, but you are just as far\\r\\nas ever from tracing out for yourself the telephone wires to the\\r\\nindividual subscriber and ascertaining what his nature is in and for\\r\\nhimself.  The immediate sense-impression is just as far removed from\\r\\nwhat you term the \\'outside world\\' as the store of impresses.  If our\\r\\ntelephone clerk had recorded by aid of a phonograph certain of the\\r\\nmessages from the outside world on past occasions, then if any\\r\\ntelephonic message on its receipt set several phonographs repeating\\r\\npast messages, we have an image analogous to what goes on in the brain.\\r\\nBoth telephone and phonograph are equally removed from what the clerk\\r\\nmight call the \\'real outside world,\\' but they enable him through their\\r\\nsounds to construct a universe; he projects those sounds, which are\\r\\nreally inside his office, outside his office, and speaks of them as the\\r\\nexternal universe.  This outside world is constructed by him from the\\r\\ncontents of the inside sounds, which differ as widely from\\r\\nthings-in-themselves as language, the symbol, must always differ from\\r\\nthe thing it symbolizes.  For our telephone clerk sounds would be the\\r\\nreal world, and yet we can see how conditioned and limited it would be\\r\\nby the range of his particular telephone subscribers and by the\\r\\ncontents of their messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So it is with our brain; the sounds from telephone and phonograph\\r\\ncorrespond to immediate and stored sense-impressions.  These\\r\\nsense-impressions we project as it were outwards and term the real\\r\\nworld outside ourselves.  But the things-in-themselves which the\\r\\nsense-impressions symbolize, the \\'reality,\\' as the metaphysicians wish\\r\\nto call it, at the other end of the nerve, remains unknown and is\\r\\nunknowable.  Reality of the external world lies for science and for us\\r\\nin combinations of form and color and touch--sense-impressions as\\r\\nwidely divergent from the thing \\'at the other end of the nerve\\' as the\\r\\nsound of the telephone from the subscriber at the other end of the\\r\\nwire.  We are cribbed and confined in this world of sense-impressions\\r\\nlike the exchange clerk in his world of sounds, and not a step beyond\\r\\ncan we get.  As his world is conditioned and limited by his particular\\r\\nnetwork of wires, so ours is conditioned by our nervous system, by our\\r\\norgans of sense.  Their peculiarities determine what is the nature of\\r\\nthe outside world which we construct.  It is the similarity in the\\r\\norgans of sense and in the perceptive faculty of all normal human\\r\\nbeings which makes the outside world the same, or _practically_ the\\r\\nsame, for them all.  To return to the old analogy, it is as if two\\r\\ntelephone exchanges had very nearly identical groups of subscribers.\\r\\nIn this case a wire between the two exchanges would soon convince the\\r\\nimprisoned clerks that they had something in common and peculiar to\\r\\nthemselves.  That conviction corresponds in our comparison to the\\r\\nrecognition of other consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggest that this extract be read over carefully, not once but\\r\\nseveral times, and that the reader try to make quite clear to himself\\r\\nthe position of the clerk in the telephone exchange, _i.e._ the\\r\\nposition of the mind in the body, as depicted by Professor Pearson,\\r\\nbefore recourse is had to the criticisms of any one else.  One cannot\\r\\nfind anywhere better material for critical philosophical reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been seen, our author accepts without question, the\\r\\npsychological doctrine that the mind is shut up within the circle of\\r\\nthe messages that are conducted to it along the sensory nerves, and\\r\\nthat it cannot directly perceive anything truly external.  He carries\\r\\nhis doctrine out to the bitter end in the conclusion that, since we\\r\\nhave never had experience of anything beyond sense-impressions, and\\r\\nhave no ground for an inference to anything beyond, we must recognize\\r\\nthat the only external world of which we know anything is an external\\r\\nworld built up out of sense-impressions.  It is, thus, in the mind, and\\r\\nis not external at all; it is only \"projected outwards,\" _thought of_\\r\\nas though it were beyond us.  Shall we leave the inconsistent position\\r\\nof the plain man and of the psychologist and take our refuge in this\\r\\nworld of projected mental constructs?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the reader makes up his mind to do this, I beg him to consider\\r\\nthe following:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) If the only external world of which we have a right to speak at all\\r\\nis a construct in the mind or _ego_, we may certainly affirm that the\\r\\nworld is in the _ego_, but does it sound sensible to say that the _ego_\\r\\nis somewhere in the world?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) If all external things are really inside the mind, and are only\\r\\n\"projected\" outwards, of course our own bodies, sense-organs, nerves,\\r\\nand brains, are really inside and are merely projected outwards.  Now,\\r\\ndo the sense-impressions of which everything is to be constructed \"come\\r\\nflowing in\" along these nerves that are really inside?\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) Can we say, when a nerve lies entirely within the mind or _ego_,\\r\\nthat this same mind or _ego_ is nearer to one end of the nerve than it\\r\\nis to the other?  How shall we picture to ourselves \"the conscious\\r\\n_ego_ of each one of us seated at the brain terminals of the sensory\\r\\nnerves\"?  How can the _ego_ place the whole of itself at the end of a\\r\\nnerve which it has constructed within itself?  And why is it more\\r\\ndifficult for it to get to one end of a nerve like this than it is to\\r\\nget to the other?\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) Why should the thing \"at the other end of the nerve\" remain unknown\\r\\nand unknowable?  Since the nerve is entirely in the mind, is purely a\\r\\nmental construct, can anything whatever be at the end of it without\\r\\nbeing in the mind?  And if the thing in question is not in the mind,\\r\\nhow are we going to prove that it is any nearer to one end of a nerve\\r\\nwhich is inside the mind than it is to the other?  If it may really be\\r\\nsaid to be at the end of the nerve, why may we not know it quite as\\r\\nwell as we do the end of the nerve, or any other mental construct?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be clear to the careful reader of Professor Pearson\\'s\\r\\nparagraphs, that he does not confine himself strictly to the world of\\r\\nmere \"projections,\" to an outer world which is really _inner_.  If he\\r\\ndid this, the distinction between inner and outer would disappear.  Let\\r\\nus consider for a moment the imprisoned clerk.  He is in a telephone\\r\\nexchange, about him are wires and subscribers.  He gets only sounds and\\r\\nmust build up his whole universe of things out of sounds.  Now we are\\r\\nsupposing him to be in a telephone exchange, to be receiving messages,\\r\\nto be building up a world out of these messages.  Do we for a moment\\r\\nthink of him as building up, out of the messages which came along the\\r\\nwires, those identical wires which carried the messages and the\\r\\nsubscribers which sent them?  Never! we distinguish between the\\r\\nexchange, with its wires and subscribers, and the messages received and\\r\\nworked up into a world.  In picturing to ourselves the telephone\\r\\nexchange, we are doing what the plain man and the psychologist do when\\r\\nthey distinguish between mind and body,--they never suppose that the\\r\\nmessages which come through the senses are identical with the senses\\r\\nthrough which they come.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suppose we maintain that there is no such thing as a telephone\\r\\nexchange, with its wires and subscribers, which is not to be found\\r\\nwithin some clerk.  Suppose the real external world is something\\r\\n_inner_ and only \"projected\" without, mistakenly supposed by the\\r\\nunthinking to be without.  Suppose it is nonsense to speak of a wire\\r\\nwhich is not in the mind of a clerk.  May we under such circumstances\\r\\ndescribe any clerk as _in a telephone exchange_? as _receiving\\r\\nmessages_? as _no nearer_ to his subscribers than his end of the wire?\\r\\nMay we say that sense-impressions _come flowing in_ to him?  The whole\\r\\nfigure of the telephone exchange becomes an absurdity when we have once\\r\\nplaced the exchange within the clerk.  Nor can we think of two clerks\\r\\nas connected by a wire, when it is affirmed that every wire must\\r\\n\"really\" be in some clerk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is, that, in the extracts which I have given above and in\\r\\nmany other passages in the same volume, the real external world, the\\r\\nworld which does not exist in the mind but _without_ it, is much\\r\\ndiscredited, and is yet not actually discarded.  The ego is placed at\\r\\nthe brain terminals of the sensory nerves, and it receives messages\\r\\nwhich _flow in_; _i.e._ the clerk is actually placed in an exchange.\\r\\nThat the existence of the exchange is afterward denied in so many words\\r\\ndoes not mean that it has not played and does not continue to play an\\r\\nimportant part in the thought of the author.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to see how a man of science, whose reflections compel\\r\\nhim to deny the existence of the external world that we all seem to\\r\\nperceive and that we somehow recognize as distinct from anything in our\\r\\nminds, is _nevertheless compelled to admit the existence of this world\\r\\nat every turn_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we do admit it, what shall we make of it?  Shall we deny the\\r\\ntruth of what the psychologist has to tell us about a knowledge of\\r\\nthings only through the sensations to which they give rise?  We cannot,\\r\\nsurely, do that.  Shall we affirm that we know the external world\\r\\ndirectly, and at the same time that we do not know it directly, but\\r\\nonly indirectly, and through the images which arise in our minds?  That\\r\\nseems inconsistent.  Certainly there is material for reflection here.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless the more we reflect on that material, the more evident\\r\\ndoes it become that the plain man cannot be wrong in believing in the\\r\\nexternal world which seems revealed in his experiences.  We find that\\r\\nall attempts to discredit it rest upon the implicit assumption of its\\r\\nexistence, and fall to the ground when that existence is honestly\\r\\ndenied.  So our problem changes its form.  We no longer ask: Is there\\r\\nan external world?  but rather: _What_ is the external world, and how\\r\\ndoes it differ from the world of mere ideas?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"The Grammar of Science,\" 2d Ed., London, 1900, pp. 60-63.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nSENSATIONS AND \"THINGS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n15. SENSE AND IMAGINATION.--Every one distinguishes between things\\r\\nperceived and things only imagined.  With open eyes I see the desk\\r\\nbefore me; with eyes closed, I can imagine it.  I lay my hand on it and\\r\\nfeel it; I can, without laying my hand on it, imagine that I feel it.\\r\\nI raise my eyes, and see the pictures on the wall opposite me; I can\\r\\nsit here and call before my mind the image of the door by which the\\r\\nhouse is entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the difference between sense and imagination?  It must be a\\r\\ndifference of which we are all somehow conscious, for we unhesitatingly\\r\\ndistinguish between the things we perceive and the things we merely\\r\\nimagine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to remember at the outset that the two classes of\\r\\nexperiences are not wholly different.  The blue color that I imagine\\r\\nseems blue.  It does not lose this quality because it is only\\r\\nimaginary.  The horse that I imagine seems to have four legs, like a\\r\\nhorse perceived.  As I call it before my mind, it seems as large as the\\r\\nreal horse.  Neither the color, nor the size, nor the distribution of\\r\\nparts, nor any other attribute of the sort appears to be different in\\r\\nthe imaginary object from what it is in the object as given in\\r\\nsensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two experiences are, nevertheless, not the same; and every one\\r\\nknows that they are not the same.  One difference that roughly marks\\r\\nout the two classes of experiences from one another is that, as a rule,\\r\\nour sense-experiences are more vivid than are the images that exist in\\r\\nthe imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say, as a rule, for we cannot always remark this difference.\\r\\nSensations may be very clear and unmistakable, but they may also be\\r\\nvery faint and indefinite.  When a man lays his hand firmly on my\\r\\nshoulder, I may be in little doubt whether I feel a sensation or do\\r\\nnot; but when he touches my back very lightly, I may easily be in\\r\\ndoubt, and may ask myself in perplexity whether I have really been\\r\\ntouched or whether I have merely imagined it.  As a vessel recedes and\\r\\nbecomes a mere speck upon the horizon, I may well wonder, before I feel\\r\\nsure that it is really quite out of sight, whether I still see the dim\\r\\nlittle point, or whether I merely imagine that I see it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, things merely imagined may sometimes be very vivid\\r\\nand insistent.  To some persons, what exists in the imagination is dim\\r\\nand indefinite in the extreme.  Others imagine things vividly, and can\\r\\ndescribe what is present only to the imagination almost as though it\\r\\nwere something seen.  Finally, we know that an image may become so\\r\\nvivid and insistent as to be mistaken for an external thing.  That is\\r\\nto say, there are such things as hallucinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe criterion of vividness will not, therefore, always serve to\\r\\ndistinguish between what is given in the sense and what is only\\r\\nimagined.  And, indeed, it becomes evident, upon reflection, that we do\\r\\nnot actually make it our ultimate test.  We may be quite willing to\\r\\nadmit that faint sensations may come to be confused with what is\\r\\nimagined, with \"ideas,\" but we always regard such a confusion as\\r\\nsomebody\\'s error.  We are not ready to admit that things perceived\\r\\nfaintly are things imagined, or that vivid \"ideas\" are things perceived\\r\\nby sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us come back to the illustrations with which we started.  How do I\\r\\nknow that I perceive the desk before me; and how do I know that,\\r\\nsitting here, I imagine, and do not see, the front door of the house?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy criterion is this: when I have the experience I call \"seeing my\\r\\ndesk,\" the bit of experience which presents itself as my desk is in a\\r\\ncertain setting.  That is to say, the desk seen must be in a certain\\r\\nrelation to my body, and this body, as I know it, also consists of\\r\\nexperiences.  Thus, if I am to know that I see the desk, I must realize\\r\\nthat my eyes are open, that the object is in front of me and not behind\\r\\nme, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desk as seen varies with the relation to the body in certain ways\\r\\nthat we regard as natural and explicable.  When I am near it, the\\r\\nvisual experience is not just what it is when I recede from it.  But\\r\\nhow can I know that I am near the desk or far from it?  What do these\\r\\nexpressions mean?  Their full meaning will become clearer in the next\\r\\nchapter, but here I may say that nearness and remoteness must be\\r\\nmeasured for me in experiences of some sort, or I would never know\\r\\nanything as near to or far from my body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, all our sensory experiences are experiences that fall into a\\r\\ncertain system or order.  It is a system which we all recognize\\r\\nimplicitly, for we all reject as merely imaginary those experiences\\r\\nwhich lack this setting.  If my eyes are shut--I am speaking now of the\\r\\neyes as experienced, as felt or perceived, as given in sensation--I\\r\\nnever say; \"I see my desk,\" no matter how vivid the image of the\\r\\nobject.  Those who believe in \"second sight\" sometimes talk of seeing\\r\\nthings not in this setting, but the very name they give to the supposed\\r\\nexperience indicates that there is something abnormal about it.  No one\\r\\nthinks it remarkable that I see the desk before which I perceive myself\\r\\nto be sitting with open eyes.  Every one would think it strange if I\\r\\ncould see and describe the table in the next room, now shut away from\\r\\nme.  When a man thinks he hears his name pronounced, and, turning his\\r\\nhead, seeks in vain for the speaker, he sets his experience down as a\\r\\nhallucination.  He says, I did not really hear that; I merely imagined\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay one not, with open eyes, have a hallucination of vision, just as\\r\\none may seem to hear one\\'s name pronounced when no one is by?\\r\\nCertainly.  But in each case the experience may be proved to be a\\r\\nhallucination, nevertheless.  It may be recognized that the sensory\\r\\nsetting is incomplete, though it may not, at first, seem so.  Thus the\\r\\nunreal object which seems to be seen may be found to be a thing that\\r\\ncannot be touched.  Or, when one has attained to a relatively complete\\r\\nknowledge of the system of experiences recognized as sensory, one may\\r\\nmake use of roundabout methods of ascertaining that the experience in\\r\\nquestion does not really have the right setting.  Thus, the ghost which\\r\\nis seen by the terrified peasant at midnight, but which cannot be\\r\\nphotographed, we may unhesitatingly set down as something imagined and\\r\\nnot really seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll our sensations are, therefore, experiences which take their place\\r\\nin a certain setting.  This is our ultimate criterion.  We need not\\r\\ntake the word of the philosopher for it.  We need only reflect, and ask\\r\\nourselves how we know that, in a given case, we are seeing or hearing\\r\\nor touching something, and are not merely imagining it.  In every case,\\r\\nwe shall find that we come back to the same test.  In common life, we\\r\\napply the test instinctively, and with little realization of what we\\r\\nare doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we turn to the psychologist, whose business it is to be more\\r\\nexact and scientific, we find that he gives us only a refinement of\\r\\nthis same criterion.  It is important to him to distinguish between\\r\\nwhat is given in sensation and what is furnished by memory or\\r\\nimagination, and he tells us that sensation is the result of a message\\r\\nconducted along a sensory nerve to the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we see emphasized the relation to the body which has been\\r\\nmentioned above.  If we ask the psychologist how he knows that the body\\r\\nhe is talking about is a real body, and not merely an imagined one, he\\r\\nhas to fall back upon the test which is common to us all.  A real hand\\r\\nis one which we see with the eyes open, and which we touch with the\\r\\nother hand.  If our experiences of our own body had not the setting\\r\\nwhich marks all sensory experiences, we could never say: I _perceive_\\r\\nthat my body is near the desk.  When we call our body real, as\\r\\ncontrasted with things imaginary, we recognize that this group of\\r\\nexperiences belongs to the class described; it is given in sensation,\\r\\nand is not merely thought of.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be observed that, in distinguishing between sensations and\\r\\nthings imaginary, we never go beyond the circle of our experiences.  We\\r\\ndo not reach out to a something _beyond_ or _behind_ experiences, and\\r\\nsay: When such a reality is present, we may affirm that we have a\\r\\nsensation, and when it is not, we may call the experience imaginary.\\r\\nIf there were such a reality as this, it would do us little good, for\\r\\nsince it is not supposed to be perceived directly, we should have to\\r\\ndepend upon the sensations to prove the presence of the reality, and\\r\\ncould not turn to the reality and ask it whether we were or were not\\r\\nexperiencing a sensation.  The distinction between sensations and what\\r\\nis imaginary is an _observed_ distinction.  It can be _proved_ that\\r\\nsome experiences are sensory and that some are not.  This means that,\\r\\nin drawing the distinction, we remain within the circle of our\\r\\nexperiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been much unnecessary mystification touching this supposed\\r\\nreality behind experiences.  In the next chapter we shall see in what\\r\\nsenses the word \"reality\" may properly be used, and in what sense it\\r\\nmay not.  There is a danger in using it loosely and vaguely.\\r\\n\\r\\n16. MAY WE CALL \"THINGS\" GROUPS OF SENSATIONS?--Now, the external world\\r\\nseems to the plain man to be directly given in his sense experiences.\\r\\nHe is willing to admit that the table in the next room, of which he is\\r\\nmerely thinking, is known at one remove, so to speak.  But this desk\\r\\nhere before him: is it not known directly?  Not the mental image, the\\r\\nmere representative, but the desk itself, a something that is physical\\r\\nand not mental?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the psychologist, whatever his theory of the relation between the\\r\\nmind and the world, seems to support him, at least, in so far as to\\r\\nmaintain that in sensation the external world is known as directly as\\r\\nit is possible for the external world to be known, and that one can get\\r\\nno more of it than is presented in sensation.  If a sense is lacking,\\r\\nan aspect of the world as given is also lacking; if a sense is\\r\\ndefective, as in the color-blind, the defect is reflected in the world\\r\\nupon which one gazes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch considerations, especially when taken together with what has been\\r\\nsaid at the close of the last section about the futility of looking for\\r\\na reality behind our sensations, may easily suggest rather a startling\\r\\npossibility.  May it not be, if we really are shut up to the circle of\\r\\nour experiences, that the physical things, which we have been\\r\\naccustomed to look upon as non-mental, are nothing more than complexes\\r\\nof sensations?  Granted that there seems to be presented in our\\r\\nexperience a material world as well as a mind, may it not be that this\\r\\nmaterial world is a mental thing of a certain kind--a mental thing\\r\\ncontrasted with other mental things, such as imaginary things?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis question has always been answered in the affirmative by the\\r\\nidealists, who claim that all existence must be regarded as psychical\\r\\nexistence.  Their doctrine we shall consider later (sections 49 and\\r\\n53).  It will be noticed that we seem to be back again with Professor\\r\\nPearson in the last chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this question I make the following answer: In the first place, I\\r\\nremark that even the plain man distinguishes somehow between his\\r\\nsensations and external things.  He thinks that he has reason to\\r\\nbelieve that things do not cease to exist when he no longer has\\r\\nsensations.  Moreover, he believes that things do not always appear to\\r\\nhis senses as they really are.  If we tell him that his sensations\\r\\n_are_ the things, it shocks his common sense.  He answers: Do you mean\\r\\nto tell me that complexes of sensation can be on a shelf or in a\\r\\ndrawer? can be cut with a knife or broken with the hands?  He feels\\r\\nthat there must be some real distinction between sensations and the\\r\\nthings without him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the notions of the plain man on such matters as these are not very\\r\\nclear, and what he says about sensations and things is not always\\r\\nedifying.  But it is clear that he feels strongly that the man who\\r\\nwould identify them is obliterating a distinction to which his\\r\\nexperience testifies unequivocally.  We must not hastily disregard his\\r\\nprotest.  He is sometimes right in his feeling that things are not\\r\\nidentical, even when he cannot prove it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second place, I remark that, in this instance, the plain man is\\r\\nin the right, and can be shown to be in the right.  \"Things\" are not\\r\\ngroups of sensations.  The distinction between them will be explained\\r\\nin the next section.\\r\\n\\r\\n17. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SENSATIONS AND \"THINGS\"--Suppose that I\\r\\nstand in my study and look at the fire in the grate.  I am experiencing\\r\\nsensations, and am not busied merely with an imaginary fire.  But may\\r\\nmy whole experience of the fire be summed up as an experience of\\r\\nsensations and their changes?  Let us see.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I shut my eyes, the fire disappears.  Does any one suppose that the\\r\\nfire has been annihilated?  No.  We say, I no longer see it, but\\r\\nnothing has happened to the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I may keep my eyes open, and simply turn my head.  The fire\\r\\ndisappears once more.  Does any one suppose that my turning my head has\\r\\ndone anything to the fire?  We say unhesitatingly, my sensations have\\r\\nchanged, but the fire has remained as it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, again, I may withdraw from the fire.  Its heat seems to be\\r\\ndiminished.  Has the fire really grown less hot?  And if I could\\r\\nwithdraw to a sufficient distance, I know that the fire would appear to\\r\\nme smaller and less bright.  Could I get far enough away to make it\\r\\nseem the faintest speck in the field of vision, would I be tempted to\\r\\nclaim that the fire shrunk and grew faint merely because I walked away\\r\\nfrom it?  Surely not.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, suppose that I stand on the same spot and look at the fire without\\r\\nturning my head.  The stick at which I am gazing catches the flame,\\r\\nblazes up, turns red, and finally falls together, a little mass of gray\\r\\nashes.  Shall I describe this by saying that my sensations have\\r\\nchanged, or may I say that the fire itself has changed?  The plain man\\r\\nand the philosopher alike use the latter expression in such a case as\\r\\nthis.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us take another illustration.  I walk towards the distant house on\\r\\nthe plain before me.  What I see as my goal seems to grow larger and\\r\\nbrighter.  It does not occur to me to maintain that the house changes\\r\\nas I advance.  But, at a given instant, changes of a different sort\\r\\nmake their appearance.  Smoke arises, and flames burst from the roof.\\r\\nNow I have no hesitation in saying that changes are taking place in the\\r\\nhouse.  It would seem foolish to describe the occurrence as a mere\\r\\nchange in my sensations.  Before it was my sensations that changed; now\\r\\nit is the house itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are drawing this distinction between changes in our sensations and\\r\\nchanges in things at every hour in the day.  I cannot move without\\r\\nmaking things appear and disappear.  If I wag my head, the furniture\\r\\nseems to dance, and I regard it as a mere seeming.  I count on the\\r\\nclock\\'s going when I no longer look upon its face.  It would be absurd\\r\\nto hold that the distinction is a mere blunder, and has no foundation\\r\\nin our experience.  The r\\xc3\\xb4le it plays is too important for that.  If we\\r\\nobliterate it, the real world of material things which seems to be\\r\\nrevealed in our experience melts into a chaos of fantastic experiences\\r\\nwhose appearances and disappearances seem to be subject to no law.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it is worthy of remark that it is not merely in common life that\\r\\nthe distinction is drawn.  Every man of science must give heed to it.\\r\\nThe psychologist does, it is true, pay much attention to sensations;\\r\\nbut even he distinguishes between the sensations which he is studying\\r\\nand the material things to which he relates them, such as brains and\\r\\nsense-organs.  And those who cultivate the physical sciences strive,\\r\\nwhen they give an account of things and their behavior, to lay before\\r\\nus a history of changes analogous to the burning of the stick and of\\r\\nthe house, excluding mere changes in sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no physicist or botanist or zo\\xc3\\xb6logist who has not our common\\r\\nexperience that things as perceived by us--our experiences of\\r\\nthings--appear or disappear or change their character when we open or\\r\\nshut our eyes or move about.  But nothing of all this appears in their\\r\\nbooks.  What they are concerned with is things and their changes, and\\r\\nthey do not consider such matters as these as falling within their\\r\\nprovince.  If a botanist could not distinguish between the changes\\r\\nwhich take place in a plant, and the changes which take place in his\\r\\nsensations as he is occupied in studying the plant, but should tell us\\r\\nthat the plant grows smaller as one recedes from it, we should set him\\r\\ndown as weak-minded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the distinction is everywhere drawn, and that we must not\\r\\nobliterate it, is very evident.  But we are in the presence of what has\\r\\nseemed to many men a grave difficulty.  Are not things presented in our\\r\\nexperience only as we have sensations?  what is it to perceive a thing?\\r\\nis it not to have sensations? how, then, _can_ we distinguish between\\r\\nsensations and things?  We certainly do so all the time, in spite of\\r\\nthe protest of the philosopher; but many of us do so with a haunting\\r\\nsense that our behavior can scarcely be justified by the reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur difficulty, however, springs out of an error of our own.  Grasping\\r\\nimperfectly the full significance of the word \"sensation,\" we extend\\r\\nits use beyond what is legitimate, and we call by that name experiences\\r\\nwhich are not sensations at all.  Thus the external world comes to seem\\r\\nto us to be not really a something contrasted with the mental, but a\\r\\npart of the mental world.  We accord to it the attributes of the\\r\\nlatter, and rob it of those distinguishing attributes which belong to\\r\\nit by right.  When we have done this, we may feel impelled to say, as\\r\\ndid Professor Pearson, that things are not really \"outside\" of us, as\\r\\nthey seem to be, but are merely \"projected\" outside--thought of as if\\r\\nthey were \"outside.\"  All this I must explain at length.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us come back to the first of the illustrations given above, the\\r\\ncase of the fire in my study.  As I stand and look at it, what shall I\\r\\ncall the red glow which I observe?  Shall I call it a _quality of a\\r\\nthing_, or shall I call it a _sensation_?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this I answer: _I may call it either the one or the other, according\\r\\nto its setting among other experiences_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen (section 15) that sensations and things merely imaginary\\r\\nare distinguished from one another by their setting.  With open eyes we\\r\\nsee things; with our eyes closed we can imagine them: we see what is\\r\\nbefore us; we imagine what lies behind our backs.  If we confine our\\r\\nattention to the bit of experience itself, we have no means of\\r\\ndetermining whether it is sensory or imaginary.  Only its setting can\\r\\ndecide that point.  Here, we have come to another distinction of much\\r\\nthe same sort.  That red glow, that bit of experience, taken by itself\\r\\nand abstracted from all other experiences, cannot be called either a\\r\\nsensation or the quality of a thing.  Only its context can give us the\\r\\nright to call it the one or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ought to become clear when we reflect upon the illustration of the\\r\\nfire.  We have seen that one whole series of changes has been\\r\\nunhesitatingly described as a series of changes in my sensations.  Why\\r\\nwas this?  Because it was observed to depend upon changes in the\\r\\nrelations of my body, my senses (a certain group of experiences), to\\r\\nthe bit of experience I call the fire.  Another series was described as\\r\\na series of changes in the fire.  Why?  Because, the relation to my\\r\\nsenses remaining unchanged, changes still took place, and had to be\\r\\naccounted for in other ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that they can be accounted for in\\r\\nother ways.  This is not a discovery of the philosopher.  He can only\\r\\ninvite us to think over the matter and see what the unlearned and the\\r\\nlearned are doing at every moment.  Sometimes they are noticing that\\r\\nexperiences change as they turn their heads or walk toward or away from\\r\\nobjects; sometimes they abstract from this, and consider the series of\\r\\nchanges that take place independently of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat bit of experience, that red glow, is not related only to my body.\\r\\nSuch experiences are related also to each other; they stand in a vast\\r\\nindependent system of relations, which, as we have seen, the man of\\r\\nscience can study without troubling himself to consider sensations at\\r\\nall.  This system is the external world--the external world as known or\\r\\nas knowable, the only external world that it means anything for us to\\r\\ntalk about.  As having its place in this system, a bit of experience is\\r\\nnot a sensation, but is a quality or aspect of a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSensations, then, to be sensations, must be bits of experience\\r\\nconsidered in their relation to some organ of sense.  They should never\\r\\nbe confused with qualities of things, which are experiences in a\\r\\ndifferent setting.  It is as unpardonable to confound the two as it is\\r\\nto confound sensations with things imaginary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may not, therefore, say that \"things\" are groups of sensations.  We\\r\\nmay, if we please, describe them as complexes of qualities.  And we may\\r\\nnot say that the \"things\" we perceive are really \"inside\" of us and are\\r\\nmerely \"projected outside.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can \"inside\" and \"outside\" mean?  Only this.  We recognize in our\\r\\nexperience two distinct orders, the _objective order_, the system of\\r\\nphenomena which constitutes the material world, and the _subjective\\r\\norder_, the order of things mental, to which belong sensations and\\r\\n\"ideas.\"  That is \"outside\" which belongs to the objective order.  The\\r\\nword has no other meaning when used in this connection.  That is\\r\\n\"inside\" which belongs to the subjective order, and is contrasted with\\r\\nthe former.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we deny that there is an objective order, an external world, and say\\r\\nthat everything is \"inside,\" we lose our distinction, and even the word\\r\\n\"inside\" becomes meaningless.  It indicates no contrast.  When men fall\\r\\ninto the error of talking in this way, what they do is to _keep_ the\\r\\nexternal world and gain the distinction, and at the same time to _deny_\\r\\nthe existence of the world which has furnished it.  In other words,\\r\\nthey put the clerk into a telephone exchange, and then tell us that the\\r\\nexchange does not really exist.  He is inside--of what?  He is inside\\r\\nof nothing.  Then, can he really be inside?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see, thus, that the plain man and the man of science are quite right\\r\\nin accepting the external world.  The objective order is known as\\r\\ndirectly as is the subjective order.  Both are orders of experiences;\\r\\nthey are open to observation, and we have, in general, little\\r\\ndifficulty in distinguishing between them, as the illustrations given\\r\\nabove amply prove.\\r\\n\\r\\n18. THE EXISTENCE OF MATERIAL THINGS.--One difficulty seems to remain\\r\\nand to call for a solution.  We all believe that material things exist\\r\\nwhen we no longer perceive them.  We believe that they existed before\\r\\nthey came within the field of our observation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these positions the man of science supports us.  The astronomer has\\r\\nno hesitation in saying that the comet, which has sailed away through\\r\\nspace, exists, and will return.  The geologist describes for us the\\r\\nworld as it was in past ages, when no eye was opened upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut has it not been stated above that the material world is an order of\\r\\n_experiences_? and can there be such a thing as an experience that is\\r\\nnot _experienced_ by somebody?  In other words, can the world exist,\\r\\nexcept as it is _perceived to exist_?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seeming difficulty has occasioned much trouble to philosophers in\\r\\nthe past.  Bishop Berkeley (1684-1753) said, \"To exist is to be\\r\\nperceived.\"  There are those who agree with him at the present day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir difficulty would have disappeared had they examined with\\r\\nsufficient care the meaning of the word \"exist.\"  We have no right to\\r\\npass over the actual uses of such words, and to give them a meaning of\\r\\nour own.  If one thing seems as certain as any other, it is that\\r\\nmaterial things exist when we do not perceive them.  On what ground may\\r\\nthe philosopher combat the universal opinion, the dictum of common\\r\\nsense and of science?  When we look into his reasonings, we find that\\r\\nhe is influenced by the error discussed at length in the last\\r\\nsection--he has confused the phenomena of the two orders of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said that, when we concern ourselves with the objective order,\\r\\nwe abstract or should abstract, from the relations which things bear to\\r\\nour senses.  We account for phenomena by referring to other phenomena\\r\\nwhich we have reason to accept as their physical conditions or causes.\\r\\nWe do not consider that a physical cause is effective only while we\\r\\nperceive it.  When we come back to this notion of our perceiving a\\r\\nthing or not perceiving it, we have left the objective order and passed\\r\\nover to the subjective.  We have left the consideration of \"things\" and\\r\\nhave turned to sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no reason why we should do this.  The physical order is an\\r\\nindependent order, as we have seen.  The man of science, when he is\\r\\nendeavoring to discover whether some thing or quality of a thing really\\r\\nexisted at some time in the past, is not in the least concerned to\\r\\nestablish the fact that some one saw it.  No one ever saw the primitive\\r\\nfire-mist from which, as we are told, the world came into being.  But\\r\\nthe scientist cares little for that.  He is concerned only to prove\\r\\nthat the phenomena he is investigating really have a place in the\\r\\nobjective order.  If he decides that they have, he is satisfied; he has\\r\\nproved something to exist.  _To belong to the objective order is to\\r\\nexist as a physical thing or quality_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the plain man and the man of science maintain that a physical\\r\\nthing exists, they use the word in precisely the same sense.  The\\r\\nmeaning they give to it is the proper meaning of the word.  It is\\r\\njustified by immemorial usage, and it marks a real distinction.  Shall\\r\\nwe allow the philosopher to tell us that we must not use it in this\\r\\nsense, but must say that only sensations and ideas exist?  Surely not.\\r\\nThis would mean that we permit him to obliterate for us the distinction\\r\\nbetween the external world and what is mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is it right to use the word \"experience\" to indicate the phenomena\\r\\nwhich have a place in the objective order?  Can an experience be\\r\\nanything but mental?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that the suggestions of the word are\\r\\nunfortunate--it has what we may call a subjective flavor.  It suggests\\r\\nthat, after all, the things we perceive are sensations or percepts, and\\r\\nmust, to exist at all, exist in a mind.  As we have seen, this is an\\r\\nerror, and an error which we all avoid in actual practice.  We do not\\r\\ntake sensations for things, and we recognize clearly enough that it is\\r\\none thing for a material object to exist and another for it to be\\r\\nperceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, then, use the word \"experience\"?  Simply because we have no better\\r\\nword.  We must use it, and not be misled by the associations which\\r\\ncling to it.  The word has this great advantage: it brings out clearly\\r\\nthe fact that all our knowledge of the external world rests ultimately\\r\\nupon those phenomena which, when we consider them in relation to our\\r\\nsenses, we recognize as sensations.  We cannot start out from mere\\r\\nimaginings to discover what the world was like in the ages past.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is this truth that is recognized by the plain man, when he maintains\\r\\nthat, in the last resort, we can know things only in so far as we see,\\r\\ntouch, hear, taste, and smell them; and by the psychologist, when he\\r\\ntells us that, in sensation, the external world is revealed as directly\\r\\nas it is possible that it could be revealed.  But it is a travesty on\\r\\nthis truth to say that we do not know things, but know only our\\r\\nsensations of sight, touch, taste, hearing, and the like.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] See the note on this chapter at the close of the volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nAPPEARANCES AND REALITIES\\r\\n\\r\\n19. THINGS AND THEIR APPEARANCES.--We have seen in the last chapter\\r\\nthat there is an external world and that it is given in our experience.\\r\\nThere is an objective order, and we are all capable of distinguishing\\r\\nbetween it and the subjective.  He who says that we perceive only\\r\\nsensations and ideas flies in the face of the common experience of\\r\\nmankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are not yet through with the subject.  We all make a distinction\\r\\nbetween things as they _appear_ and things as they _really are_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we ask the plain man, What is the real external world? the first\\r\\nanswer that seems to present itself to his mind is this: Whatever we\\r\\ncan see, hear, touch, taste, or smell may be regarded as belonging to\\r\\nthe real world.  What we merely imagine does not belong to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat this answer is not a very satisfactory one occurred to men\\'s minds\\r\\nvery early in the history of reflective thought.  The ancient skeptic\\r\\nsaid to himself: The colors of objects vary according to the light, and\\r\\naccording to the position and distance of the objects; can we say that\\r\\nany object has a real color of its own?  A staff stuck into water looks\\r\\nbent, but feels straight to the touch; why believe the testimony of one\\r\\nsense rather than that of another?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch questionings led to far-reaching consequences.  They resulted in a\\r\\nforlorn distrust of the testimony of the senses, and to  a doubt as to\\r\\nour ability to know anything as it really is.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the distinction between appearances and realities exists for us as\\r\\nwell as for the ancient skeptic, and without being tempted to make such\\r\\nextravagant statements as that there is no such thing as truth, and\\r\\nthat every appearance is as real as any other, we may admit that it is\\r\\nnot very easy to see the full significance of the distinction, although\\r\\nwe are referring to it constantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, we look from our window and see, as we say, a tree at a\\r\\ndistance.  What we are conscious of is a small bluish patch of color.\\r\\nNow, a small bluish patch of color is not, strictly speaking, a tree;\\r\\nbut for us it represents the tree.  Suppose that we walk toward the\\r\\ntree.  Do we continue to see what we saw before?  Of course, we say\\r\\nthat we continue to see the same tree; but it is plain that what we\\r\\nimmediately perceive, what is given in consciousness, does not remain\\r\\nthe same as we move.  Our blue patch of color grows larger and larger;\\r\\nit ceases to be blue and faint; at the last it has been replaced by an\\r\\nexpanse of vivid green, and we see the tree just before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our whole walk we have been seeing the tree.  This appears to\\r\\nmean that we have been having a whole series of visual experiences, no\\r\\ntwo of which were just alike, and each of which was taken as a\\r\\nrepresentative of the tree.  Which of these representatives is most\\r\\nlike the tree?  Is the tree _really_ a faint blue, or is it _really_ a\\r\\nvivid green?  Or is it of some intermediate color?\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably most persons will be inclined to maintain that the tree only\\r\\nseems blue at a distance, but that it really is green, as it appears\\r\\nwhen one is close to it.  In a sense, the statement is just; yet some\\r\\nof those who make it would be puzzled to tell by what right they pick\\r\\nout of the whole series of experiences, each of which represents the\\r\\ntree as seen from some particular position, one individual experience,\\r\\nwhich they claim not only represents the tree as seen from a given\\r\\npoint but also represents it as it is.  Does this particular experience\\r\\nbear some peculiar earmark which tells us that it is like the real tree\\r\\nwhile the others are unlike it?\\r\\n\\r\\n20. REAL THINGS.--And what is this _real tree_ that we are supposed to\\r\\nsee as it is when we are close to it?\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two hundred years ago the philosopher Berkeley pointed out that\\r\\nthe distinction commonly made between things as they look, the\\r\\napparent, and things as they are, the real, is at bottom the\\r\\ndistinction between things as presented to the sense of sight and\\r\\nthings as presented to the sense of touch.  The acute analysis which he\\r\\nmade has held its own ever since.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that, in walking towards the tree, we have a long series\\r\\nof visual experiences, each of which differs more or less from all of\\r\\nthe others.  Nevertheless, from the beginning of our progress to the\\r\\nend, we say that we are looking at the same tree.  The images change\\r\\ncolor and grow larger.  We do not say that the tree changes color and\\r\\ngrows larger.  Why do we speak as we do?  It is because, all along the\\r\\nline, we mean by the real tree, not what is given to the sense of\\r\\nsight, but something for which this stands as a sign.  This something\\r\\nmust be given in our experience somewhere, we must be able to perceive\\r\\nit under some circumstances or other, or it would never occur to us to\\r\\nrecognize the visual experiences as _signs_, and we should never say\\r\\nthat in being conscious of them in succession we are looking at the\\r\\nsame tree.  They are certainly not the same with each other; how can we\\r\\nknow that they all stand for the same thing, unless we have had\\r\\nexperience of a connection of the whole series with one thing?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thing for which so many different visual experiences may serve as\\r\\nsigns is the thing revealed in experiences of touch.  When we ask: In\\r\\nwhat direction is the tree?  How far away is the tree?  How big is the\\r\\ntree? we are always referring to the tree revealed in touch.  It is\\r\\nnonsense to say that _what we see_ is far away, if by what we see we\\r\\nmean the visual experience itself.  As soon as we move we lose that\\r\\nvisual experience and get another, and to recover the one we lost we\\r\\nmust go back where we were before.  When we say we see a tree at a\\r\\ndistance, we must mean, then, that we know from certain visual\\r\\nexperiences which we have that by moving a certain distance we will be\\r\\nable to touch a tree.  And what does it mean to move a certain\\r\\ndistance?  In the last analysis it means to us to have a certain\\r\\nquantity of movement sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the real world of things, for which experiences of sight serve as\\r\\nsigns, is a world revealed in experiences of touch and movement, and\\r\\nwhen we speak of real positions, distances, and magnitudes, we are\\r\\nalways referring to this world.  But this is a world revealed in our\\r\\nexperience, and it does not seem a hopeless task to discover what may\\r\\nproperly be called real and what should be described as merely\\r\\napparent, when both the real and the apparent are open to our\\r\\ninspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan we not find in this analysis a satisfactory explanation of the\\r\\nplain man\\'s claim that under certain circumstances he sees the tree as\\r\\nit is and under others he does not?  What he is really asserting is\\r\\nthat one visual experience gives him better information regarding the\\r\\nreal thing, the touch thing, than does another.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what shall we say of his claim that the tree is really green, and\\r\\nonly looks blue under certain circumstances?  Is it not just as true\\r\\nthat the tree only looks green under certain circumstances?  Is color\\r\\nany part of the touch thing?  Is it ever more than a sign of the touch\\r\\nthing?  How can one color be more real than another?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we may hold to Berkeley\\'s analysis and maintain that, in general,\\r\\nthe real world, as contrasted with the apparent, means to us the world\\r\\nthat is revealed in experiences of touch and movement; and yet we may\\r\\nadmit that the word \"real\" is sometimes used in rather different senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not seem absurd for a woman to Say: This piece of silk really\\r\\nis yellow; it only looks white under this light.  We all admit that a\\r\\nwhite house may look pink under the rays of the setting sun, and we\\r\\nnever call it a pink house.  We have seen that it is not unnatural to\\r\\nsay: That tree is really green; it is only its distance that makes it\\r\\nlook blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one reflects upon these uses of the word \"real,\" one recognizes\\r\\nthe fact that, among all the experiences in which things are revealed\\r\\nto us, certain experiences impress us as being more prominent or\\r\\nimportant or serviceable than certain others, and they come to be\\r\\ncalled _real_.  Things are not commonly seen by artificial light; the\\r\\nsun is not always setting; the tree looks green when it is seen most\\r\\nsatisfactorily.  In each case, the real color of the thing is the color\\r\\nthat it has under circumstances that strike us as normal or as\\r\\nimportant.  We cannot say that we always regard as most real that\\r\\naspect under which we most commonly perceive things, for if a more\\r\\nunusual experience is more serviceable and really gives us more\\r\\ninformation about the thing, we give the preference to that.  Thus we\\r\\nlook with the naked eye at a moving speck on the table before us, and\\r\\nwe are unable to distinguish its parts.  We place a microscope over the\\r\\nspeck and perceive an insect with all its members.  The second\\r\\nexperience is the more unusual one, but would not every one say: Now we\\r\\nperceive the thing _as it is_?\\r\\n\\r\\n21. ULTIMATE REAL THINGS.--Let us turn away from the senses of the word\\r\\n\"real,\" which recognize one color or taste or odor as more real than\\r\\nanother, and come back to the real world of things presented in\\r\\nsensations of touch.  All other classes of sensations may be regarded\\r\\nas related to this as the series of visual experiences above mentioned\\r\\nwas related to the one tree which was spoken of as revealed in them\\r\\nall, the touch tree of which they gave information.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan we say that this world is always to be regarded as reality and\\r\\nnever as appearance?  We have already seen (section 8) that science\\r\\ndoes not regard as anything more than appearance the real things which\\r\\nseem to be directly presented in our experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pen that I hold in my hand seems, as I pass my fingers over it, to\\r\\nbe continuously extended.  It does not appear to present an alternation\\r\\nof filled spaces and empty spaces.  I am told that it is composed of\\r\\nmolecules in rapid motion and at considerable distances from one\\r\\nanother.  I am further told that each molecule is composed of atoms,\\r\\nand is, in its turn, not a continuous thing, but, so to speak, a group\\r\\nof little things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I accept this doctrine, as it seems I must, am I not forced to\\r\\nconclude that the reality which is given in my experience, the reality\\r\\nwith which I have contrasted appearances and to which I have referred\\r\\nthem, is, after all, itself only an appearance?  The touch things which\\r\\nI have hitherto regarded as the real things that make up the external\\r\\nworld, the touch things for which all my visual experiences have served\\r\\nas signs, are, then, not themselves real external things, but only the\\r\\nappearances under which real external things, themselves imperceptible,\\r\\nmanifest themselves to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems, then, that I do not directly perceive any real thing, or, at\\r\\nleast, anything that can be regarded as more than an appearance.  What,\\r\\nthen, is the external world?  What are things really like?  Can we give\\r\\nany true account of them, or are we forced to say with the skeptics\\r\\nthat we only know how things seem to us, and must abandon the attempt\\r\\nto tell what they are really like?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, before one sets out to answer a question it is well to find out\\r\\nwhether it is a sensible question to ask and a sensible question to try\\r\\nto answer.  He who asks: Where is the middle of an infinite line?  When\\r\\ndid all time begin?  Where is space as a whole? does not deserve a\\r\\nserious answer to his questions.  And it is well to remember that he\\r\\nwho asks: What is the external world like? must keep his question a\\r\\nsignificant one, if he is to retain his right to look for an answer at\\r\\nall.  He has manifestly no right to ask us: How does the external world\\r\\nlook when no one is looking?  How do things feel when no one feels\\r\\nthem?  How shall I think of things, not as I think of them, but as they\\r\\nare?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we are to give an account of the external world at all, it must\\r\\nevidently be _an account_ of the external world; _i.e._ it must be\\r\\ngiven in terms of our experience of things.  The only legitimate\\r\\nproblem is to give a true account instead of a false one, to\\r\\ndistinguish between what only appears and is not real and what both\\r\\nappears and is real.\\r\\n\\r\\nBearing this in mind, let us come back to the plain man\\'s experience of\\r\\nthe world.  He certainly seems to himself to perceive a real world of\\r\\nthings, and he constantly distinguishes, in a way very serviceable to\\r\\nhimself, between the merely apparent and the real.  There is, of\\r\\ncourse, a sense in which every experience is real; it is, at least, an\\r\\nexperience; but when he contrasts real and apparent he means something\\r\\nmore than this.  Experiences are not relegated to this class or to that\\r\\nmerely at random, but the final decision is the outcome of a long\\r\\nexperience of the differences which characterize different individual\\r\\nexperiences and is an expression of the relations which are observed to\\r\\nhold between them.  Certain experiences are accepted as signs, and\\r\\ncertain others come to take the more dignified position of thing\\r\\nsignified; the mind rests in them and regards them as the real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen above that the world of real things in which the plain man\\r\\nfinds himself is a world of objects revealed in experiences of touch.\\r\\nWhen he asks regarding anything: How far away is it?  How big is it?\\r\\nIn what direction is it? it is always the touch thing that interests\\r\\nhim.  What is given to the other senses is only a sign of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also seen (section 8) that the world of atoms and molecules of\\r\\nwhich the man of science tells us is nothing more than a further\\r\\ndevelopment of the world of the plain man.  The real things with which\\r\\nscience concerns itself are, after all, only minute touch things,\\r\\nconceived just as are the things with which the plain man is familiar.\\r\\nThey exist in space and move about in space, as the things about us are\\r\\nperceived to exist in space and move about in space.  They have size\\r\\nand position, and are separated by distances.  We do not _perceive_\\r\\nthem, it is true; but we _conceive_ them after the analogy of the\\r\\nthings that we do perceive, and it is not inconceivable that, if our\\r\\nsenses were vastly more acute, we might perceive them directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when we conclude that the things directly perceptible to the sense\\r\\nof touch are to be regarded as appearances, as signs of the presence of\\r\\nthese minuter things, do we draw such a conclusion arbitrarily?  By no\\r\\nmeans.  The distinction between appearance and reality is drawn here\\r\\njust as it is drawn in the world of our common everyday experiences.\\r\\nThe great majority of the touch things about us we are not actually\\r\\ntouching at any given moment.  We only _see_ the things, _i.e._ we have\\r\\ncertain _signs_ of their presence.  None the less we believe that the\\r\\nthings exist all the time.  And in the same way the man of science does\\r\\nnot doubt the existence of the real things of which he speaks; he\\r\\nperceives their _signs_.  That certain experiences are to be taken as\\r\\nsigns of such realities he has established by innumerable observations\\r\\nand careful deductions from those observations.  To see the full force\\r\\nof his reasonings one must read some work setting forth the history of\\r\\nthe atomic theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, we ask the question: What is the real external world?  it is\\r\\nclear that we cannot answer it satisfactorily without taking into\\r\\nconsideration the somewhat shifting senses of the word \"real.\"  What is\\r\\nthe real external world to the plain man?  It is the world of touch\\r\\nthings, of objects upon which he can lay his hands.  What is the real\\r\\nexternal world to the man of science?  It is the world of atoms and\\r\\nmolecules, of minuter touch things that he cannot actually touch, but\\r\\nwhich he conceives as though he could touch them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be observed that the man of science has no right to deny the\\r\\nreal world which is revealed in the experience of the plain man.  In\\r\\nall his dealings with the things which interest him in common life, he\\r\\nrefers to this world just as the plain man does.  He sees a tree and\\r\\nwalks towards it, and distinguishes between its real and its apparent\\r\\ncolor, its real and its apparent size.  He talks about seeing things as\\r\\nthey are, or not seeing things as they are.  These distinctions in his\\r\\nexperience of things remain even after he has come to believe in atoms\\r\\nand molecules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the touch object, the tree as he feels it under his hand, may\\r\\ncome to be regarded as the sign of the presence of those entities that\\r\\nscience seems, at present, to regard as ultimate.  Does this prevent it\\r\\nfrom being the object which has stood as the interpreter of all those\\r\\ndiverse visual sensations that we have called different views of the\\r\\ntree?  They are still the appearances, and it, relatively to them, is\\r\\nthe reality.  Now we find that it, in its turn, can be used as a sign\\r\\nof something else, can be regarded as an appearance of a reality more\\r\\nultimate.  It is clear, then, that the same thing may be regarded both\\r\\nas appearance and as reality--appearance as contrasted with one thing,\\r\\nand reality as contrasted with another.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suppose one says: _I do not want to know what the real external\\r\\nworld is to this man or to that man; I want to know what the real\\r\\nexternal world is_.  What shall we say to such a demand?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a sense in which such a demand is not purely meaningless,\\r\\nthough it may not be a very sensible demand to make.  We have seen that\\r\\nan increase of knowledge about things compels a man to pass from the\\r\\nreal things of common life to the real things of science, and to look\\r\\nupon the former as appearance.  Now, a man may arbitrarily decide that\\r\\nhe will use the word \"reality\" to indicate only that which can never in\\r\\nits turn be regarded as appearance, a reality which must remain an\\r\\nultimate reality; and he may insist upon our telling him about that.\\r\\nHow a man not a soothsayer can tell when he has come to ultimate\\r\\nreality, it is not easy to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose, however, that we could give any one such information.  We\\r\\nshould then be telling him about things _as they are_, it is true, but\\r\\nhis knowledge of things would not be different in _kind_ from what it\\r\\nwas before.  The only difference between such a knowledge of things and\\r\\na knowledge of things not known to be ultimate would be that, in the\\r\\nformer case, it would be recognized that no further extension of\\r\\nknowledge was possible.  The distinction between appearance and reality\\r\\nwould remain just what it was in the experience of the plain man.\\r\\n\\r\\n22. THE BUGBEAR OF THE \"UNKNOWABLE.\"--It is very important to recognize\\r\\nthat we must not go on talking about appearance and reality, as if our\\r\\nwords really meant something, when we have quite turned our backs upon\\r\\nour experience of appearances and the realities which they represent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat appearances and realities are connected we know very well, for we\\r\\nperceive them to be connected.  What we see, we can touch.  And we not\\r\\nonly know that appearances and realities are connected, but we know\\r\\nwith much detail what appearances are to be taken as signs of what\\r\\nrealities.  The visual experience which I call the house as seen from a\\r\\ndistance I never think of taking for a representative of the hat which\\r\\nI hold in my hand.  This visual experience I refer to its own\\r\\nappropriate touch thing, and not to another.  If what _looks like_ a\\r\\nbeefsteak could _really be_ a fork or a mountain or a kitten\\r\\nindifferently,--but I must not even finish the sentence, for the words\\r\\n\"look like\" and \"could really be\" lose all significance when we loosen\\r\\nthe bond between appearances and the realities to which they are\\r\\nproperly referred.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach appearance, then, must be referred to some particular real thing\\r\\nand not to any other.  This is true of the appearances which we\\r\\nrecognize as such in common life, and it is equally true of the\\r\\nappearances recognized as such in science.  The pen which I feel\\r\\nbetween my fingers I may regard as appearance and refer to a swarm of\\r\\nmoving atoms.  But it would be silly for me to refer it to atoms \"in\\r\\ngeneral.\"  The reality to which I refer the appearance in question is a\\r\\nparticular group of atoms existing at a particular point in space.  The\\r\\nchemist never supposes that the atoms within the walls of his test-tube\\r\\nare identical with those in the vial on the shelf.  Neither in common\\r\\nlife nor in science would the distinction between appearances and real\\r\\nthings be of the smallest service were it not possible to distinguish\\r\\nbetween this appearance and that, and this reality and that, and to\\r\\nrefer each appearance to its appropriate reality.  Indeed, it is\\r\\ninconceivable that, under such circumstances, the distinction should\\r\\nhave been drawn at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese points ought to be strongly insisted upon, for we find certain\\r\\nphilosophic writers falling constantly into a very curious abuse of the\\r\\ndistinction and making much capital of it.  It is argued that what we\\r\\nsee, what we touch, what we conceive as a result of scientific\\r\\nobservation and reflection--all is, in the last analysis, material\\r\\nwhich is given us in sensation.  The various senses furnish us with\\r\\ndifferent classes of sensations; we work these up into certain\\r\\ncomplexes.  But sensations are only the impressions which something\\r\\noutside of us makes upon us.  Hence, although we seem to ourselves to\\r\\nknow the external world as it is, our knowledge can never extend beyond\\r\\nthe impressions made upon us.  Thus, we are absolutely shut up to\\r\\n_appearances_, and can know nothing about the _reality_ to which they\\r\\nmust be referred.\\r\\n\\r\\nTouching this matter Herbert Spencer writes[1] as follows: \"When we are\\r\\ntaught that a piece of matter, regarded by us as existing externally,\\r\\ncannot be really known, but that we can know only certain impressions\\r\\nproduced on us, we are yet, by the relativity of thought, compelled to\\r\\nthink of these in relation to a cause--the notion of a real existence\\r\\nwhich generated these impressions becomes nascent.  If it be proved\\r\\nthat every notion of a real existence which we can frame is\\r\\ninconsistent with itself,--that matter, however conceived by us, cannot\\r\\nbe matter as it actually is,--our conception, though transfigured, is\\r\\nnot destroyed: there remains the sense of reality, dissociated as far\\r\\nas possible from those special forms under which it was before\\r\\nrepresented in thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means, in plain language, that we must regard everything we know\\r\\nand can know as appearance and must refer it to an unknown reality.\\r\\nSometimes Mr. Spencer calls this reality the Unknowable, sometimes he\\r\\ncalls it the Absolute, and sometimes he allows it to pass by a variety\\r\\nof other names, such as Power, Cause, etc.  He wishes us to think of it\\r\\nas \"lying behind appearances\" or as \"underlying appearances.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably it has already been remarked that this Unknowable has brought\\r\\nus around again to that amusing \"telephone exchange\" discussed in the\\r\\nthird chapter.  But if the reader feels within himself the least\\r\\nweakness for the Unknowable, I beg him to consider carefully, before he\\r\\npins his faith to it, the following:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) If we do perceive external bodies, our own bodies and others, then\\r\\nit is conceivable that we may have evidence from observation to the\\r\\neffect that other bodies affecting our bodies may give rise to\\r\\nsensations.  In this case we cannot say that we know nothing but\\r\\nsensations; we know real bodies as well as sensations, and we may refer\\r\\nthe sensations to the real bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) If we do not perceive that we have bodies, and that our bodies are\\r\\nacted upon by others, we have no evidence that what we call our\\r\\nsensations are due to messages which come from \"external things\" and\\r\\nare conducted along the nerves.  It is then, absurd to talk of such\\r\\n\"external things\" as though they existed, and to call them the reality\\r\\nto which sensations, as appearances, must be referred,\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) In other words, if there is perceived to be a telephone exchange\\r\\nwith its wires and subscribers, we may refer the messages received to\\r\\nthe subscribers, and call this, if we choose, a reference of appearance\\r\\nto reality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if there is perceived no telephone exchange, and if it is concluded\\r\\nthat any wires or subscribers of which it means anything to speak must\\r\\nbe composed of what we have heretofore called \"messages,\" then it is\\r\\npalpably absurd to refer the \"messages\" as a whole to subscribers not\\r\\nsupposed to be composed of \"messages\"; and it is a blunder to go on\\r\\ncalling the things that we know \"messages,\" as though we had evidence\\r\\nthat they came from, and must be referred to, something beyond\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must recognize that, with the general demolition of the exchange, we\\r\\nlose not only known subscribers, but the very notion of a subscriber.\\r\\nIt will not do to try to save from this wreck some \"unknowable\"\\r\\nsubscriber, and still pin our faith to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) We have seen that the relation of appearance to reality is that of\\r\\ncertain experiences to certain other experiences.  When we take the\\r\\nliberty of calling the Unknowable a _reality_, we blunder in our use of\\r\\nthe word.  The Unknowable cannot be an experience either actual,\\r\\npossible, or conceived as possible, and it cannot possibly hold the\\r\\nrelation to any of our experiences that a real thing of any kind holds\\r\\nto the appearances that stand as its signs.\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) Finally, no man has ever made an assumption more perfectly useless\\r\\nand purposeless than the assumption of the Unknowable.  We have seen\\r\\nthat the distinction between appearance and reality is a serviceable\\r\\none, and it has been pointed out that it would be of no service\\r\\nwhatever if it were not possible to refer particular appearances to\\r\\ntheir own appropriate realities.  The realities to which we actually\\r\\nrefer appearances serve to explain them.  Thus, when I ask: Why do I\\r\\nperceive that tree now as faint and blue and now as vivid and green?\\r\\nthe answer to the question is found in the notion of distance and\\r\\nposition in space; it is found, in other words, in a reference to the\\r\\nreal world of touch things, for which visual experiences serve as\\r\\nsigns.  Under certain circumstances, the mountain _ought_ to be robed\\r\\nin its azure hue, and, under certain circumstances, it _ought not_.\\r\\nThe circumstances in each case are open to investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, let us substitute for the real world of touch things, which\\r\\nfurnishes the explanation of given visual experiences, that philosophic\\r\\nfiction, that pseudo-real nonentity, the Unknowable.  Now I perceive a\\r\\ntree as faint and blue, now as bright and green; will a reference to\\r\\nthe Unknowable explain why the experiences differed?  Was the\\r\\nUnknowable in the one instance farther off in an unknowable space, and\\r\\nin the other nearer?  This, even if it means anything, must remain\\r\\nunknowable.  And when the chemist puts together a volume of chlorine\\r\\ngas and a volume of hydrogen gas to get two volumes of hydrochloric\\r\\nacid gas, shall we explain the change which has taken place by a\\r\\nreference to the Unknowable, or shall we turn to the doctrine of atoms\\r\\nand their combinations?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that no man in his senses tries to account for any\\r\\nindividual fact by turning for an explanation to the Unknowable.  It is\\r\\na life-preserver by which some set great store, but which no man dreams\\r\\nof using when he really falls into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, we have any reason to believe that there is a real external\\r\\nworld at all, we have reason to believe that we know what it is.  That\\r\\nsome know it imperfectly, that others know it better, and that we may\\r\\nhope that some day it will be known still more perfectly, is surely no\\r\\ngood reason for concluding that we do not know it at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"First Principles,\" Part I, Chapter IV, section 26.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nOF SPACE\\r\\n\\r\\n23. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT IT.--The plain man may admit\\r\\nthat he is not ready to hazard a definition of space, but he is\\r\\ncertainly not willing to admit that he is wholly ignorant of space and\\r\\nof its attributes.  He knows that it is something in which material\\r\\nobjects have position and in which they move about; he knows that it\\r\\nhas not merely length, like a line, nor length and breadth, like a\\r\\nsurface, but has the three dimensions of length, breadth, and depth; he\\r\\nknows that, except in the one circumstance of its position, every part\\r\\nof space is exactly like every other part, and that, although objects\\r\\nmay move about in space, it is incredible that the spaces themselves\\r\\nshould be shifted about.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who are familiar with the literature of the subject know that it\\r\\nhas long been customary to make regarding space certain other\\r\\nstatements to which the plain man does not usually make serious\\r\\nobjection when he is introduced to them.  Thus it is said:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) The idea of space is _necessary_.  We can think of objects in space\\r\\nas annihilated, but we cannot conceive space to be annihilated.  We can\\r\\nclear space of things, but we cannot clear away space itself, even in\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) Space must be _infinite_.  We cannot conceive that we should come\\r\\nto the end of space.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) Every space, however small, is _infinitely divisible_.  That is to\\r\\nsay, even the most minute space must be composed of spaces.  We cannot,\\r\\neven theoretically, split a solid into mere surfaces, a surface into\\r\\nmere lines, or a line into mere points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst such statements the plain man is not impelled to rise in\\r\\nrebellion, for he can see that there seems to be some ground for making\\r\\nthem.  He can conceive of any particular material object as\\r\\nannihilated, and of the place which it occupied as standing empty; but\\r\\nhe cannot go on and conceive of the annihilation of this bit of empty\\r\\nspace.  Its annihilation would not leave a gap, for a gap means a bit\\r\\nof empty space; nor could it bring the surrounding spaces into\\r\\njuxtaposition, for one cannot shift spaces, and, in any case, a\\r\\nshifting that is not a shifting through space is an absurdity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, he cannot conceive of any journey that would bring him to the\\r\\nend of space.  There is no more reason for stopping at one point than\\r\\nat another; why not go on?  What could end space?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the infinite divisibility of space, have we not, in addition to\\r\\nthe seeming reasonableness of the doctrine, the testimony of all the\\r\\nmathematicians?  Does any one of them ever dream of a line so short\\r\\nthat it cannot be divided into two shorter lines, or of an angle so\\r\\nsmall that it cannot be bisected?\\r\\n\\r\\n24. SPACE AS NECESSARY AND SPACE AS INFINITE.--That these statements\\r\\nabout space contain truth one should not be in haste to deny.  It seems\\r\\nsilly to say that space can be annihilated, or that one can travel\\r\\n\"over the mountains of the moon\" in the hope of reaching the end of it.\\r\\nAnd certainly no prudent man wishes to quarrel with that coldly\\r\\nrational creature the mathematician.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is well worth while to examine the statements carefully and to\\r\\nsee whether there is not some danger that they may be understood in\\r\\nsuch a way as to lead to error.  Let us begin with the doctrine that\\r\\nspace is necessary and cannot be \"thought away.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we have seen above, it is manifestly impossible to annihilate in\\r\\nthought a certain portion of space and leave the other portions intact.\\r\\nThere are many things in the same case.  We cannot annihilate in\\r\\nthought one side of a door and leave the other side; we cannot rob a\\r\\nman of the outside of his hat and leave him the inside.  But we can\\r\\nconceive of a whole door as annihilated, and of a man as losing a whole\\r\\nhat.  May we or may we not conceive of space as a whole as nonexistent?\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not say, be it observed, can we conceive of something as attacking\\r\\nand annihilating space?  Whatever space may be, we none of us think of\\r\\nit as a something that may be threatened and demolished.  I only say,\\r\\nmay we not think of a system of things--not a world such as ours, of\\r\\ncourse, but still a system of things of some sort--in which space\\r\\nrelations have no part?  May we not conceive such to be possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be remarked that space relations are by no means the only\\r\\nones in which we think of things as existing.  We attribute to them\\r\\ntime relations as well.  Now, when we think of occurrences as related\\r\\nto each other in time, we do, in so far as we concentrate our attention\\r\\nupon these relations, turn our attention away from space and\\r\\ncontemplate another aspect of the system of things.  Space is not such\\r\\na necessity of thought that we must keep thinking of space when we have\\r\\nturned our attention to something else.  And is it, indeed,\\r\\ninconceivable that there should be a system of things (not extended\\r\\nthings in space, of course), characterized by time relations and\\r\\nperhaps other relations, but not by space relations?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt goes without saying that we cannot go on thinking of space and at\\r\\nthe same time not think of space.  Those who keep insisting upon space\\r\\nas a necessity of thought seem to set us such a task as this, and to\\r\\nfound their conclusion upon our failure to accomplish it.  \"We can\\r\\nnever represent to ourselves the nonexistence of space,\" says the\\r\\nGerman philosopher Kant (1724-1804), \"although we can easily conceive\\r\\nthat there are no objects in space.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would, perhaps, be fairer to translate the first half of this\\r\\nsentence as follows: \"We can never picture to ourselves the\\r\\nnonexistence of space.\"  Kant says we cannot make of it a\\r\\n_Vorstellung_, a representation.  This we may freely admit, for what\\r\\ndoes one try to do when one makes the effort to imagine the\\r\\nnonexistence of space?  Does not one first clear space of objects, and\\r\\nthen try to clear space of space in much the same way?  We try to\\r\\n\"think space away,\" _i.e. to remove it from the place where it was and\\r\\nyet keep that place_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does it mean to imagine or represent to oneself the nonexistence\\r\\nof material objects?  Is it not to represent to oneself the objects as\\r\\nno longer in space, _i.e._ to imagine the space as empty, as cleared of\\r\\nthe objects?  It means something in this case to speak of a\\r\\n_Vorstellung_, or representation.  We can call before our minds the\\r\\nempty space.  But if we are to think of space as nonexistent, what\\r\\nshall we call before our minds?  Our procedure must not be analogous to\\r\\nwhat it was before; we must not try to picture to our minds _the\\r\\nabsence of space_, as though that were in itself a something that could\\r\\nbe pictured; we must turn our attention to other relations, such as\\r\\ntime relations, and ask whether it is not conceivable that such should\\r\\nbe the only relations obtaining within a given system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who insist upon the fact that we cannot but conceive space as\\r\\ninfinite employ a very similar argument to prove their point.  They set\\r\\nus a self-contradictory task, and regard our failure to accomplish it\\r\\nas proof of their position.  Thus, Sir William Hamilton (1788-1856)\\r\\nargues: \"We are altogether unable to conceive space as bounded--as\\r\\nfinite; that is, as a whole beyond which there is no further space.\"\\r\\nAnd Herbert Spencer echoes approvingly: \"We find ourselves totally\\r\\nunable to imagine bounds beyond which there is no space.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, whatever one may be inclined to think about the infinity of space,\\r\\nit is clear that this argument is an absurd one.  Let me write it out\\r\\nmore at length: \"We are altogether unable to conceive space as\\r\\nbounded--as finite; that is, as a whole _in the space_ beyond which\\r\\nthere is no further space.\"  \"We find ourselves totally unable to\\r\\nimagine bounds, _in the space_ beyond which there is no further space.\"\\r\\nThe words which I have added were already present implicitly.  What can\\r\\nthe word \"beyond\" mean if it does not signify space beyond?  What Sir\\r\\nWilliam and Mr. Spencer have asked us to do is to imagine a limited\\r\\nspace with a _beyond_ and yet _no beyond_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is undoubtedly some reason why men are so ready to affirm that\\r\\nspace is infinite, even while they admit that they do not know that the\\r\\nworld of material things is infinite.  To this we shall come back again\\r\\nlater.  But if one wishes to affirm it, it is better to do so without\\r\\ngiving a reason than it is to present such arguments as the above.\\r\\n\\r\\n25. SPACE AS INFINITELY DIVISIBLE.--For more than two thousand years\\r\\nmen have been aware that certain very grave difficulties seem to attach\\r\\nto the idea of motion, when we once admit that space is infinitely\\r\\ndivisible.  To maintain that we can divide any portion of space up into\\r\\nultimate elements which are not themselves spaces, and which have no\\r\\nextension, seems repugnant to the idea we all have of space.  And if we\\r\\nrefuse to admit this possibility there seems to be nothing left to us\\r\\nbut to hold that every space, however small, may theoretically be\\r\\ndivided up into smaller spaces, and that there is no limit whatever to\\r\\nthe possible subdivision of spaces.  Nevertheless, if we take this most\\r\\nnatural position, we appear to find ourselves plunged into the most\\r\\nhopeless of labyrinths, every turn of which brings us face to face with\\r\\na flat self-contradiction.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo bring the difficulties referred to clearly before our minds, let us\\r\\nsuppose a point to move uniformly over a line an inch long, and to\\r\\naccomplish its journey in a second.  At first glance, there appears to\\r\\nbe nothing abnormal about this proceeding.  But if we admit that this\\r\\nline is infinitely divisible, and reflect upon this property of the\\r\\nline, the ground seems to sink from beneath our feet at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor it is possible to argue that, under the conditions given, the point\\r\\nmust move over one half of the line in half a second; over one half of\\r\\nthe remainder, or one fourth of the line, in one fourth of a second;\\r\\nover one eighth of the line, in one eighth of a second, etc.  Thus the\\r\\nportions of line moved over successively by the point may be\\r\\nrepresented by the descending series:\\r\\n\\r\\n1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, . . . [Greek omicron symbol]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is quite true that the motion of the point can be described in\\r\\na number of different ways; but the important thing to remark here is\\r\\nthat, if the motion really is uniform, and if the line really is\\r\\ninfinitely divisible, this series must, as satisfactorily as any other,\\r\\ndescribe the motion of the point.  And it would be absurd to maintain\\r\\nthat _a part_ of the series can describe the whole motion.  We cannot\\r\\nsay, for example, that, when the point has moved over one half, one\\r\\nfourth, and one eighth of the line, it has completed its motion.  If\\r\\neven a single member of the series is left out, the whole line has not\\r\\nbeen passed over; and this is equally true whether the omitted member\\r\\nrepresent a large bit of line or a small one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole series, then, represents the whole line, as definite parts of\\r\\nthe series represent definite parts of the line.  The line can only be\\r\\ncompleted when the series is completed.  But when and how can this\\r\\nseries be completed?  In general, a series is completed when we reach\\r\\nthe final term, but here there appears to be no final term.  We cannot\\r\\nmake zero the final term, for it does not belong to the series at all.\\r\\nIt does not obey the law of the series, for it is not one half as large\\r\\nas the term preceding it--what space is so small that dividing it by 2\\r\\ngives us [omicron]?  On the other hand, some term just before zero\\r\\ncannot be the final term; for if it really represents a little bit of\\r\\nthe line, however small, it must, by hypothesis, be made up of lesser\\r\\nbits, and a smaller term must be conceivable.  There can, then, be no\\r\\nlast term to the series; _i.e._ what the point is doing at the very\\r\\nlast is absolutely indescribable; it is inconceivable that there should\\r\\nbe a _very last_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was pointed out many centuries ago that it is equally inconceivable\\r\\nthat there should be a _very first_.  How can a point even begin to\\r\\nmove along an infinitely divisible line?  Must it not before it can\\r\\nmove over any distance, however short, first move over half that\\r\\ndistance?  And before it can move over that half, must it not move over\\r\\nthe half of that?  Can it find something to move over that has no\\r\\nhalves?  And if not, how shall it even start to move?  To move at all,\\r\\nit must begin somewhere; it cannot begin with what has no halves, for\\r\\nthen it is not moving over any part of the line, as all parts have\\r\\nhalves; and it cannot begin with what has halves, for that is not the\\r\\nbeginning.  _What does the point do first?_ that is the question.\\r\\nThose who tell us about points and lines usually leave us to call upon\\r\\ngentle echo for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perplexities of this moving point seem to grow worse and worse the\\r\\nlonger one reflects upon them.  They do not harass it merely at the\\r\\nbeginning and at the end of its journey.  This is admirably brought out\\r\\nby Professor W. K. Clifford (1845-1879), an excellent mathematician,\\r\\nwho never had the faintest intention of denying the possibility of\\r\\nmotion, and who did not desire to magnify the perplexities in the path\\r\\nof a moving point.  He writes:--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When a point moves along a line, we know that between any two\\r\\npositions of it there is an infinite number . . . of intermediate\\r\\npositions.  That is because the motion is continuous.  Each of those\\r\\npositions is where the point was at some instant or other.  Between the\\r\\ntwo end positions on the line, the point where the motion began and the\\r\\npoint where it stopped, there is no point of the line which does not\\r\\nbelong to that series.  We have thus an infinite series of successive\\r\\npositions of a continuously moving point, and in that series are\\r\\nincluded all the points of a certain piece of line-room.\" [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we are told that, when a point moves along a line, between any\\r\\ntwo positions of it there is an infinite number of intermediate\\r\\npositions.  Clifford does not play with the word \"infinite\"; he takes\\r\\nit seriously and tells us that it means without any end: \"_Infinite_;\\r\\nit is a dreadful word, I know, until you find out that you are familiar\\r\\nwith the thing which it expresses.  In this place it means that between\\r\\nany two positions there is some intermediate position; between that and\\r\\neither of the others, again, there is some other intermediate; and so\\r\\non _without any end_.  Infinite means without any end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut really, if the case is as stated, the point in question must be at\\r\\na desperate pass.  I beg the reader to consider the following, and ask\\r\\nhimself whether he would like to change places with it:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) If the series of positions is really endless, the point must\\r\\ncomplete one by one the members of an endless series, and reach a\\r\\nnonexistent final term, for a really endless series cannot have a final\\r\\nterm.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) The series of positions is supposed to be \"an infinite series of\\r\\nsuccessive positions.\"  The moving point must take them one after\\r\\nanother.  But how can it?  _Between any two positions of the point\\r\\nthere is an infinite number of intermediate positions_.  That is to\\r\\nsay, no two of these successive positions must be regarded as _next to_\\r\\neach other; every position is separated from every other by an infinite\\r\\nnumber of intermediate ones.  How, then, shall the point move?  It\\r\\ncannot possibly move from one position to the next, for there is no\\r\\nnext.  Shall it move first to some position that is not the next?  Or\\r\\nshall it in despair refuse to move at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidently there is either something wrong with this doctrine of the\\r\\ninfinite divisibility of space, or there is something wrong with our\\r\\nunderstanding of it, if such absurdities as these refuse to be cleared\\r\\naway.  Let us see where the trouble lies.\\r\\n\\r\\n26. WHAT IS REAL SPACE?--It is plain that men are willing to make a\\r\\nnumber of statements about space, the ground for making which is not at\\r\\nonce apparent.  It is a bold man who will undertake to say that the\\r\\nuniverse of matter is infinite in extent.  We feel that we have the\\r\\nright to ask him how he knows that it is.  But most men are ready\\r\\nenough to affirm that space is and must be infinite.  How do they know\\r\\nthat it is?  They certainly do not directly perceive all space, and\\r\\nsuch arguments as the one offered by Hamilton and Spencer are easily\\r\\nseen to be poor proofs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen are equally ready to affirm that space is infinitely divisible.\\r\\nHas any man ever looked upon a line and perceived directly that it has\\r\\nan infinite number of parts?  Did any one ever succeed in dividing a\\r\\nspace up infinitely?  When we try to make clear to ourselves how a\\r\\npoint moves along an infinitely divisible line, do we not seem to land\\r\\nin sheer absurdities?  On what sort of evidence does a man base his\\r\\nstatements regarding space?  They are certainly very bold statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nA careful reflection reveals the fact that men do not speak as they do\\r\\nabout space for no reason at all.  When they are properly understood,\\r\\ntheir statements can be seen to be justified, and it can be seen also\\r\\nthat the difficulties which we have been considering can be avoided.\\r\\nThe subject is a deep one, and it can scarcely be discussed\\r\\nexhaustively in an introductory volume of this sort, but one can, at\\r\\nleast, indicate the direction in which it seems most reasonable to look\\r\\nfor an answer to the questions which have been raised.  How do we come\\r\\nto a knowledge of space, and what do we mean by space?  This is the\\r\\nproblem to solve; and if we can solve this, we have the key which will\\r\\nunlock many doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we saw in the last chapter that we have reason to believe that we\\r\\nknow what the real external world is.  It is a world of things which we\\r\\nperceive, or can perceive, or, not arbitrarily but as a result of\\r\\ncareful observation and deductions therefrom, conceive as though we did\\r\\nperceive it--a world, say, of atoms and molecules.  It is not an\\r\\nUnknowable behind or beyond everything that we perceive, or can\\r\\nperceive, or conceive in the manner stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the space with which we are concerned is real space, the space in\\r\\nwhich real things exist and move about, the real things which we can\\r\\ndirectly know or of which we can definitely know something.  In some\\r\\nsense it must be given in our experience, if the things which are in\\r\\nit, and are known to be in it, are given in our experience.  How must\\r\\nwe think of this real space?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose we look at a tree at a distance.  We are conscious of a certain\\r\\ncomplex of color.  We can distinguish the kind of color; in this case,\\r\\nwe call it blue.  But the quality of the color is not the only thing\\r\\nthat we can distinguish in the experience.  In two experiences of color\\r\\nthe quality may be the same, and yet the experiences may be different\\r\\nfrom each other.  In the one case we may have more of the same\\r\\ncolor--we may, so to speak, be conscious of a larger patch; but even if\\r\\nthere is not actually more of it, there may be such a difference that\\r\\nwe can know from the visual experience alone that the touch object\\r\\nbefore us is, in the one case, of the one shape, and, in the other\\r\\ncase, of another.  Thus we may distinguish between the _stuff_ given in\\r\\nour experience and the _arrangement_ of that stuff.  This is the\\r\\ndistinction which philosophers have marked as that between \"matter\" and\\r\\n\"form.\"  It is, of course, understood that both of these words, so\\r\\nused, have a special sense not to be confounded with their usual one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis distinction between \"matter\" and \"form\" obtains in all our\\r\\nexperiences.  I have spoken just above of the shape of the touch object\\r\\nfor which our visual experiences stand as signs.  What do we mean by\\r\\nits shape?  To the plain man real things are the touch things of which\\r\\nhe has experience, and these touch things are very clearly\\r\\ndistinguishable from one another in shape, in size, in position, nor\\r\\nare the different parts| of the things to be confounded with each\\r\\nother.  Suppose that, as we pass our hand over a table, all the\\r\\nsensations of touch and movement which we experience fused into an\\r\\nundistinguishable mass.  Would we have any notion of size or shape?  It\\r\\nis because our experiences of touch and movement do not fuse, but\\r\\nremain distinguishable from each other, and we are conscious of them as\\r\\n_arranged_, as constituting a system, that we can distinguish between\\r\\nthis part of a thing and that, this thing and that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis arrangement, this order, of what is revealed by touch and\\r\\nmovement, we may call the \"form\" of the touch world.  Leaving out of\\r\\nconsideration, for the present, time relations, we may say that the\\r\\n\"form\" of the touch world is the whole system of actual and possible\\r\\nrelations of arrangement between the elements which make it up.  It is\\r\\nbecause there is such a system of relations that we can speak of things\\r\\nas of this shape or of that, as great or small, as near or far, as here\\r\\nor there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I ask, is there any reason to believe that, when the plain man\\r\\nspeaks of _space_, the word means to him anything more than this system\\r\\nof actual and possible relations of arrangement among the touch things\\r\\nthat constitute his real world?  He may talk sometimes as though space\\r\\nwere some kind of a _thing_, but he does not really think of it as a\\r\\nthing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is evident from the mere fact that he is so ready to make about it\\r\\naffirmations that he would not venture to make about things.  It does\\r\\nnot strike him as inconceivable that a given material object should be\\r\\nannihilated; it does strike him as inconceivable that a portion of\\r\\nspace should be blotted out of existence.  Why this difference?  Is it\\r\\nnot explained when we recognize that space is but a name for all the\\r\\nactual and possible relations of arrangement in which things in the\\r\\ntouch world may stand?  We cannot drop out some of these relations and\\r\\nyet keep _space_, _i.e._ the system of relations which we had before.\\r\\nThat this is what space means, the plain man may not recognize\\r\\nexplicitly, but he certainly seems to recognize it implicitly in what\\r\\nhe says about space.  Men are rarely inclined to admit that space is a\\r\\n_thing_ of any kind, nor are they much more inclined to regard it as a\\r\\nquality of a thing.  Of what could it be the quality?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if space really were a thing of any sort, would it not be the\\r\\nheight of presumption for a man, in the absence of any direct evidence\\r\\nfrom observation, to say how much there is of it--to declare it\\r\\ninfinite?  Men do not hesitate to say that space must be infinite.  But\\r\\nwhen we realize that we do not mean by space merely the actual\\r\\nrelations which exist between the touch things that make up the world,\\r\\nbut also the _possible_ relations, _i.e._ that we mean the whole _plan_\\r\\nof the world system, we can see that it is not unreasonable to speak of\\r\\nspace as infinite.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe material universe may, for aught we know, be limited in extent.\\r\\nThe actual space relations in which things stand to each other may not\\r\\nbe limitless.  But these actual space relations taken alone do not\\r\\nconstitute space.  Men have often asked themselves whether they should\\r\\nconceive of the universe as limited and surrounded by void space.  It\\r\\nis not nonsense to speak of such a state of things.  It would, indeed,\\r\\nappear to be nonsense to say that, if the universe is limited, it does\\r\\nnot lie in void space.  What can we mean by void space but the system\\r\\nof possible relations in which things, if they exist, must stand?  To\\r\\nsay that, beyond a certain point, no further relations are possible,\\r\\nseems absurd.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, when a man has come to understand what we have a right to mean\\r\\nby space, it does not imply a boundless conceit on his part to hazard\\r\\nthe statement that space is infinite.  When he has said this, he has\\r\\nsaid very little.  What shall we say to the statement that space is\\r\\ninfinitely divisible?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo understand the significance of this statement we must come back to\\r\\nthe distinction between appearances and the real things for which they\\r\\nstand as signs, the distinction discussed at length in the last chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I see a tree from a distance, the visual experience which I have\\r\\nis, as we have seen, not an indivisible unit, but is a complex\\r\\nexperience; it has parts, and these parts are related to each other; in\\r\\nother words, it has both \"matter\" and \"form.\"  It is, however, one\\r\\nthing to say that this experience has parts, and it is another to say\\r\\nthat it has an infinite number of parts.  No man is conscious of\\r\\nperceiving an infinite number of parts in the patch of color which\\r\\nrepresents to him a tree at a distance; to say that it is constituted\\r\\nof such strikes us in our moments of sober reflection as a monstrous\\r\\nstatement.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this visual experience is to us the sign of the reality, the real\\r\\ntree; it is not taken as the tree itself.  When we speak of the size,\\r\\nthe shape, the number of parts, of the tree, we do not have in mind the\\r\\nsize, the shape, the number of parts, of just this experience.  We pass\\r\\nfrom the sign to the thing signified, and we may lay our hand upon this\\r\\nthing, thus gaining a direct experience of the size and shape of the\\r\\ntouch object.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must recognize, however, that just as no man is conscious of an\\r\\ninfinite number of parts in what he sees, so no man is conscious of an\\r\\ninfinite number of parts in what he touches.  He who tells me that,\\r\\nwhen I pass my finger along my paper cutter, _what I perceive_ has an\\r\\ninfinite number of parts, tells me what seems palpably untrue.  When an\\r\\nobject is very small, I can see it, and I cannot see that it is\\r\\ncomposed of parts; similarly, when an object is very small, I can feel\\r\\nit with my finger, but I cannot distinguish its parts by the sense of\\r\\ntouch.  There seem to be limits beyond which I cannot go in either case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, men often speak of thousandths of an inch, or of\\r\\nmillionths of an inch, or of distances even shorter.  Have such\\r\\nfractions of the magnitudes that we do know and can perceive any real\\r\\nexistence?  The touch world of real things as it is revealed in our\\r\\nexperience does not appear to be divisible into such; it does not\\r\\nappear to be divisible even so far, and much less does it appear to be\\r\\ninfinitely divisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut have we not seen that the touch world given in our experience must\\r\\nbe taken by the thoughtful man as itself the sign or appearance of a\\r\\nreality more ultimate?  The speck which appears to the naked eye to\\r\\nhave no parts is seen under the microscope to have parts; that is to\\r\\nsay, an experience apparently not extended has become the sign of\\r\\nsomething that is seen to have part out of part.  We have as yet\\r\\ninvented no instrument that will make directly perceptible to the\\r\\nfinger tip an atom of hydrogen or of oxygen, but the man of science\\r\\nconceives of these little things as though they could be perceived.\\r\\nThey and the space in which they move--the system of actual and\\r\\npossible relations between them--seem to be related to the world\\r\\nrevealed in touch very much as the space revealed in the field of the\\r\\nmicroscope is related to the space of the speck looked at with the\\r\\nnaked eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, when the thoughtful man speaks of _real space_, he cannot mean by\\r\\nthe word only the actual and possible relations of arrangement among\\r\\nthe things and the parts of things directly revealed to his sense of\\r\\ntouch.  He may speak of real things too small to be thus perceived, and\\r\\nof their motion as through spaces too small to be perceptible at all.\\r\\nWhat limit shall he set to the possible subdivision of _real_ things?\\r\\nUnless he can find an ultimate reality which cannot in its turn become\\r\\nthe appearance or sign of a further reality, it seems absurd to speak\\r\\nof a limit at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, then, say that real space is infinitely divisible.  By this\\r\\nstatement we should mean that certain experiences may be represented by\\r\\nothers, and that we may carry on our division in the case of the\\r\\nlatter, when a further subdivision of the former seems out of the\\r\\nquestion.  But it should not mean that any single experience furnished\\r\\nus by any sense, or anything that we can represent in the imagination,\\r\\nis composed of an infinite number of parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we realize this, do we not free ourselves from the difficulties\\r\\nwhich seemed to make the motion of a point over a line an impossible\\r\\nabsurdity?  The line as revealed in a single experience either of sight\\r\\nor of touch is not composed of an infinite number of parts.  It is\\r\\ncomposed of points seen or touched--least experiences of sight or\\r\\ntouch, _minima sensibilia_.  These are next to each other, and the\\r\\npoint, in moving, takes them one by one.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut such a single experience is not what we call a line.  It is but one\\r\\nexperience of a line.  Though the experience is not infinitely\\r\\ndivisible, the line may be.  This only means that the visual or tactual\\r\\npoint of the single experience may stand for, may represent, what is\\r\\nnot a mere point but has parts, and is, hence, divisible.  Who can set\\r\\na limit to such possible substitutions? in other words, who can set a\\r\\nlimit to the divisibility of a _real line_?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only when we confuse the single experience with the real line\\r\\nthat we fall into absurdities.  What the mathematician tells us about\\r\\nreal points and real lines has no bearing on the constitution of the\\r\\nsingle experience and its parts.  Thus, when he tells us that between\\r\\nany two points on a line there are an infinite number of other points,\\r\\nhe only means that we may expand the line indefinitely by the system of\\r\\nsubstitutions described above.  We do this for ourselves within limits\\r\\nevery time that we approach from a distance a line drawn on a\\r\\nblackboard.  The mathematician has generalized our experience for us,\\r\\nand that is all he has done.  We should try to get at his real meaning,\\r\\nand not quote him as supporting an absurdity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Seeing and Thinking,\" p. 149.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nOF TIME\\r\\n\\r\\n27. TIME AS NECESSARY, INFINITE, AND INFINITELY DIVISIBLE.--Of course, we\\r\\nall know something about time; we know it as past, present, and future;\\r\\nwe know it as divisible into parts, all of which are successive; we know\\r\\nthat whatever happens must happen in time.  Those who have thought a good\\r\\ndeal about the matter are apt to tell us that time is a necessity of\\r\\nthought, we cannot but think it; that time is and must be infinite; and\\r\\nthat it is infinitely divisible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the same statements that were made regarding space, and, as\\r\\nthey have to be criticised in just the same way, it is not necessary to\\r\\ndwell upon them at great length.  However, we must not pass them over\\r\\naltogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the statement that time is a _necessary_ idea, we may freely admit\\r\\nthat we cannot in thought _annihilate_ time, or _think it away_.  It does\\r\\nnot seem to mean anything to attempt such a task.  Whatever time may be,\\r\\nit does not appear to be a something of such a nature that we can\\r\\ndemolish it or clear it away from something else.  But is it necessarily\\r\\nabsurd to speak of a system of things--not, of course, a system of things\\r\\nin which there is change, succession, an earlier and a later, but still a\\r\\nsystem of things of some sort--in which there obtain no time relations?\\r\\nThe problem is, to be sure, one of theoretical interest merely, for such\\r\\na system of things is not the world we know.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for the infinity of time, may we not ask on what ground any one\\r\\nventures to assert that time is infinite?  No man can say that infinite\\r\\ntime is directly given in his experience.  If one does not directly\\r\\nperceive it to be infinite, must one not seek for some proof of the fact?\\r\\nThe only proof which appears to be offered us is contained in the\\r\\nstatement that we cannot conceive of a time before which there was no\\r\\ntime, nor of a time after which there will be no time; a proof which is\\r\\nno proof, for written out at length it reads as follows: we cannot\\r\\nconceive of a time _in the time_ before which there was no time, nor of a\\r\\ntime _in the time_ after which there will be no time.  As well say: We\\r\\ncannot conceive of a number the number before which was no number, nor of\\r\\na number the number after which will be no number.  Whatever may be said\\r\\nfor the conclusion arrived at, the argument is a very poor one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we turn to the consideration of time as infinitely divisible, we\\r\\nseem to find ourselves confronted with the same difficulties which\\r\\npresented themselves when we thought of space as infinitely divisible.\\r\\nCertainly no man was immediately conscious of an infinite number of parts\\r\\nin the minute which just slipped by.  Shall he assert that it did,\\r\\nnevertheless, contain an infinite number of parts?  Then how did it\\r\\nsucceed in passing? how did it even _begin_ to pass away?  It is\\r\\ninfinitely divisible, that is, there is no end to the number of parts\\r\\ninto which it may be divided; those parts and parts of parts are all\\r\\nsuccessive, no two can pass at once, they must all do it in a certain\\r\\norder, one after the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, something must pass _first_.  What can it be?  If that something\\r\\nhas parts, is divisible, the whole of it cannot pass first.  It must\\r\\nitself pass bit by bit, as must the whole minute; and if it is infinitely\\r\\ndivisible we have precisely the problem that we had at the outset.\\r\\nWhatever passes first cannot, then, have parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us assume that it has no parts, and bid it Godspeed!  Has the minute\\r\\nbegun?  Our minute is, by hypothesis, infinitely divisible; it is\\r\\ncomposed of parts, and those parts of other parts, and so on without end.\\r\\nWe cannot by subdivision come to any part which is itself not composed of\\r\\nsmaller parts.  The partless thing that passed, then, is no part of the\\r\\nminute.  That is all still waiting at the gate, and no member of its\\r\\ntroop can prove that it has a right to lead the rest.  In the same outer\\r\\ndarkness is waiting the point on the line that misbehaved itself in the\\r\\nlast chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n28. THE PROBLEM OF PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.--It seems bad enough to\\r\\nhave on our hands a minute which must pass away in successive bits, and\\r\\nto discover that no bit of it can possibly pass first.  But if we follow\\r\\nwith approval the reflections of certain thinkers, we may find ourselves\\r\\nat such a pass that we would be glad to be able to prove that we may have\\r\\non our hands a minute of any sort.  Men sometimes are so bold as to\\r\\nmaintain that they know time to be infinite; would it not be well for\\r\\nthem to prove first that they can know time at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trouble is this; as was pointed out long ago by Saint Augustine\\r\\n(354-430) in his famous \"Confessions,\" [1] the parts of time are\\r\\nsuccessive, and of the three divisions, past, present, and future, only\\r\\none can be regarded as existing: \"Those two times, past and future, how\\r\\ncan they be, when the past is not now, and the future is not yet?\"  The\\r\\npresent is, it seems, the only existent; how long is the present?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Even a single hour passes in fleeting moments; as much of it as has\\r\\ntaken flight is past, what remains is future.  If we can comprehend any\\r\\ntime that is divisible into no parts at all, or perhaps into the minutest\\r\\nparts of moments, this alone let us call present; yet this speeds so\\r\\nhurriedly from the future to the past that it does not endure even for a\\r\\nlittle space.  If it has duration, it is divided into a past and a\\r\\nfuture; but the present has no duration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where, then, is the time that we may call long?  Is it future?  We do\\r\\nnot say of the future: it _is_ long; for as yet there exists nothing to\\r\\nbe long.  We say: it _will be_ long.  But when?  If while yet future it\\r\\nwill not be long, for nothing will yet exist to be long.  And if it will\\r\\nbe long, when, from a future as yet nonexistent, it has become a present,\\r\\nand has begun to be, that it may be something that is long, then present\\r\\ntime cries out in the words of the preceding paragraph that it cannot be\\r\\nlong.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine\\'s way of presenting the difficulty is a quaint one, but the\\r\\nproblem is as real at the beginning of the twentieth century as it was at\\r\\nthe beginning of the fifth.  Past time does not exist now, future time\\r\\ndoes not exist yet, and present time, it seems, has no duration.  Can a\\r\\nman be said to be conscious of time as past, present, and future?  Who\\r\\ncan be conscious of the nonexistent?  And the existent is not _time_, it\\r\\nhas no duration, there is no before and after in a mere limiting point.\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine\\'s way out of the difficulty is the suggestion that, although we\\r\\ncannot, strictly speaking, measure time, we can measure _memory_ and\\r\\n_expectation_.  Before he begins to repeat a psalm, his expectation\\r\\nextends over the whole of it.  After a little a part of it must be\\r\\nreferred to expectation and a part of it to memory.  Finally, the whole\\r\\npsalm is \"extended along\" the memory.  We can measure this, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how is the psalm in question \"extended along\" the memory or the\\r\\nexpectation?  Are the parts of it successive, or do they thus exist\\r\\nsimultaneously?  If everything in the memory image exists at once, if all\\r\\nbelongs to the punctual present, to the mere point that divides past from\\r\\nfuture, how can a man get from it a consciousness of time, of a something\\r\\nwhose parts cannot exist together but must follow each other?\\r\\n\\r\\nAugustine appears to overlook the fact that on his own hypothesis, the\\r\\npresent, the only existent, the only thing a man can be conscious of, is\\r\\nan indivisible instant.  In such there can be no change; the man who is\\r\\nshut up to such cannot be aware that the past is growing and the future\\r\\ndiminishing.  Any such change as this implies at least two instants, an\\r\\nearlier and a later.  He who has never experienced a change of any sort,\\r\\nwho has never been conscious of the relation of earlier and later, of\\r\\nsuccession, cannot think of the varied content of memory as of _that\\r\\nwhich has been present_.  It cannot mean to him what memory certainly\\r\\nmeans to us; he cannot be conscious of a past, a present, and a future.\\r\\nTo extract the notion of time, of past, present, and future, from an\\r\\nexperience which contains no element of succession, from an indivisible\\r\\ninstant, is as hopeless a task as to extract a line from a mathematical\\r\\npoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears, then, that, if we are to be conscious of time at all, if we\\r\\nare to have the least conception of it, we must have some direct\\r\\nexperience of change.  We cannot really be shut up to that punctual\\r\\npresent, that mere point or limit between past and future, that the\\r\\npresent has been described as being.  But does this not imply that we can\\r\\nbe directly conscious of what is not present, that we can _now_ perceive\\r\\nwhat does _not now_ exist?  How is this possible?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not easy for one whose reading has been somewhat limited in any\\r\\ngiven field to see the full significance of the problems which present\\r\\nthemselves in that field.  Those who read much in the history of modern\\r\\nphilosophy will see that this ancient difficulty touching our\\r\\nconsciousness of time has given rise to some exceedingly curious\\r\\nspeculations, and some strange conclusions touching the nature of the\\r\\nmind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, it has been argued that, since the experience of each moment is\\r\\nsomething quite distinct from the experience of the next, a something\\r\\nthat passes away to give place to its successor, we cannot explain the\\r\\nconsciousness of time, of a whole in which successive moments are\\r\\nrecognized as having their appropriate place, unless we assume a\\r\\nsomething that knows each moment and knits it, so to speak, to its\\r\\nsuccessor.  This something is the self or consciousness, which is\\r\\nindependent of time, and does not exist in time, as do the various\\r\\nexperiences that fill the successive moments.  It is assumed to be\\r\\n_timelessly_ present _at all times_, and thus to connect the nonexistent\\r\\npast with the existent present.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not ask the reader to try to make clear to himself how anything can\\r\\nbe timelessly present at all times, for I do not believe that the words\\r\\ncan be made to represent any clear thought whatever.  Nor do I ask him to\\r\\ntry to conceive how this timeless something can join past and present.  I\\r\\nmerely wish to point out that these modern speculations, which still\\r\\ninfluence the minds of many distinguished men, have their origin in a\\r\\ndifficulty which suggested itself early in the history of reflective\\r\\nthought, and are by no means to be regarded as a gratuitous and useless\\r\\nexercise of the ingenuity.  They are serious attempts to solve a real\\r\\nproblem, though they may be unsuccessful ones, and they are worthy of\\r\\nattention even from those who incline to a different solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n29. WHAT IS REAL TIME?--From the thin air of such speculations as we have\\r\\nbeen discussing let us come back to the world of the plain man, the world\\r\\nin which we all habitually live.  It is from this that we must start out\\r\\nupon all our journeys, and it is good to come back to it from time to\\r\\ntime to make sure of our bearings.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen (Chapter V) that we distinguish between the real and the\\r\\napparent, and that we recognize as the real world the objects revealed to\\r\\nthe sense of touch.  These objects stand to each other in certain\\r\\nrelations of arrangement; that is to say, they exist in space.  And just\\r\\nas we may distinguish between the object as it appears and the object as\\r\\nit is, so we may distinguish between apparent space and real space,\\r\\n_i.e._ between the relations of arrangement, actual and possible, which\\r\\nobtain among the parts of the object as it appears, and those which\\r\\nobtain among the parts of the object as it really is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our experience does not present us only with objects in space\\r\\nrelations; it presents us with a succession of changes in those objects.\\r\\nAnd if we will reason about those changes as we have reasoned about space\\r\\nrelations, many of our difficulties regarding the nature of time may, as\\r\\nit seems, be made to disappear.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we may recognize that we are directly conscious of duration, of\\r\\nsuccession, and may yet hold that this crude and immediate experience of\\r\\nduration is not what we mean by real time.  Every one distinguishes\\r\\nbetween apparent time and real time now and then.  We all know that a\\r\\nsermon may _seem _long and not _be_ long; that the ten years that we live\\r\\nover in a dream are not ten real years; that the swallowing of certain\\r\\ndrugs may be followed by the illusion of the lapse of vast spaces of\\r\\ntime, when really very little time has elapsed.  What is this _real_ time?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is nothing else than the order of the changes which take place or may\\r\\ntake place in real things.  In the last chapter I spoke of space as the\\r\\n\"form\" of the real world; it would be better to call it _a_ \"form\" of the\\r\\nreal world, and to give the same name also to time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very clear that, when we inquire concerning the real time of any\\r\\noccurrence, or ask how long a series of such lasted, we always look for\\r\\nour answer to something that has happened in the external world.  The\\r\\npassage of a star over the meridian, the position of the sun above the\\r\\nhorizon, the arc which the moon has described since our last observation,\\r\\nthe movement of the hands of a clock, the amount of sand which has fallen\\r\\nin the hourglass, these things and such as these are the indicators of\\r\\nreal time.  There may be indicators of a different sort; we may decide\\r\\nthat it is noon because we are hungry, or midnight because we are tired;\\r\\nwe may argue that the preacher must have spoken more than an hour because\\r\\nhe quite wore out the patience of the congregation.  These are more or\\r\\nless uncertain signs of the lapse of time, but they cannot be regarded as\\r\\nexperiences of the passing of time either apparent or real.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we see that real space and real time are the _plan_ of the world\\r\\nsystem.  They are not _things_ of any sort, and they should not be\\r\\nmistaken for things.  They are not known independently of things, though,\\r\\nwhen we have once had an experience of things and their changes, we can\\r\\nby abstraction from the things themselves fix our attention upon their\\r\\narrangement and upon the order of their changes.  We can divide and\\r\\nsubdivide spaces and times without much reference to the things.  But we\\r\\nshould never forget that it would never have occurred to us to do this,\\r\\nindeed, that the whole procedure would be absolutely meaningless to us,\\r\\nwere not a real world revealed in our experience as it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who has attained to this insight into the nature of time is in a\\r\\nposition to offer what seem to be satisfactory solutions to the problems\\r\\nwhich have been brought forward above.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) He can see, thus, why it is absurd to speak of any portion of time as\\r\\nbecoming nonexistent.  Time is nothing else than an order, a great system\\r\\nof relations.  One cannot drop out certain of these and leave the rest\\r\\nunchanged, for the latter imply the former.  Day-after-to-morrow would\\r\\nnot be day-after-to-morrow, if to-morrow did not lie between it and\\r\\nto-day.  To speak of dropping out to-morrow and leaving it the time it\\r\\nwas conceived to be is mere nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) He can see why it does not indicate a measureless conceit for a man\\r\\nto be willing to say that time is infinite.  One who says this need not\\r\\nbe supposed to be acquainted with the whole past and future history of\\r\\nthe real world, of which time is an aspect.  We constantly abstract from\\r\\nthings, and consider only the order of their changes, and in this order\\r\\nitself there is no reason why one should set a limit at some point;\\r\\nindeed, to set such a limit seems a gratuitous absurdity.  He who says\\r\\nthat time is infinite does not say much; he is not affirming the\\r\\nexistence of some sort of a thing; he is merely affirming a theoretical\\r\\npossibility, and is it not a theoretical possibility that there may be an\\r\\nendless succession of real changes in a real world?\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) It is evident, furthermore, that, when one has grasped firmly the\\r\\nsignificance of the distinction between apparent time and real time, one\\r\\nmay with a clear conscience speak of time as infinitely divisible.  Of\\r\\ncourse, the time directly given in any single experience, the minute or\\r\\nthe second of which we are conscious as it passes, cannot be regarded as\\r\\ncomposed of an infinite number of parts.  We are not directly conscious\\r\\nof these subdivisions, and it is a monstrous assumption to maintain that\\r\\nthey must be present in the minute or second as perceived.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no such single experience of duration constitutes what we mean by\\r\\nreal time.  We have seen that real time is the time occupied by the\\r\\nchanges in real things, and the question is, How far can one go in the\\r\\nsubdivision of this time?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the touch thing which usually is for us in common life the real\\r\\nthing is not the real thing for science; it is the appearance under which\\r\\nthe real world of atoms and molecules reveals itself.  The atom is not\\r\\ndirectly perceivable, and we may assign to its motions a space so small\\r\\nthat no one could possibly perceive it as space, as a something with part\\r\\nout of part, a something with a here and a there.  But, as has been\\r\\nbefore pointed out (section 26), this does not prevent us from believing\\r\\nthe atom and the space in which it moves to be real, and we can\\r\\n_represent_ them to ourselves as we can the things and the spaces with\\r\\nwhich we have to do in common life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is with time just as it is with space.  We can perceive an inch to\\r\\nhave parts; we cannot perceive a thousandth of an inch to have parts, if\\r\\nwe can perceive it at all; but we can represent it to ourselves as\\r\\nextended, that is, we can let an experience which is extended stand for\\r\\nit, and can dwell upon the parts of that.  We can perceive a second to\\r\\nhave duration; we cannot perceive a thousandth of a second to have\\r\\nduration; but we can conceive it as having duration, _i.e._ we can let\\r\\nsome experience of duration stand for it and serve as its representative.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, then, reasonable to speak of the space covered by the vibration of\\r\\nan atom, and it is equally reasonable to speak of the time taken up by\\r\\nits vibration.  It is not necessary to believe that the duration that we\\r\\nactually experience as a second must itself be capable of being divided\\r\\nup into the number of parts indicated by the denominator of the fraction\\r\\nthat we use in indicating such a time, and that each of these parts must\\r\\nbe perceived as duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, then, a sense in which we may affirm that time is infinitely\\r\\ndivisible.  But we must remember that apparent time--the time presented\\r\\nin any single experience of duration--is never infinitely divisible; and\\r\\nthat real time, in any save a relative sense of the word, is not a single\\r\\nexperience of duration at all.  It is a recognition of the fact that\\r\\nexperiences of duration may be substituted for each other without\\r\\nassignable limit.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) But what shall we say to the last problem--to the question how we can\\r\\nbe conscious of time at all, when the parts of time are all successive?\\r\\nHow can we even have a consciousness of \"crude\" time, of apparent time,\\r\\nof duration in any sense of the word, when duration must be made up of\\r\\nmoments no two of which can exist together and no one of which alone can\\r\\nconstitute time?  The past is not now, the future is not yet, the present\\r\\nis a mere point, as we are told, and cannot have parts.  If we are\\r\\nconscious of time as past, present, and future, must we not be conscious\\r\\nof a series as a series when every member of it save one is nonexistent?\\r\\nCan a man be conscious of the nonexistent?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulty does seem a serious one, and yet I venture to affirm that,\\r\\nif we examine it carefully, we shall see that it is a difficulty of our\\r\\nown devising.  The argument quietly makes an assumption--and makes it\\r\\ngratuitously--with which any consciousness of duration is incompatible,\\r\\nand then asks us how there can be such a thing as a consciousness of\\r\\nduration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assumption is that _we can be conscious only of the existent_, and\\r\\nthis, written out a little more at length, reads as follows: _we can be\\r\\nconscious only of the now existent_, or, in other words _of the present_.\\r\\nOf course, this determines from the outset that we cannot be conscious of\\r\\nthe past and the future, of duration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe past and the future are, to be sure, nonexistent from the point of\\r\\nview of the present; but it should be remarked as well that the present\\r\\nis nonexistent from the point of view of the past or the future.  If we\\r\\nare talking of time at all we are talking of that no two parts of which\\r\\nare simultaneous; it would be absurd to speak of a past that existed\\r\\nsimultaneously with the present, just as it would be absurd to speak of a\\r\\npresent existing simultaneously with the past.  But we should not deny to\\r\\npast, present, and future, respectively, their appropriate existence; nor\\r\\nis it by any means self-evident that there cannot be a consciousness of\\r\\npast, present, and future as such.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe fall in with the assumption, it seems, because we know very well that\\r\\nwe are not directly conscious of a remote past and a remote future.  We\\r\\nrepresent these to ourselves by means of some proxy--we have present\\r\\nmemories of times long past and present anticipations of what will be in\\r\\nthe time to come.  Moreover, we use the word \"present\" very loosely; we\\r\\nsay the present year, the present day, the present hour, the present\\r\\nminute, or the present second.  When we use the word thus loosely, there\\r\\nseems no reason for believing that there should be such a thing as a\\r\\ndirect consciousness that extends beyond the present.  It appears\\r\\nreasonable to say: No one can be conscious save of the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be remembered, however, that the generous present of common\\r\\ndiscourse is by no means identical with the ideal point between past and\\r\\nfuture dealt with in the argument under discussion.  We all say: I now\\r\\nsee that the cloud is moving; I now see that the snow is falling.  But\\r\\nthere can be no moving, no falling, no change, in the timeless \"now\" with\\r\\nwhich we have been concerned.  Is there any evidence whatever that we are\\r\\nshut up, for all our immediate knowledge, to such a \"now\"?  There is none\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that this timeless \"now\" is a product of reflective thought\\r\\nand not a something of which we are directly conscious.  It is an ideal\\r\\npoint in the real time of which this chapter has treated, the time that\\r\\nis in a certain sense infinitely divisible.  It is first cousin to the\\r\\nideal mathematical point, the mere limit between two lines, a something\\r\\nnot perceptible to any sense.  We have a tendency to carry over to it\\r\\nwhat we recognize to be true of the very different present of common\\r\\ndiscourse, a present which we distinguish from past and future in a\\r\\nsomewhat loose way, but a present in which there certainly is the\\r\\nconsciousness of change, of duration.  And when we do this, we dig for\\r\\nourselves a pit into which we proceed to fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, then, conclude that we are directly conscious of more than the\\r\\npresent, in the sense in which Augustine used the word.  We are conscious\\r\\nof _time_, of \"crude\" time, and from this we can pass to a knowledge of\\r\\nreal time, and can determine its parts with precision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Book XI, Chapters 14 and 15.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII. PROBLEMS TOUCHING THE MIND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT IS THE MIND?\\r\\n\\r\\n30. PRIMITIVE NOTIONS OF MIND.--The soul or mind, that something to\\r\\nwhich we refer sensations and ideas of all sorts, is an object that men\\r\\ndo not seem to know very clearly and definitely, though they feel so\\r\\nsure of its existence that they regard it as the height of folly to\\r\\ncall it in question.  That he has a mind, no man doubts; what his mind\\r\\nis, he may be quite unable to say.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen (section 7) that children, when quite young, can hardly be\\r\\nsaid to recognize that they have minds at all.  This does not mean that\\r\\nwhat is mental is not given in their experience.  They know that they\\r\\nmust open their eyes to see things, and must lay their hands upon them\\r\\nto feel them; they have had pains and pleasures, memories and fancies.\\r\\nIn short, they have within their reach all the materials needed in\\r\\nframing a conception of the mind, and in drawing clearly the\\r\\ndistinction between their minds and external things.  Nevertheless,\\r\\nthey are incapable of using these materials; their attention is\\r\\nengrossed with what is physical,--with their own bodies and the bodies\\r\\nof others, with the things that they can eat, with the toys with which\\r\\nthey can play, and the like.  It is only later that there emerges even\\r\\na tolerably clear conception of a self or mind different from the\\r\\nphysical and contrasted with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrimitive man is almost as material in his thinking as is the young\\r\\nchild.  Of this we have traces in many of the words which have come to\\r\\nbe applied to the mind.  Our word \"spirit\" is from the Latin\\r\\n_spiritus_, originally a breeze.  The Latin word for the soul, the word\\r\\nused by the great philosophers all through the Middle Ages, _anima_\\r\\n(Greek, anemos), has the same significance.  In the Greek New\\r\\nTestament, the word used for spirit (pneuma) carries a similar\\r\\nsuggestion.  When we are told in the Book of Genesis that \"man became a\\r\\nliving soul,\" we may read the word literally \"a breath.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat more natural than that the man who is just awakening to a\\r\\nconsciousness of that elusive entity the mind should confuse it with\\r\\nthat breath which is the most striking outward and visible sign that\\r\\ndistinguishes a living man from a dead one?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat those who first tried to give some scientific account of the soul\\r\\nor mind conceived it as a material thing, and that it was sufficiently\\r\\ncommon to identify it with the breath, we know from direct evidence.  A\\r\\nglance at the Greek philosophy, to which we owe so much that is of\\r\\nvalue in our intellectual life, is sufficient to disclose how difficult\\r\\nit was for thinking men to attain to a higher conception.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, Anaximenes of Miletus, who lived in the sixth century before\\r\\nChrist, says that \"our soul, which is air, rules us.\"  A little later,\\r\\nHeraclitus, a man much admired for the depth of his reflections,\\r\\nmaintains that the soul is a fiery vapor, evidently identifying it with\\r\\nthe warm breath of the living creature.  In the fifth century, B.C.,\\r\\nAnaxagoras, who accounts for the ordering of the elements into a system\\r\\nof things by referring to the activity of Mind or Reason, calls mind\\r\\n\"the finest of things,\" and it seems clear that he did not conceive of\\r\\nit as very different in nature from the other elements which enter into\\r\\nthe constitution of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocritus of Abdera (between 460 and 360 B.C.), that great\\r\\ninvestigator of nature and brilliant writer, developed a materialistic\\r\\ndoctrine that admits the existence of nothing save atoms and empty\\r\\nspace.  He conceived the soul to consist of fine, smooth, round atoms,\\r\\nwhich are also atoms of fire.  These atoms are distributed through the\\r\\nwhole body, but function differently in different places--in the brain\\r\\nthey give us thought, in the heart, anger, and in the liver, desire.\\r\\nLife lasts just so long as we breathe in and breathe out such atoms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine of Democritus was taken up by Epicurus, who founded his\\r\\nschool three hundred years before Christ--a school which lived and\\r\\nprospered for a very long time.  Those who are interested in seeing how\\r\\na materialistic psychology can be carried out in detail by an ingenious\\r\\nmind should read the curious account of the mind presented in his great\\r\\npoem, \"On Nature,\" by the Roman poet Lucretius, an ardent Epicurean,\\r\\nwho wrote in the first century B.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe school which we commonly think of contrasting with the Epicurean,\\r\\nand one which was founded at about the same time, is that of the\\r\\nStoics.  Certainly the Stoics differed in many things from the\\r\\nEpicureans; their view of the world, and of the life of man, was a much\\r\\nnobler one; but they were uncompromising materialists, nevertheless,\\r\\nand identified the soul with the warm breath that animates man.\\r\\n\\r\\n31. THE MIND AS IMMATERIAL.--It is scarcely too much to say that the\\r\\nGreek philosophy as a whole impresses the modern mind as representing\\r\\nthe thought of a people to whom it was not unnatural to think of the\\r\\nmind as being a breath, a fire, a collection of atoms, a something\\r\\nmaterial.  To be sure, we cannot accuse those twin stars that must ever\\r\\nremain the glory of literature and science, Plato and Aristotle, of\\r\\nbeing materialists.  Plato (427-347, B.C.) distributes, it is true, the\\r\\nthree-fold soul, which he allows man, in various parts of the human\\r\\nbody, in a way that at least suggests the Democritean distribution of\\r\\nmind-atoms.  The lowest soul is confined beneath the diaphragm; the one\\r\\nnext in rank has its seat in the chest; and the highest, the rational\\r\\nsoul, is enthroned in the head.  However, he has said quite enough\\r\\nabout this last to indicate clearly that he conceived it to be free\\r\\nfrom all taint of materiality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Aristotle (384-322, B.C.),  who also distinguished between the\\r\\nlower psychical functions and the higher, we find him sometimes\\r\\nspeaking of soul and body in such a way as to lead men to ask\\r\\nthemselves whether he is really speaking of two things at all; but when\\r\\nhe specifically treats of the _nous_ or reason, he insists upon its\\r\\ncomplete detachment from everything material.  Man\\'s reason is not\\r\\nsubjected to the fate of the lower psychical functions, which, as the\\r\\n\"form\" of the body, perish with the body; it enters from without, and\\r\\nit endures after the body has passed away.  It is interesting to note,\\r\\nhowever, an occasional lapse even in Aristotle.  When he comes to speak\\r\\nof the relation to the world of the Divine Mind, the First Cause of\\r\\nMotion, which he conceives as pure Reason, he represents it as\\r\\n_touching_ the world, although it remains itself _untouched_.  We seem\\r\\nto find here just a flavor--an inconsistent one--of the material.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch reflections as those of Plato and Aristotle bore fruit in later\\r\\nages.  When we come down to Plotinus the Neo-Platonist (204-269, A.D.),\\r\\nwe have left the conception of the soul as a warm breath, or as\\r\\ncomposed of fine round atoms, far behind.  It has become curiously\\r\\nabstract and incomprehensible.  It is described as an immaterial\\r\\nsubstance  This substance is, in a sense, in the body, or, at least, it\\r\\nis present to the body.  But it is not in the body as material things\\r\\nare in this place or in that.  _It is as a whole in the whole body, and\\r\\nit is as a whole in every part of the body_.  Thus the soul may be\\r\\nregarded as divisible, since it is distributed throughout the body; but\\r\\nit must also be regarded as indivisible, since it is wholly in every\\r\\npart.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet the man to whom such sentences as these mean anything rejoice in\\r\\nthe meaning that he is able to read into them!  If he can go as far as\\r\\nPlotinus, perhaps he can go as far as Cassiodorus (477-570, A.D.), and\\r\\nmaintain that the soul is not merely as a whole in every part of the\\r\\nbody, but is wholly in each of its own parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon reading such statements one\\'s first impulse is to exclaim: How is\\r\\nit possible that men of sense should be led to speak in this\\r\\nirresponsible way? and when they do speak thus, is it conceivable that\\r\\nother men should seriously occupy themselves with what they say?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if one has the historic sense, and knows something of the setting\\r\\nin which such doctrines come to the birth, one cannot regard it as\\r\\nremarkable that men of sense should urge them.  No one coins them\\r\\nindependently out of his own brain; little by little men are impelled\\r\\nalong the path that leads to such conclusions.  Plotinus was a careful\\r\\nstudent of the philosophers that preceded him.  He saw that mind must\\r\\nbe distinguished from matter, and he saw that what is given a location\\r\\nin space, in the usual sense of the words, is treated like a material\\r\\nthing.  On the other hand, he had the common experience that we all\\r\\nhave of a relation between mind and body.  How do justice to this\\r\\nrelation, and yet not materialize mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat he tried to do is clear, and it seems equally clear that he had\\r\\ngood reason for trying to do it.  But it appears to us now that what he\\r\\nactually did was to make of the mind or soul a something very like an\\r\\ninconsistent bit of matter, that is somehow in space, and yet not\\r\\nexactly in space, a something that can be in two places at once, a\\r\\nlogical monstrosity.  That his doctrine did not meet with instant\\r\\nrejection was due to the fact, already alluded to, that our experience\\r\\nof the mind is something rather dim and elusive.  It is not easy for a\\r\\nman to say what it is, and, hence, it is not easy for a man to say what\\r\\nit is not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine of Plotinus passed over to Saint Augustine, and from him\\r\\nit passed to the philosophers of the Middle Ages.  How extremely\\r\\ndifficult it has been for the world to get away from it at all, is made\\r\\nclearly evident in the writings of that remarkable man Descartes.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes wrote in the seventeenth century.  The long sleep of the\\r\\nMiddle Ages was past, and the several sciences had sprung into a\\r\\nvigorous and independent life.  It was not enough for Descartes to\\r\\ndescribe the relation of mind and body in the loose terms that had\\r\\nprevailed up to his time.  He had made a careful study of anatomy, and\\r\\nhe realized that the brain is a central organ to which messages are\\r\\ncarried by the nerves from all parts of the body.  He knew that an\\r\\ninjury to the nerve might prevent the receipt of a message, _i.e._ he\\r\\nknew that a conscious sensation did not come into being until something\\r\\nhappened in the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was he content merely to refer the mind to the brain in a general\\r\\nway.  He found the \"little pineal gland\" in the midst of the brain to\\r\\nbe in what he regarded as an admirable position to serve as the seat of\\r\\nthe soul.  To this convenient little central office he relegated it;\\r\\nand he describes in a way that may to-day well provoke a smile the\\r\\nmovements that the soul imparts to the pineal gland, making it incline\\r\\nitself in this direction and in that, and making it push the \"animal\\r\\nspirits,\" the fluid contained in the cavities of the brain, towards\\r\\nvarious \"pores.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThus he writes:[1] \"Let us, then, conceive of the soul as having her\\r\\nchief seat in the little gland that is in the middle of the brain,\\r\\nwhence she radiates to all the rest of the body by means of the\\r\\nspirits, the nerves, and even the blood, which, participating in the\\r\\nimpressions of the spirits, can carry them through the arteries to all\\r\\nthe members.\"  And again: \"Thus, when the soul wills to call anything\\r\\nto remembrance, this volition brings it about that the gland, inclining\\r\\nitself successively in different directions, pushes the spirits towards\\r\\ndivers parts of the brain, until they find the part which has the\\r\\ntraces that the object which one wishes to recollect has left there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must admit that Descartes\\' scientific studies led him to make this\\r\\nmind that sits in the little pineal gland something very material.  It\\r\\nis spoken of as though it pushed the gland about; it is affected by the\\r\\nmotions of the gland, as though it were a bit of matter.  It seems to\\r\\nbe a less inconsistent thing than the \"all in the whole body\" soul of\\r\\nPlotinus; but it appears to have purchased its comprehensibility at the\\r\\nexpense of its immateriality.\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we say that Descartes frankly repudiated the doctrine that had\\r\\nobtained for so many centuries?  We cannot say that; he still held to\\r\\nit.  But how could he?  The reader has perhaps remarked above that he\\r\\nspeaks of the soul as having her _chief_ seat in the pineal gland.  It\\r\\nseems odd that he should do so, but he still held, even after he had\\r\\ncome to his definite conclusions as to the soul\\'s seat, to the ancient\\r\\ndoctrine that the soul is united to all the parts of the body\\r\\n\"conjointly.\"  He could not wholly repudiate a venerable tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen, thus, that men first conceived of the mind as material\\r\\nand later came to rebel against such a conception.  But we have seen,\\r\\nalso, that the attempt to conceive it as immaterial was not wholly\\r\\nsuccessful.  It resulted in a something that we may describe as\\r\\ninconsistently material rather than as not material at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n32. MODERN COMMON SENSE NOTIONS OF THE MIND.--Under this heading I mean\\r\\nto sum up the opinions as to the nature of the mind usually held by the\\r\\nintelligent persons about us to-day who make no claim to be regarded as\\r\\nphilosophers.  Is it not true that a great many of them believe:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) That the mind is in the body?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) That it acts and reacts with matter?\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) That it is a substance with attributes?\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) That it is nonextended and immaterial?\\r\\n\\r\\nI must remark at the outset that this collection of opinions is by no\\r\\nmeans something gathered by the plain man from his own experience.\\r\\nThese opinions are the echoes of old philosophies.  They are a heritage\\r\\nfrom the past, and have become the common property of all intelligent\\r\\npersons who are even moderately well-educated.  Their sources have been\\r\\nindicated in the preceding sections; but most persons who cherish them\\r\\nhave no idea of their origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen are apt to suppose that these opinions seem reasonable to them\\r\\nmerely for the reason that they find in their own experience evidence\\r\\nof their truth.  But this is not so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave we not seen above how long it took men to discover that they must\\r\\nnot think of the mind as being a breath, or a flame, or a collection of\\r\\nmaterial atoms?  The men who erred in this way were abler than most of\\r\\nus can pretend to be, and they gave much thought to the matter.  And\\r\\nwhen at last it came to be realized that mind must not thus be\\r\\nconceived as material, those who endeavored to conceive it as something\\r\\nelse gave, after their best efforts, a very queer account of it indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it in the face of such facts reasonable to suppose that our friends\\r\\nand acquaintances, who strike us as having reflective powers in nowise\\r\\nremarkable, have independently arrived at the conception that the mind\\r\\nis a nonextended and immaterial substance?  Surely they have not\\r\\nthought all this out for themselves.  They have taken up and\\r\\nappropriated unconsciously notions which were in the air, so to speak.\\r\\nThey have inherited their doctrines, not created them.  It is well to\\r\\nremember this, for it may make us the more willing to take up and\\r\\nexamine impartially what we have uncritically turned into articles of\\r\\nbelief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first two articles, namely, that the mind is in the body and that\\r\\nit acts upon, and is acted upon by, material things, I shall discuss at\\r\\nlength in the next chapter.  Here I pause only to point out that the\\r\\nplain man does not put the mind into the body quite unequivocally.  I\\r\\nthink it would surprise him to be told that a line might be drawn\\r\\nthrough two heads in such a way as to transfix two minds.  And I\\r\\nremark, further, that he has no clear idea of what it means for mind to\\r\\nact upon body or body to act upon mind.  How does an immaterial thing\\r\\nset a material thing in motion?  Can it touch it?  Can it push it?\\r\\nThen what does it do?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let us pass on to the last two articles of faith mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all draw the distinction between _substance_ and its _attributes_ or\\r\\n_qualities_.  The distinction was remarked and discussed many centuries\\r\\nago, and much has been written upon it.  I take up the ruler on my\\r\\ndesk; it is recognized at once as a bit of wood.  How?  It has such and\\r\\nsuch qualities.  My paper-knife is of silver.  How do I know it?  It\\r\\nhas certain other qualities.  I speak of my mind.  How do I know that I\\r\\nhave a mind?  I have sensations and ideas.  If I experienced no mental\\r\\nphenomena of any sort, evidence of the existence of a mind would be\\r\\nlacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, whether I am concerned with the ruler, with the paper-knife, or\\r\\nwith the mind, have I direct evidence of the existence of anything more\\r\\nthan the whole group of qualities?  Do I ever perceive the substance?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the older philosophy, the substance (_substantia_) was conceived to\\r\\nbe a something not directly perceived, but only inferred to exist--a\\r\\nsomething underlying the qualities of things and, as it were, holding\\r\\nthem together.  It was believed in by philosophers who were quite ready\\r\\nto admit that they could not tell anything about it.  For example, John\\r\\nLocke (1632-1704), the English philosopher, holds to it stoutly, and\\r\\nyet describes it as a mere \"we know not what,\" whose function it is to\\r\\nhold together the bundles of qualities that constitute the things we\\r\\nknow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern philosophy men still distinguish between substance and\\r\\nqualities.  It is a useful distinction, and we could scarcely get on\\r\\nwithout it.  But an increasing number of thoughtful persons repudiate\\r\\nthe old notion of substance altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, they say, understand by the word \"substance\" the whole group of\\r\\nqualities _as a group_--not merely the qualities that are revealed at a\\r\\ngiven time, but all those that we have reason to believe a fuller\\r\\nknowledge would reveal.  In short, we may understand by it just what is\\r\\nleft when the \"we know not what\" of the Lockian has been discarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis notion of substance we may call the more modern one; yet we can\\r\\nhardly say that it is the notion of the plain man.  He does not make\\r\\nvery clear to himself just what is in his thought, but I think we do\\r\\nhim no injustice in maintaining that he is something of a Lockian, even\\r\\nif he has never heard of Locke.  The Lockian substance is, as the\\r\\nreader has seen, a sort of \"unknowable.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now for the doctrine that the mind is nonextended and immaterial.\\r\\nWith these affirmations we may heartily agree; but we must admit that\\r\\nthe plain man enunciates them without having a very definite idea of\\r\\nwhat the mind is.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe regards as in his mind all his sensations and ideas, all his\\r\\nperceptions and mental images of things.  Now, suppose I close my eyes\\r\\nand picture to myself a barber\\'s pole.  Where is the image?  We say, in\\r\\nthe mind.  Is it extended?  We feel impelled to answer, No.  But it\\r\\ncertainly _seems_ to be extended; the white and the red upon it appear\\r\\nundeniably side by side.  May I assert that this mental image has no\\r\\nextension whatever?  Must I deny to it _parts_, or assert that its\\r\\nparts are not side by side?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems odd to maintain that a something as devoid of parts as is a\\r\\nmathematical point should yet appear to have parts and to be extended.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if we allow the image to be extended, how can we\\r\\nrefer it to a nonextended mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo such questions as these, I do not think that the plain man has an\\r\\nanswer.  That they can be answered, I shall try to show in the last\\r\\nsection of this chapter.  But one cannot answer them until one has\\r\\nattained to rather a clear conception of what is meant by the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd until one has attained to such a conception, the statement that the\\r\\nmind is immaterial must remain rather vague and indefinite.  As we saw\\r\\nabove, even the Plotinic soul was inconsistently material rather than\\r\\nimmaterial.  It was not excluded from space; it was referred to space\\r\\nin an absurd way.  The mind as common sense conceives it, is the\\r\\nsuccessor of this Plotinic soul, and seems to keep a flavor of what is\\r\\nmaterial after all.  This will come out in the next chapter, where we\\r\\nshall discuss mind and body.\\r\\n\\r\\n33. THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND THE MIND.--When we ask how the psychologist\\r\\nconceives of the mind, we must not forget that psychologists are many\\r\\nand that they differ more or less from each other in their opinions.\\r\\nWhen we say \"the psychologist\" believes this or that, we mean usually\\r\\nno more than that the opinion referred to is prevalent among men of\\r\\nthat class, or that it is the opinion of those whom we regard as its\\r\\nmore enlightened members.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the words in this somewhat loose sense, I shall ask what the\\r\\npsychologist\\'s opinion is touching the four points set forth in the\\r\\npreceding section.  How far does he agree with the plain man?\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) There can be no doubt that he refers the mind to the body in some\\r\\nway, although he may shake his head over the use of the word \"in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) As to whether the mind acts and reacts with matter, in any sense of\\r\\nthe words analogous to that in which they are commonly used, there is a\\r\\ndivision in the camp.  Some affirm such interaction; some deny it.  The\\r\\nmatter will be discussed in the next chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) The psychologist--the more modern one--inclines to repudiate any\\r\\nsubstance or substratum of the sort accepted in the Middle Ages and\\r\\nbelieved in by many men now.  To him the mind is the whole complex of\\r\\nmental phenomena in their interrelations.  In other words, the mind is\\r\\nnot an unknown and indescribable something that is merely inferred; it\\r\\nis something revealed in consciousness and open to observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) The psychologist is certainly not inclined to regard the mind or\\r\\nany idea belonging to it as material or as extended.  But he does\\r\\nrecognize implicitly, if not explicitly, that ideas are composite.  To\\r\\nhim, as to the plain man, the image held in the memory or imagination\\r\\n_seems_ to be extended, and he can distinguish its parts.  He does not\\r\\ndo much towards clearing away the difficulty alluded to at the close of\\r\\nthe last section.  It remains for the metaphysician to do what he can\\r\\nwith it, and to him we must turn if we wish light upon this obscure\\r\\nsubject.\\r\\n\\r\\n34. THE METAPHYSICIAN AND THE MIND.--I have reserved for the next\\r\\nchapter the first two points mentioned as belonging to the plain man\\'s\\r\\ndoctrine of the mind.  In what sense the mind may be said to be in the\\r\\nbody, and how it may be conceived to be related to the body, are topics\\r\\nthat deserve to be treated by themselves in a chapter on \"Mind and\\r\\nBody.\"  Here I shall consider what the metaphysician has to say about\\r\\nthe mind as substance, and about the mind as nonextended and immaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that the Lockian substance is really an \"unknowable.\"\\r\\nNo one pretends to have experience of it; it is revealed to no sense;\\r\\nit is, indeed, a name for a mere nothing, for when we abstract from a\\r\\nthing, in thought, every single quality, we find that there is left to\\r\\nus nothing whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot say that the substance, in this sense of the word, is the\\r\\n_reality_ of which the qualities are _appearances_.  In Chapter V we\\r\\nsaw just what we may legitimately mean by realities and appearances,\\r\\nand it was made clear that an unknowable of any sort cannot possibly be\\r\\nthe reality to which this or that appearance is referred.  Appearances\\r\\nand realities are experiences which are observed to be related in\\r\\ncertain ways.  That which is not open to observation at all, that of\\r\\nwhich we have, and can have, no experience, we have no reason to call\\r\\nthe reality of anything.  We have, in truth, no reason to talk about it\\r\\nat all, for we know nothing whatever about it; and when we do talk\\r\\nabout it, it is because we are laboring under a delusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is equally true whether we are concerned with the substance of\\r\\nmaterial things or with the substance of minds.  An \"unknowable\" is an\\r\\n\"unknowable\" in any case, and we may simply discard it.  We lose\\r\\nnothing by so doing, for one cannot lose what one has never had, and\\r\\nwhat, by hypothesis, one can never have.  The loss of a mere word\\r\\nshould occasion us no regret.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we have seen that we do not lose the world of real material things\\r\\nin rejecting the \"Unknowable\" (Chapter V).  The things are complexes of\\r\\nqualities, of physical phenomena; and the more we know about these, the\\r\\nmore do we know about real things.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have also seen (Chapter IV) that physical phenomena are not the\\r\\nonly phenomena of which we have experience.  We are conscious of mental\\r\\nphenomena as well, of the phenomena of the subjective order, of\\r\\nsensations and ideas.  Why not admit that these _constitute_ the mind,\\r\\nas physical phenomena constitute the things which belong to the\\r\\nexternal world?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who says this says no more than that the mind is known and is\\r\\nknowable.  It is what it is perceived to be; and the more we know of\\r\\nmental phenomena, the more do we know of the mind.  Shall we call the\\r\\nmind as thus known a _substance_?  That depends on the significance\\r\\nwhich we give to this word.  It is better, perhaps, to avoid it, for it\\r\\nis fatally easy to slip into the old use of the word, and then to say,\\r\\nas men have said, that we do not know the mind as it is, but only as it\\r\\nappears to us to be--that we do not know the reality, but only its\\r\\nappearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if we keep clearly before us the view of the mind which I am\\r\\nadvocating, we shall find an easy way out of the difficulties that seem\\r\\nto confront us when we consider it as nonextended and immaterial.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain complexes of mental phenomena--for example, the barber\\'s pole\\r\\nabove alluded to--certainly appear to be extended.  Are they really\\r\\nextended?  If I imagine a tree a hundred feet high, is it really a\\r\\nhundred feet high?  Has it any real size at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur problem melts away when we realize what we mean by this \"real\\r\\nsize.\"  In Chapter V, I have distinguished between apparent space and\\r\\nreal space.  Real space is, as was pointed out, the \"plan\" of the real\\r\\nphysical world.  To occupy any portion of real space, a thing must be a\\r\\nreal external thing; that is, the experiences constituting it must\\r\\nbelong to the objective order, they must not be of the class called\\r\\nmental.  We all recognize this, in a way.  We know that a real material\\r\\nfoot rule cannot be applied to an imaginary tree.  We say, How big did\\r\\nthe tree seen in a dream _seem_; we do not say, How big was it\\r\\n_really_?  If we did ask such a question, we should be puzzled to know\\r\\nwhere to look for an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this for a very good reason.  He who asks: How big was that\\r\\nimaginary tree really? asks, in effect: How much real space did the\\r\\nunreal tree fill?  The question is a foolish one.  It assumes that\\r\\nphenomena not in the objective order are in the objective order.  As\\r\\nwell ask how a color smells or how a sound looks.  When we are dealing\\r\\nwith the material we are not dealing with the mental, and we must never\\r\\nforget this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tree imagined or seen in a dream seems extended.  Its extension is\\r\\n_apparent_ extension, and this apparent extension has no place in the\\r\\nexternal world whatever.  But we must not confound this apparent\\r\\nextension with a real mathematical point, and call the tree nonextended\\r\\nin this sense.  If we do this we are still in the old error--we have\\r\\nnot gotten away from real space, but have substituted position in that\\r\\nspace for extension in that space.  Nothing mental can have even a\\r\\nposition in real space.  To do that it would have to be a real thing in\\r\\nthe sense indicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us, then, agree with the plain man in affirming that the mind is\\r\\nnonextended, but let us avoid misconception.  The mind is constituted\\r\\nof experiences of the subjective order.  None of these are in\\r\\nspace--real space.  But some of them have apparent extension, and we\\r\\nmust not overlook all that this implies.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow for the mind as immaterial.  We need not delay long over this\\r\\npoint.  If we mean by the mind the phenomena of the subjective order,\\r\\nand by what is material the phenomena of the objective order, surely we\\r\\nmay and must say that the mind is immaterial.  The two classes of\\r\\nphenomena separate themselves out at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"The Passions,\" Articles 34 and 42.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nMIND AND BODY\\r\\n\\r\\n35. IS THE MIND IN THE BODY?--There was a time, as we have seen in the\\r\\nlast chapter (section 30), when it did not seem at all out of the way\\r\\nto think of the mind as in the body, and very literally in the body.\\r\\nHe who believes the mind to be a breath, or a something composed of\\r\\nmaterial atoms, can conceive it as being in the body as unequivocally\\r\\nas chairs can be in a room.  Breath can be inhaled and exhaled; atoms\\r\\ncan be in the head, or in the chest, or the heart, or anywhere else in\\r\\nthe animal economy.  There is nothing dubious about this sense of the\\r\\npreposition \"in.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have also seen (section 31) that, as soon as men began to\\r\\nrealize that the mind is not material, the question of its presence in\\r\\nthe body became a serious problem.  If I say that a chair is in a room,\\r\\nI say what is comprehensible to every one.  It is assumed that it is in\\r\\na particular place in the room and is not in some other place.  If,\\r\\nhowever, I say that the chair is, as a whole, in every part of the room\\r\\nat once, I seem to talk nonsense.  This is what Plotinus and those who\\r\\ncame after him said about the mind.  Are their statements any the less\\r\\nnonsensical because they are talking about minds?  When one speaks\\r\\nabout things mental, one must not take leave of good sense and utter\\r\\nunmeaning phrases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf minds are enough like material things to be in anything, they must\\r\\nbe in things in some intelligible sense of the word.  It will not do to\\r\\nsay: I use the word \"in,\" but I do not really mean _in_.  If the\\r\\nmeaning has disappeared, why continue to use the word?  It can only\\r\\nlead to mystification.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes seemed to come back to something like an intelligible meaning\\r\\nwhen he put the mind in the pineal gland in the brain.  Yet, as we have\\r\\nseen, he clung to the old conception.  He could not go back to the\\r\\nfrank materialization of mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the plain man to-day labors under the same difficulty.  He puts the\\r\\nmind in the body, in the brain, but he does not put it there frankly\\r\\nand unequivocally.  It is in the brain and yet not exactly in the\\r\\nbrain.  Let us see if this is not the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we ask him: Does the man who wags his head move his mind about? does\\r\\nhe who mounts a step raise his mind some inches? does he who sits down\\r\\non a chair lower his mind?  I think we shall find that he hesitates in\\r\\nhis answers.  And if we go on to say: Could a line be so drawn as to\\r\\npass through your image of me and my image of you, and to measure their\\r\\ndistance from one another?  I think he will say, No.  He does not\\r\\nregard minds and their ideas as existing in space in this fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it would not strike the plain man as absurd if we said to\\r\\nhim: Were our senses far more acute than they are, it is conceivable\\r\\nthat we should be able to perceive every atom in a given human body,\\r\\nand all its motions.  But would he be willing to admit that an increase\\r\\nin the sharpness of sense would reveal to us directly the mind\\r\\nconnected with such a body?  It is not, then, in the body as the atoms\\r\\nare.  It cannot be seen or touched under any conceivable circumstances.\\r\\nWhat can it mean, hence, to say that it is _there_?  Evidently, the\\r\\nword is used in a peculiar sense, and the plain man cannot help us to a\\r\\nclear understanding of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis position becomes intelligible to us when we realize that he has\\r\\ninherited the doctrine that the mind is immaterial, and that he\\r\\nstruggles, at the same time, with the tendency so natural to man to\\r\\nconceive it after the analogy of things material.  He thinks of it as\\r\\nin the body, and, nevertheless, tries to dematerialize this \"in.\"  His\\r\\nthought is sufficiently vague, and is inconsistent, as might be\\r\\nexpected.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we will bear in mind what was said in the closing section of the\\r\\nlast chapter, we can help him over his difficulty.  That mind and body\\r\\nare related there can be no doubt.  But should we use the word \"in\" to\\r\\nexpress this relation?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe body is a certain group of phenomena in the objective order; that\\r\\nis, it is a part of the external world.  The mind consists of\\r\\nexperiences in the subjective order.  We have seen that no mental\\r\\nphenomenon can occupy space--real space, the space of the external\\r\\nworld--and that it cannot even have a position in space (section 34).\\r\\nAs mental, it is excluded from the objective order altogether.  The\\r\\nmind is not, then, strictly speaking, _in_ the body, although it is\\r\\nrelated to it.  It remains, of course, to ask ourselves how we ought to\\r\\nconceive the relation.  This we shall do later in the present chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, it may be said, it would sound odd to deny that the mind is in the\\r\\nbody.  Does not every one use the expression?  What can we substitute\\r\\nfor it?  I answer: If it is convenient to use the expression let us\\r\\ncontinue to do so.  Men must talk so as to be understood.  But let us\\r\\nnot perpetuate error, and, as occasion demands it, let us make clear to\\r\\nourselves and to others what we have a right to understand by this _in_\\r\\nwhen we use it.\\r\\n\\r\\n36. THE DOCTRINE OF THE INTERACTIONIST.--There is no man who does not\\r\\nknow that his mind is related to his body as it is not to other\\r\\nmaterial things.  We open our eyes, and we see things; we stretch out\\r\\nour hand, and we feel them; our body receives a blow, and we feel pain;\\r\\nwe wish to move, and the muscles are set in motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese things are matters of common experience.  We all perceive, in\\r\\nother words, that there is an interaction, in some sense of the term,\\r\\nbetween mind and body.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is important to realize that one may be quite well aware of all\\r\\nsuch facts, and yet may have very vague notions of what one means by\\r\\nbody and by mind, and may have no definite theory at all of the sort of\\r\\nrelation that obtains between them.  The philosopher tries to attain to\\r\\na clearer conception of these things.  His task, be it remembered, is\\r\\nto analyze and explain, not to deny, the experiences which are the\\r\\ncommon property of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the present day the two theories of the relation of mind and body\\r\\nthat divide the field between them and stand opposed to each other are\\r\\n_interactionism_ and _parallelism_.  I have used the word \"interaction\"\\r\\na little above in a loose sense to indicate our common experience of\\r\\nthe fact that we become conscious of certain changes brought about in\\r\\nour body, and that our purposes realize themselves in action.  But\\r\\nevery one who accepts this fact is not necessarily an interactionist.\\r\\nThe latter is a man who holds a certain more or less definite theory as\\r\\nto what is implied by the fact.  Let us take a look at his doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysical things interact.  A billiard ball in motion strikes one which\\r\\nhas been at rest; the former loses its motion, the latter begins to\\r\\nroll away.  We explain the occurrence by a reference to the laws of\\r\\nmechanics; that is to say, we point out that it is merely an instance\\r\\nof the uniform behavior of matter in motion under such and such\\r\\ncircumstances.  We distinguish between the state of things at one\\r\\ninstant and the state of things at the next, and we call the former\\r\\n_cause_ and the latter _effect_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be observed that both cause and effect here belong to the one\\r\\norder, the objective order.  They have their place in the external\\r\\nworld.  Both the balls are material things; their motion, and the space\\r\\nin which they move, are aspects of the external world.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the balls did not exist in the same space, if the motion of the one\\r\\ncould not be towards or away from the other, if contact were\\r\\nimpossible, we would manifestly have no interaction _in the sense of\\r\\nthe word employed above_.  As it is, the interaction of physical things\\r\\nis something that we can describe with a good deal of definiteness.\\r\\nThings interact in that they stand in certain physical relations, and\\r\\nundergo changes of relations according to certain laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, to one who conceives the mind in a grossly material way, the\\r\\nrelation of mind and body can scarcely seem to be a peculiar problem,\\r\\ndifferent from the problem of the relation of one physical thing to\\r\\nanother.  If my mind consists of atoms disseminated through my body,\\r\\nits presence in the body appears as unequivocal as the presence of a\\r\\ndinner in a man who has just risen from the table.  Nor can the\\r\\ninteraction of mind and matter present any unusual difficulties, for\\r\\nmind is matter.  Atoms may be conceived to approach each other, to\\r\\nclash, to rearrange themselves.  Interaction of mind and body is\\r\\nnothing else than an interaction of bodies.  One is not forced to give\\r\\na new meaning to the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, however, one begins to think of the mind as immaterial, the case\\r\\nis very different.  How shall we conceive an immaterial thing to be\\r\\nrelated to a material one?\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes placed the mind in the pineal gland, and in so far he seemed\\r\\nto make its relation to the gland similar to that between two material\\r\\nthings.  When he tells us that the soul brings it about that the gland\\r\\nbends in different directions, we incline to view the occurrence as\\r\\nvery natural--is not the soul in the gland?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, on the other hand, Descartes also taught that the essence of mind\\r\\nis _thought_ and the essence of body is _extension_.  He made the two\\r\\nnatures so different from each other that men began to ask themselves\\r\\nhow the two things could interact at all.  The mind wills, said one\\r\\nphilosopher, but that volition does not set matter in motion; when the\\r\\nmind wills, God brings about the appropriate change in material things.\\r\\nThe mind perceives things, said another, but that is not because they\\r\\naffect it directly; it sees things in God.  Ideas and things, said a\\r\\nthird, constitute two independent series; no idea can cause a change in\\r\\nthings, and no thing can cause a change in ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interactionist is a man who refuses to take any such turn as these\\r\\nphilosophers.  His doctrine is much nearer to that of Descartes than it\\r\\nis to any of theirs.  He uses the one word \"interaction\" to describe\\r\\nthe relation between material things and also the relation between mind\\r\\nand body, nor does he dwell upon the difference between the two.  He\\r\\ninsists that mind and matter stand in the one causal nexus; that a\\r\\nchange in the outside world may be the _cause_ of a perception coming\\r\\ninto being in a mind, and that a volition may be the _cause_ of changes\\r\\nin matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall we call the plain man?  I think we may call him an\\r\\ninteractionist in embryo.  The stick in his hand knocks an apple off of\\r\\nthe tree; his hand seems to him to be set in motion because he wills\\r\\nit.  The relation between his volition and the motion of his hand\\r\\nappears to him to be of much the same sort as that between the motion\\r\\nof the stick and the fall of the apple.  In each case he thinks he has\\r\\nto do with the relation of cause and effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opponent of the interactionist insists, however, that the plain man\\r\\nis satisfied with this view of the matter only because he has not\\r\\ncompletely stripped off the tendency to conceive the mind as a material\\r\\nthing.  And he accuses the interactionist of having fallen a prey to\\r\\nthe same weakness.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, it is not difficult to show that the interactionists write\\r\\nas though the mind were material, and could be somewhere in space.  The\\r\\nlate Dr. McCosh fairly represents the thought of many, and he was\\r\\ncapable of expressing himself as follows;[1] \"It may be difficult to\\r\\nascertain the exact point or surface at which the mind and body come\\r\\ntogether and influence each other, in particular, how far into the body\\r\\n(Descartes without proof thought it to be in the pineal gland), but it\\r\\nis certain, that when they do meet mind knows body as having its\\r\\nessential properties of extension and resisting energy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can an immaterial thing be located at some point or surface within\\r\\nthe body?  How can a material thing and an immaterial thing \"come\\r\\ntogether\" at a point or surface?  And if they cannot come together,\\r\\nwhat have we in mind when we say they interact?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallelist, for it is he who opposes interactionism, insists that\\r\\nwe must not forget that mental phenomena do not belong to the same\\r\\norder as physical phenomena.  He points out that, when we make the word\\r\\n\"interaction\" cover the relations of mental phenomena to physical\\r\\nphenomena as well as the relations of the latter to each other, we are\\r\\nassimilating heedlessly facts of two different kinds and are\\r\\nobliterating an important distinction.  He makes the same objection to\\r\\ncalling the relations between mental phenomena and physical phenomena\\r\\n_causal_.  If the relation of a volition to the movement of the arm is\\r\\nnot the same as that of a physical cause to its physical effect, why,\\r\\nhe argues, do you disguise the difference by calling them by the same\\r\\nname?\\r\\n\\r\\n37. THE DOCTRINE OF THE PARALLELIST.--Thus, the parallelist is a man\\r\\nwho is so impressed by the gulf between physical facts and mental facts\\r\\nthat he refuses to regard them as parts of the one order of causes and\\r\\neffects.  You cannot, he claims, make a single chain out of links so\\r\\ndiverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome part of a human body receives a blow; a message is carried along a\\r\\nsensory nerve and reaches the brain; from the brain a message is sent\\r\\nout along a motor nerve to a group of muscles; the muscles contract,\\r\\nand a limb is set in motion.  The immediate effects of the blow, the\\r\\ningoing message, the changes in the brain, the outgoing message, the\\r\\ncontraction of the muscles--all these are physical facts.  One and all\\r\\nmay be described as motions in matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man who received the blow becomes conscious that he was struck,\\r\\nand both interactionist and parallelist regard him as becoming\\r\\nconscious of it when the incoming message reaches some part of the\\r\\nbrain.  What shall be done with this consciousness?  The interactionist\\r\\ninsists that it must be regarded as a link in the physical chain of\\r\\ncauses and effects--he breaks the chain to insert it.  The parallelist\\r\\nmaintains that it is inconceivable that such an insertion should be\\r\\nmade.  He regards the physical series as complete in itself, and he\\r\\nplaces the consciousness, as it were, on a _parallel_ line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must not be supposed that he takes this figure literally.  It is his\\r\\neffort to avoid materializing the mind that forces him to hold the\\r\\nposition which he does.  To put the mind in the brain is to make of it\\r\\na material thing; to make it parallel to the brain, in the literal\\r\\nsense of the word, would be just as bad.  All that we may understand\\r\\nhim to mean is that mental phenomena and physical, although they are\\r\\nrelated, cannot be built into the one series of causes and effects.  He\\r\\nis apt to speak of them as _concomitant_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not forget that neither parallelist nor interactionist ever\\r\\ndreams of repudiating our common experiences of the relations of mental\\r\\nphenomena and physical.  Neither one will, if he is a man of sense,\\r\\nabandon the usual ways of describing such experiences.  Whatever his\\r\\ntheory, he will still say: I am suffering because I struck my hand\\r\\nagainst that table; I sat down because I chose to do so.  His doctrine\\r\\nis not supposed to deny the truth contained in such statements; it is\\r\\nsupposed only to give a fuller understanding of it.  Hence, we cannot\\r\\ncondemn either doctrine simply by an uncritical appeal to such\\r\\nstatements and to the experiences they represent.  We must look much\\r\\ndeeper.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what can the parallelist mean by _referring_ sensations and ideas\\r\\nto the brain and yet denying that they are _in_ the brain?  What is\\r\\nthis reference?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us come back to the experiences of the physical and the mental as\\r\\nthey present themselves to the plain man.  They have been discussed at\\r\\nlength in Chapter IV.  It was there pointed out that every one\\r\\ndistinguishes without difficulty between sensations and things, and\\r\\nthat every one recognizes explicitly or implicitly that a sensation is\\r\\nan experience referred in a certain way to the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the eyes are open, we _see_; when the ears are open, we _hear_;\\r\\nwhen the hand is laid on things, we _feel_.  How do we know that we are\\r\\nexperiencing sensations?  The setting tells us that.  The experience in\\r\\nquestion is given together with an experience of the body.  This is\\r\\n_concomitance of the mental and the physical_ as it appears in the\\r\\nexperience of us all; and from such experiences as these the\\r\\nphilosopher who speaks of the concomitance of physical and mental\\r\\nphenomena must draw the whole meaning of the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us here sharpen a little the distinction between sensations and\\r\\nthings.  Standing at some distance from the tree, I see an apple fall\\r\\nto the ground.  Were I only half as far away, my experience would not\\r\\nbe exactly the same--I should have somewhat different sensations.  As\\r\\nwe have seen (section 17), the apparent sizes of things vary as we\\r\\nmove, and this means that the quantity of sensation, when I observe the\\r\\napple from a nearer point, is greater.  The man of science tells me\\r\\nthat the image which the object looked at projects upon the retina of\\r\\nthe eye grows larger as we approach objects.  The thing, then, may\\r\\nremain unchanged; our sensations will vary according to the impression\\r\\nwhich is made upon our body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  When I have learned something of physics, I am ready to admit\\r\\nthat, although light travels with almost inconceivable rapidity, still,\\r\\nits journey through space does take time.  Hence the impression made\\r\\nupon my eye by the falling apple is not simultaneous with the fall\\r\\nitself; and if I stand far away it is made a little later than when I\\r\\nam near.  In the case in point the difference is so slight as to pass\\r\\nunnoticed, but there are cases in which it seems apparent even to the\\r\\nunlearned that sensations arise later than the occurrences of which we\\r\\ntake them to be the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, I stand on a hill and watch a laborer striking with his sledge\\r\\nupon the distant railway.  I hear the sound of the blow while I see his\\r\\ntool raised above his head.  I account for this by saying that it has\\r\\ntaken some time for the sound-waves to reach my ear, and I regard my\\r\\nsensation as arising only when this has been accomplished.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this conclusion is not judged sufficiently accurate by the man of\\r\\nscience.  The investigations of the physiologist and the psychologist\\r\\nhave revealed that the brain holds a peculiar place in the economy of\\r\\nthe body.  If the nerve which connects the sense organ with the brain\\r\\nbe severed, the sensation does not arise.  Injuries to the brain affect\\r\\nthe mental life as injuries to other parts of the body do not.  Hence,\\r\\nit is concluded that, to get the real time of the emergence of a\\r\\nsensation, we must not inquire merely when an impression was made upon\\r\\nthe organ of sense, but must determine when the message sent along the\\r\\nnerve has reached some part of the brain.  The resulting brain change\\r\\nis regarded as the true concomitant of the sensation.  If there is a\\r\\nbrain change of a certain kind, there is the corresponding sensation.\\r\\nIt need hardly be said that no one knows as yet much about the brain\\r\\nmotions which are supposed to be concomitants of sensations, although a\\r\\ngood deal is said about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very important to remark that in all this no new meaning has been\\r\\ngiven to the word \"concomitance.\"  The plain man remarks that\\r\\nsensations and their changes must be referred to the body.  With the\\r\\nbody disposed in a certain way, he has sensations of a certain kind;\\r\\nwith changes in the body, the sensations change.  He does not perceive\\r\\nthe sensations to be in the body.  As I recede from a house I have a\\r\\nwhole series of visual experiences differing from each other and ending\\r\\nin a faint speck which bears little resemblance to the experience with\\r\\nwhich I started.  I have had, as we say, a series of sensations, or\\r\\ngroups of such.  Did any single group, did the experience which I had\\r\\nat any single moment, seem to me to be _in my body_?  Surely not.  Its\\r\\nrelation to my body is other than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the man of science, instead of referring sensations vaguely to\\r\\nthe body, refers them to the brain, the reference is of precisely the\\r\\nsame nature.  From our common experience of the relation of the\\r\\nphysical and the mental he starts out.  He has no other ground on which\\r\\nto stand.  He can only mark the reference with greater exactitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been speaking of the relation of sensations to the brain.  It is\\r\\nscarcely necessary for me to show that all other mental phenomena must\\r\\nbe referred to the brain as well, and that the reference must be of the\\r\\nsame nature.  The considerations which lead us to refer ideas to the\\r\\nbrain are set forth in our physiologies and psychologies.  The effects\\r\\nof cerebral disease, injuries to the brain, etc., are too well known to\\r\\nneed mention; and it is palpably as absurd to put ideas in the brain as\\r\\nit is to put sensations there.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the parallelist, if he be a wise man, will not attempt to\\r\\n_explain_ the reference of mental phenomena to the brain--to _explain_\\r\\nthe relation between mind and matter.  The relation appears to be\\r\\nunique.  Certainly it is not identical with the relation between two\\r\\nmaterial things.  We explain things, in the common acceptation of the\\r\\nword, when we show that a case under consideration is an\\r\\nexemplification of some general law--when we show, in other words, that\\r\\nit does not stand alone.  But this does stand alone, and is admitted to\\r\\nstand alone.  We admit as much when we say that the mind is immaterial,\\r\\nand yet hold that it is related to the body.  We cannot, then, ask for\\r\\nan _explanation_ of the relation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this does not mean that the reference of mental phenomena to the\\r\\nbody is a meaningless expression.  We can point to those experiences of\\r\\nconcomitance that we all have, distinguish them carefully from\\r\\nrelations of another kind, and say: This is what the word means,\\r\\nwhether it be used by the plain man or by the man of science.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said above: \"If there is a brain change of a certain kind, there\\r\\nis the corresponding sensation.\"  Perhaps the reader will feel inclined\\r\\nto say here: If you can say as much as this, why can you not go a\\r\\nlittle farther and call the brain change the _cause_ of the sensation?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he who speaks thus, forgets what has been said above about the\\r\\nuniqueness of the relation.  In the objective order of our experiences,\\r\\nin the external world, we can distinguish between antecedents and\\r\\nconsequents, between causes and their effects.  The causes and their\\r\\neffects belong to the one order, they stand in the same series.  The\\r\\nrelation of the physical to the mental is, as we have seen, a different\\r\\nrelation.  Hence, the parallelist seems justified in objecting to the\\r\\nassimilation of the two.  He prefers the word \"concomitance,\" just\\r\\nbecause it marks the difference.  He does not mean to indicate that the\\r\\nrelation is any the less uniform or dependable when he denies that it\\r\\nis causal.\\r\\n\\r\\n38. IN WHAT SENSE MENTAL PHENOMENA HAVE A TIME AND PLACE.--We have seen\\r\\nin Chapters VI and VII what space and time--real space and time--are.\\r\\nThey are the plan of the real external world and its changes; they are\\r\\naspects of the objective order of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this order no mental phenomenon can belong.  It cannot, as we have\\r\\nseen (section 35), occupy any portion of space or even have a location\\r\\nin space.  It is equally true that no series of mental changes can\\r\\noccupy any portion of time, real time, or even fill a single moment in\\r\\nthe stream of time.  There are many persons to whom this latter\\r\\nstatement will seem difficult of acceptance; but the relation of mental\\r\\nphenomena to space and to time is of the same sort, and we can consider\\r\\nthe two together.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychologists speak unhesitatingly of the localization of sensations in\\r\\nthe brain, and they talk as readily of the moment at which a sensation\\r\\narises and of the duration of the sensation.  What can they mean by\\r\\nsuch expressions?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that sensations are not in the brain, and their\\r\\nlocalization means only the determination of their concomitant physical\\r\\nphenomena, of the corresponding brain-change.  And it ought to be clear\\r\\neven from what has been said above that, in determining the moment at\\r\\nwhich a sensation arises, we are determining only the time of the\\r\\nconcomitant brain process.  Why do we say that a sensation arises later\\r\\nthan the moment at which an impression is made upon the organ of sense\\r\\nand earlier than the resulting movement of some group of muscles?\\r\\nBecause the change in the brain, to which we refer the sensation,\\r\\noccurs later than the one and earlier than the other.  This has a place\\r\\nin real time, it belongs to that series of world changes whose\\r\\nsuccession constitutes real time.  If we ask _when_ anything happened,\\r\\nwe always refer to this series of changes.  We try to determine its\\r\\nplace in the world order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we ask: When was Julius Caesar born?  We are given a year and a\\r\\nday.  How is the time which has elapsed since measured?  By changes in\\r\\nthe physical world, by revolutions of the earth about the sun.  We ask:\\r\\nWhen did he conceive the plan of writing his Commentaries?  If we get\\r\\nan answer at all, it must be an answer of the same kind--some point in\\r\\nthe series of physical changes which occur in real time must be\\r\\nindicated.  Where else should we look for an answer?  In point of fact,\\r\\nwe never do look elsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  We have distinguished between apparent space and real space\\r\\n(section 34).  We have seen that, when we deny that a mental image can\\r\\noccupy any portion of space, we need not think of it as losing its\\r\\nparts and shrivelling to a point.  We may still attribute to it\\r\\napparent space; may affirm that it seems extended.  Let us mark the\\r\\nsame distinction when we consider time.  The psychologist speaks of the\\r\\nduration of a sensation.  Has it real duration?  It is not in time at\\r\\nall, and, of course, it cannot, strictly speaking, occupy a portion of\\r\\ntime.  But we can try to measure the duration of the physical\\r\\nconcomitant, and call this the real duration of the sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all distinguish between the real time of mental phenomena, in the\\r\\nsense indicated just above, and the apparent time.  We know very well\\r\\nthat the one may give us no true measure of the other.  A sermon\\r\\n_seems_ long; was it _really_ long?  There is only one way of measuring\\r\\nits real length.  We must refer to the clock, to the sun, to some\\r\\nchange in the physical world.  We _seem_ to live years in a dream; was\\r\\nthe dream _really_ a long one?  The real length can only be determined,\\r\\nif at all, by a physical reference.  Those apparent years of the dream\\r\\nhave no place in the real time which is measured by the clock.  We do\\r\\nnot have to cut it and insert them somewhere.  They belong to a\\r\\ndifferent order, and cannot be inserted any more than the thought of a\\r\\npatch can be inserted in a rent in a real coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see, thus, when we reflect upon the matter, that mental phenomena\\r\\ncannot, strictly speaking, be said to have a time and place.  He who\\r\\nattributes these to them materializes them.  But their physical\\r\\nconcomitants have a time and place, and mental phenomena can be\\r\\nordered by a reference to these.  They can be assigned a time and\\r\\nplace of existing in a special sense of the words not to be confounded\\r\\nwith the sense in which we use them when we speak of the time and place\\r\\nof material things.  This makes it possible to relate every mental\\r\\nphenomenon to the world system in a definite way, and to distinguish it\\r\\nclearly from every other, however similar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need not, when we come to understand this, change our usual modes of\\r\\nspeech.  We may still say: The pain I had two years ago is like the\\r\\npain I have to-day; my sensation came into being at such a moment; my\\r\\nregret lasted two days.  We speak that we may be understood; and such\\r\\nphrases express a truth, even if they are rather loose and inaccurate.\\r\\nBut we must not be deceived by such phrases, and assume that they mean\\r\\nwhat they have no right to mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n39. OBJECTIONS TO PARALLELISM.--What objections can be brought against\\r\\nparallelism?  It is sometimes objected by the interactionist that it\\r\\nabandons the plain man\\'s notion of the mind as a substance with its\\r\\nattributes, and makes of it a mere collection of mental phenomena.  It\\r\\nmust be admitted that the parallelist usually holds a view which\\r\\ndiffers rather widely from that of the unlearned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even supposing this objection well taken, it can no longer be\\r\\nregarded as an objection specifically to the doctrine of parallelism,\\r\\nfor the view of the mind in question is becoming increasingly popular,\\r\\nand it is now held by influential interactionists as well as by\\r\\nparallelists.  One may believe that the mind consists of ideas, and may\\r\\nstill hold that ideas can cause motions in matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, however, another objection that predisposes many thoughtful\\r\\npersons to reject parallelism uncompromisingly.  It is this.  If we\\r\\nadmit that the chain of physical causes and effects, from a blow given\\r\\nto the body to the resulting muscular movements made in self-defense,\\r\\nis an unbroken one, what part can we assign to the mind in the whole\\r\\ntransaction?  Has it _done_ anything?  Is it not reduced to the\\r\\nposition of a passive spectator?  Must we not regard man as \"a physical\\r\\nautomaton with parallel psychical states\"?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch an account of man cannot fail to strike one as repugnant; and yet\\r\\nit is the parallelist himself whom we must thank for introducing us to\\r\\nit.  The account is not a caricature from the pen of an opponent.  \"An\\r\\nautomaton,\" writes Professor Clifford,[2] \"is a thing that goes by\\r\\nitself when it is wound up, and we go by ourselves when we have had\\r\\nfood.  Excepting the fact that other men are conscious, there is no\\r\\nreason why we should not regard the human body as merely an exceedingly\\r\\ncomplicated machine which is wound up by putting food into the mouth.\\r\\nBut it is not _merely_ a machine, because consciousness goes with it.\\r\\nThe mind, then, is to be regarded as a stream of feelings which runs\\r\\nparallel to, and simultaneous with, a certain part of the action of the\\r\\nbody, that is to say, that particular part of the action of the brain\\r\\nin which the cerebrum and the sensory tracts are excited.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe saving statement that the body is not _merely_ a machine, because\\r\\nconsciousness goes with it, does not impress one as being sufficient to\\r\\nredeem the illustration.  Who wants to be an automaton with an\\r\\naccompanying consciousness?  Who cares to regard his mind as an\\r\\n\"epiphenomenon\"--a thing that exists, but whose existence or\\r\\nnonexistence makes no difference to the course of affairs?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plain man\\'s objection to such an account of himself seems to be\\r\\nabundantly justified.  As I have said earlier in this chapter, neither\\r\\ninteractionist nor parallelist has the intention of repudiating the\\r\\nexperience of world and mind common to us all.  We surely have evidence\\r\\nenough to prove that minds count for something.  No house was ever\\r\\nbuilt, no book was ever written, by a creature without a mind; and the\\r\\nbetter the house or book, the better the mind.  _That_ there is a fixed\\r\\nand absolutely dependable relation between the planning mind and the\\r\\nthing accomplished, no man of any school has the right to deny.  The\\r\\nonly legitimate question is: _What is the nature_ of the relation?  Is\\r\\nit _causal_, or should it be conceived to be _something else_?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole matter will be more fully discussed in Chapter XI.  This\\r\\nchapter I shall close with a brief summary of the points which the\\r\\nreader will do well to bear in mind when he occupies himself with\\r\\nparallelism.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) Parallelism is a protest against the interactionist\\'s tendency to\\r\\nmaterialize the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) The name is a figurative expression, and must not be taken\\r\\nliterally.  The true relation between mental phenomena and physical is\\r\\ngiven in certain common experiences that have been indicated, and it is\\r\\na unique relation.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) It is a fixed and absolutely dependable relation.  It is impossible\\r\\nthat there should be a particular mental fact without its corresponding\\r\\nphysical fact; and it is impossible that this physical fact should\\r\\noccur without its corresponding mental fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) The parallelist objects to calling this relation _causal_, because\\r\\nthis obscures the distinction between it and the relation between facts\\r\\nboth of which are physical.  He prefers the word \"concomitance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) Such objections to parallelism as that cited above assume that the\\r\\nconcomitance of which the parallelist speaks is analogous to physical\\r\\nconcomitance.  The chemist puts together a volume of hydrogen gas and a\\r\\nvolume of chlorine gas, and the result is two volumes of hydrochloric\\r\\nacid gas.  We regard it as essential to the result that there should be\\r\\nthe two gases and that they should be brought together.  But the fact\\r\\nthat the chemist has red hair we rightly look upon as a concomitant\\r\\nphenomenon of no importance.  The result would be the same if he had\\r\\nblack hair or were bald.  But this is not the concomitance that\\r\\ninterests the parallelist.  The two sorts of concomitance are alike\\r\\nonly in the one point.  Some phenomenon is regarded as excluded from\\r\\nthe series of causes and effects under discussion.  On the other hand,\\r\\nthe difference between the two is all-important; in the one case, the\\r\\nconcomitant phenomenon is an accidental circumstance that might just as\\r\\nwell be absent; in the other, it is nothing of the sort; it _cannot_ be\\r\\nabsent--the mental fact _must_ exist if the brain-change in question\\r\\nexists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is quite possible that, on reading this list of points, one may be\\r\\ninclined to make two protests.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: Is a parallelism so carefully guarded as this properly called\\r\\n_parallelism_ at all?  To this I answer: The name matters little.  I\\r\\nhave used it because I have no better term.  Certainly, it is not the\\r\\nparallelism which is sometimes brought forward, and which peeps out\\r\\nfrom the citation from Clifford.  It is nothing more than an insistence\\r\\nupon the truth that we should not treat the mind as though it were a\\r\\nmaterial thing.  If any one wishes to take the doctrine and discard the\\r\\nname, I have no objection.  As so guarded, the doctrine is, I think,\\r\\ntrue.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: If it is desirable to avoid the word \"cause,\" in speaking of\\r\\nthe relation of the mental and the physical, on the ground that\\r\\notherwise we give the word a double sense, why is it not desirable to\\r\\navoid the word \"concomitance\"?  Have we not seen that the word is\\r\\nambiguous?  I admit the inconsistency and plead in excuse only that I\\r\\nhave chosen the lesser of two evils.  It is fatally easy to slip into\\r\\nthe error of thinking of the mind as though it were material and had a\\r\\nplace in the physical world.  In using the word \"concomitance\" I enter\\r\\na protest against this.  But I have, of course, no right to use it\\r\\nwithout showing just what kind of concomitance I mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"First and Fundamental Truths,\" Book I, Part II, Chapter II.  New\\r\\nYork, 1889.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] \"Lectures and Essays,\" Vol. II, p. 57.  London, 1879.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nHOW WE KNOW THERE ARE OTHER MINDS\\r\\n\\r\\n40. IS IT CERTAIN THAT WE KNOW IT?--I suppose there is no man in his\\r\\nsober senses who seriously believes that no other mind than his own\\r\\nexists.  There is, to be sure, an imaginary being more or less\\r\\ndiscussed by those interested in philosophy, a creature called the\\r\\nSolipsist, who is credited with this doctrine.  But men do not become\\r\\nsolipsists, though they certainly say things now and then that other\\r\\nmen think logically lead to some such unnatural view of things; and\\r\\nmore rarely they say things that sound as if the speaker, in some\\r\\nmoods, at least, might actually harbor such a view.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the philosopher Fichte (1762-1814) talks in certain of his\\r\\nwritings as though he believed himself to be the universe, and his\\r\\nwords cause Jean Paul Richter, the inimitable, to break out in his\\r\\ncharacteristic way: \"The very worst of it all is the lazy, aimless,\\r\\naristocratic, insular life that a god must lead; he has no one to go\\r\\nwith.  If I am not to sit still for all time and eternity, if I let\\r\\nmyself down as well as I can and make myself finite, that I may have\\r\\nsomething in the way of society, still I have, like petty princes, only\\r\\nmy own creatures to echo my words. . . .  Every being, even the highest\\r\\nBeing, wishes something to love and to honor.  But the Fichtean\\r\\ndoctrine that I am my own body-maker leaves me with nothing\\r\\nwhatever--with not so much as the beggar\\'s dog or the prisoner\\'s\\r\\nspider. . . .  Truly I wish that there were men, and that I were one of\\r\\nthem. . . .  If there exists, as I very much fear, no one but myself,\\r\\nunlucky dog that I am, then there is no one at such a pass as I.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJust how much Fichte\\'s words meant to the man who wrote them may be a\\r\\nmatter for dispute.  Certainly no one has shown a greater moral\\r\\nearnestness or a greater regard for his fellowmen than this\\r\\nphilosopher, and we must not hastily accuse any one of being a\\r\\nsolipsist.  But that to certain men, and, indeed, to many men, there\\r\\nhave come thoughts that have seemed to point in this direction--that\\r\\nnot a few have had doubts as to their ability to _prove_ the existence\\r\\nof other minds--this we must admit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears somewhat easier for a man to have doubts upon this subject\\r\\nwhen he has fallen into the idealistic error of regarding the material\\r\\nworld, which seems to be revealed to him, as nothing else than his\\r\\n\"ideas\" or \"sensations\" or \"impressions.\"  If we will draw the whole\\r\\n\"telephone exchange\" into the clerk, there seems little reason for not\\r\\nincluding all the subscribers as well.  If other men\\'s bodies are my\\r\\nsensations, may not other men\\'s minds be my imaginings?  But doubts may\\r\\nbe felt also by those who are willing to admit a real external world.\\r\\nHow do we know that our inference to the existence of other minds is a\\r\\njustifiable inference?  Can there be such a thing as _verification_ in\\r\\nthis field?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor we must remember that no man is directly conscious of any mind\\r\\nexcept his own.  Men cannot exhibit their minds to their neighbors as\\r\\nthey exhibit their wigs.  However close may seem to us to be our\\r\\nintercourse with those about us, do we ever attain to anything more\\r\\nthan our ideas of the contents of their minds?  We do not experience\\r\\nthese contents; we picture them, we represent them by certain proxies.\\r\\nTo be sure, we believe that the originals exist, but can we be quite\\r\\nsure of it?  Can there be a _proof_ of this right to make the leap from\\r\\none consciousness to another?  We seem to assume that we can make it,\\r\\nand then we make it again and again; but suppose, after all, that there\\r\\nwere nothing there.  Could we ever find out our error?  And in a field\\r\\nwhere it is impossible to prove error, must it not be equally\\r\\nimpossible to prove truth?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doubt has seemed by no means a gratuitous one to certain very\\r\\nsensible practical men.  \"It is wholly impossible,\" writes Professor\\r\\nHuxley,[1] \"absolutely to prove the presence or absence of\\r\\nconsciousness in anything but one\\'s own brain, though by analogy, we\\r\\nare justified in assuming its existence in other men.\"  \"The existence\\r\\nof my conception of you in my consciousness,\" says Clifford,[2]\\r\\n\"carries with it a belief in the existence of you outside of my\\r\\nconsciousness. . . .  How this inference is justified, how\\r\\nconsciousness can testify to the existence of anything outside of\\r\\nitself, I do not pretend to say: I need not untie a knot which the\\r\\nworld has cut for me long ago.  It may very well be that I myself am\\r\\nthe only existence, but it is simply ridiculous to suppose that anybody\\r\\nelse is.  The position of absolute idealism may, therefore, be left out\\r\\nof count, although each individual may be unable to justify his dissent\\r\\nfrom it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are writers belonging to our own modern age, and they are men of\\r\\nscience.  Both of them deny that the existence of other minds is a\\r\\nthing that can be _proved_; but the one tells us that we are \"justified\\r\\nin assuming\" their existence, and the other informs us that, although\\r\\n\"it may very well be\" that no other mind exists, we may leave that\\r\\npossibility out of count.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither position seems a sensible one.  Are we justified in assuming\\r\\nwhat cannot be proved? or is the argument \"from analogy\" really a proof\\r\\nof some sort?  Is it right to close our eyes to what \"may very well\\r\\nbe,\" just because we choose to do so?  The fact is that both of these\\r\\nwriters had the conviction, shared by us all, that there are other\\r\\nminds, and that we know something about them; and yet neither of them\\r\\ncould see that the conviction rested upon an unshakable foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I have no desire to awake in the mind of any one a doubt of the\\r\\nexistence of other minds.  But I think we must all admit that the man\\r\\nwho recognizes that such minds are not directly perceived, and who\\r\\nharbors doubts as to the nature of the inference which leads to their\\r\\nassumption, may, perhaps, be able to say that _he feels certain_ that\\r\\nthere are other minds; but must we not at the same time admit that he\\r\\nis scarcely in a position to say: _it is certain_ that there are other\\r\\nminds?  The question will keep coming back again: May there not, after\\r\\nall, be a legitimate doubt on the subject?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo set this question at rest there seems to be only one way, and that\\r\\nis this: to ascertain the nature of the inference which is made, and to\\r\\nsee clearly what can be meant by _proof_ when one is concerned with\\r\\nsuch matters as these.  If it turns out that we have proof, in the only\\r\\nsense of the word in which it is reasonable to ask for proof, our doubt\\r\\nfalls away of itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n41. THE ARGUMENT FOR OTHER MINDS.--I have said early in this volume\\r\\n(section 7) that the plain man perceives that other men act very much\\r\\nas he does, and that he attributes to them minds more or less like his\\r\\nown.  He reasons from like to like--other bodies present phenomena\\r\\nwhich, in the case of his own body, he perceives to be indicative of\\r\\nmind, and he accepts them as indicative of mind there also.  The\\r\\npsychologist makes constant use of this inference; indeed, he could not\\r\\ndevelop his science without it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806-1873), whom it is always a pleasure to read\\r\\nbecause he is so clear and straightforward, presents this argument in\\r\\nthe following form:[3]--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"By what evidence do I know, or by what considerations am I led to\\r\\nbelieve, that there exist other sentient creatures; that the walking\\r\\nand speaking figures which I see and hear, have sensations and\\r\\nthoughts, or, in other words, possess Minds?  The most strenuous\\r\\nIntuitionist does not include this among the things that I know by\\r\\ndirect intuition.  I conclude it from certain things, which my\\r\\nexperience of my own states of feeling proves to me to be marks of it.\\r\\nThese marks are of two kinds, antecedent and subsequent; the previous\\r\\nconditions requisite for feeling, and the effects or consequences of\\r\\nit.  I conclude that other human beings have feelings like me, because,\\r\\nfirst, they have bodies like me, which I know, in my own case, to be\\r\\nthe antecedent condition of feelings; and because, secondly, they\\r\\nexhibit the acts, and other outward signs, which in my own case I know\\r\\nby experience to be caused by feelings.  I am conscious in myself of a\\r\\nseries of facts connected by a uniform sequence, of which the beginning\\r\\nis modifications of my body, the middle is feelings, the end is outward\\r\\ndemeanor.  In the case of other human beings I have the evidence of my\\r\\nsenses for the first and last links of the series, but not for the\\r\\nintermediate link.  I find, however, that the sequence between the\\r\\nfirst and last is as regular and constant in those other cases as it is\\r\\nin mine.  In my own case I know that the first link produces the last\\r\\nthrough the intermediate link, and could not produce it without.\\r\\nExperience, therefore, obliges me to conclude that there must be an\\r\\nintermediate link; which must either be the same in others as in\\r\\nmyself, or a different one.  I must either believe them to be alive, or\\r\\nto be automatons; and by believing them to be alive, that is, by\\r\\nsupposing the link to be of the same nature as in the case of which I\\r\\nhave experience, and which is in all respects similar, I bring other\\r\\nhuman beings, as phenomena, under the same generalizations which I know\\r\\nby experience to be the true theory of my own existence.  And in doing\\r\\nso I conform to the legitimate rules of experimental inquiry.  The\\r\\nprocess is exactly parallel to that by which Newton proved that the\\r\\nforce which keeps the planets in their orbits is identical with that by\\r\\nwhich an apple falls to the ground.  It was not incumbent on Newton to\\r\\nprove the impossibility of its being any other force; he was thought to\\r\\nhave made out his point when he had simply shown that no other force\\r\\nneed be supposed.  We know the existence of other beings by\\r\\ngeneralization from the knowledge of our own; the generalization merely\\r\\npostulates that what experience shows to be a mark of the existence of\\r\\nsomething within the sphere of our consciousness, may be concluded to\\r\\nbe a mark of the same thing beyond that sphere.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the plain man accepts the argument from analogy, here insisted\\r\\nupon, every day of his life.  He is continually forming an opinion as\\r\\nto the contents of other minds on a basis of the bodily manifestations\\r\\npresented to his view.  The process of inference is so natural and\\r\\ninstinctive that we are tempted to say that it hardly deserves to be\\r\\ncalled an inference.  Certainly the man is not conscious of distinct\\r\\nsteps in the process; he perceives certain phenomena, and they are at\\r\\nonce illuminated by their interpretation.  He reads other men as we\\r\\nread a book--the signs on the paper are scarcely attended to, our whole\\r\\nthought is absorbed in that for which they stand.  As I have said\\r\\nabove, the psychologist accepts the argument, and founds his\\r\\nconclusions upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon what ground can one urge that this inference to other minds is a\\r\\ndoubtful one?  It is made universally.  We have seen that even those\\r\\nwho have theoretic objections against it, do not hesitate to draw it,\\r\\nas a matter of fact.  It appears unnatural in the extreme to reject it.\\r\\nWhat can induce men to regard it with suspicion?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the answer to this question is rather clearly suggested in the\\r\\nsentence already quoted from Professor Huxley:  \"It is wholly\\r\\nimpossible absolutely to prove the presence or absence of consciousness\\r\\nin anything but one\\'s own brain, though, by analogy, we are justified\\r\\nin assuming its existence in other men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere Professor Huxley admits that we have something like a proof, for\\r\\nhe regards the inference as _justified_.  But he does not think that we\\r\\nhave _absolute proof_--the best that we can attain to appears to be a\\r\\ndegree of probability falling short of the certainty which we should\\r\\nlike to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it should be remarked that the discredit cast upon the argument\\r\\nfor other minds has its source in the fact that it does not satisfy a\\r\\ncertain assumed standard.  What is that standard?  It is the standard\\r\\nof proof which we may look for and do look for where we are concerned\\r\\nto establish the existence of material things with the highest degree\\r\\nof certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are all sorts of indirect ways of proving the existence of\\r\\nmaterial things.  We may read about them in a newspaper, and regard\\r\\nthem as highly doubtful; we may have the word of a man whom, on the\\r\\nwhole, we regard as veracious; we may infer their existence, because we\\r\\nperceive that certain other things exist, and are to be accounted for.\\r\\nUnder certain circumstances, however, we may have proof of a different\\r\\nkind: we may see and touch the things themselves.  Material things are\\r\\nopen to direct inspection.  Such a direct inspection constitutes\\r\\n_absolute proof_, so far as material things are concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have no right to set this up as our standard of absolute proof,\\r\\nwhen we are talking about other minds.  In this field it is not proof\\r\\nat all.  Anything that can be directly inspected is not another mind.\\r\\nWe cannot cast a doubt upon the existence of colors by pointing to the\\r\\nfact that we cannot smell them.  If they could be smelt, they would not\\r\\nbe colors.  We must in each case seek a proof of the appropriate kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat have we a right to regard as absolute proof of the existence of\\r\\nanother mind?  Only this: the analogy upon which we depend in making\\r\\nour inference must be a very close one.  As we shall see in the next\\r\\nsection, the analogy is sometimes very remote, and we draw the\\r\\ninference with much hesitation, or, perhaps, refuse to draw it at all.\\r\\nIt is not, however, the _kind of inference_ that makes the trouble; it\\r\\nis the lack of detailed information that may serve as a basis for\\r\\ninference.  Our inference to other minds is unsatisfactory only in so\\r\\nfar as we are ignorant of our own minds and bodies and of other bodies.\\r\\nWere our knowledge in these fields complete, we should know without\\r\\nfail the signs of mind, and should know whether an inference were or\\r\\nwere not justified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd _justified_ here means proved--proved in the only sense in which we\\r\\nhave a right to ask for proof.  No single fact is known that can\\r\\ndiscredit such a proof.  Our doubt is, then, gratuitous and can be\\r\\ndismissed.  We may claim that we have _verification_ of the existence\\r\\nof other minds.  Such verification, however, must consist in showing\\r\\nthat, in any given instance, the signs of mind really are present.  It\\r\\ncannot consist in presenting minds for inspection as though they were\\r\\nmaterial things.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne more matter remains to be touched upon in this section.  It has\\r\\ndoubtless been observed that Mill, in the extract given above, seems to\\r\\nplace \"feelings,\" in other words, mental phenomena, between one set of\\r\\nbodily motions and another.  He makes them the middle link in a chain\\r\\nwhose first and third links are material.  The parallelist cannot treat\\r\\nmind in this way.  He claims that to make mental phenomena effects or\\r\\ncauses of bodily motions is to make them material.\\r\\n\\r\\nMust, then, the parallelist abandon the argument for other minds?  Not\\r\\nat all.  The force of the argument lies in interpreting the phenomena\\r\\npresented by other bodies as one knows by experience the phenomena of\\r\\none\\'s own body must be interpreted.  He who concludes that the relation\\r\\nbetween his own mind and his own body can best be described as a\\r\\n\"parallelism,\" must judge that other men\\'s minds are related to their\\r\\nbodies in the same way.  He must treat his neighbor as he treats\\r\\nhimself.  The argument from analogy remains the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n42. WHAT OTHER MINDS ARE THERE?--That other men have minds nobody\\r\\nreally doubts, as we have seen above.  They resemble us so closely,\\r\\ntheir actions are so analogous to our own, that, although we sometimes\\r\\ngive ourselves a good deal of trouble to ascertain what sort of minds\\r\\nthey have, we never think of asking ourselves whether they have minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor does it ever occur to the man who owns a dog, or who drives a\\r\\nhorse, to ask himself whether the creature has a mind.  He may complain\\r\\nthat it has not much of a mind, or he may marvel at its\\r\\nintelligence--his attitude will depend upon the expectations which he\\r\\nhas been led to form.  But regard the animal as he would regard a\\r\\nbicycle or an automobile, he will not.  The brute is not precisely like\\r\\nus, but its actions bear an unmistakable analogy to our own; pleasure\\r\\nand pain, hope and fear, desire and aversion, are so plainly to be read\\r\\ninto them that we feel that a man must be \"high gravel blind\" not to\\r\\nsee their significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, it has been possible for man, under the prepossession of\\r\\na mistaken philosophical theory, to assume the whole brute creation to\\r\\nbe without consciousness.  When Descartes had learned something of the\\r\\nmechanism of the human body, and had placed the human soul--_hospes\\r\\ncomesque corporis_--in the little pineal gland in the midst of the\\r\\nbrain, the conception in his mind was not unlike that which we have\\r\\nwhen we picture to ourselves a locomotive engine with an engineer in\\r\\nits cab.  The man gives intelligent direction; but, under some\\r\\ncircumstances, the machine can do a good deal in the absence of the\\r\\nman; if it is started, it can run of itself, and to do this, it must go\\r\\nthrough a series of complicated motions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes knew that many of the actions performed by the human body are\\r\\nnot the result of conscious choice, and that some of them are in direct\\r\\ncontravention of the will\\'s commands.  The eye protects itself by\\r\\ndropping its lid, when the hand is brought suddenly before it; the foot\\r\\njerks away from the heated object which it has accidentally touched.\\r\\nThe body was seen to be a mechanism relatively independent of the mind,\\r\\nand one rather complete in itself.  Joined with a soul, the circle of\\r\\nits functions was conceived to be widened; but even without the\\r\\nassistance of the soul, it was thought that it could keep itself busy,\\r\\nand could do many things that the unreflective might be inclined to\\r\\nattribute to the efficiency of the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bodies of the brutes Descartes regarded as mechanisms of the same\\r\\ngeneral nature as the human body.  He was unwilling to allow a soul to\\r\\nany creature below man, so nothing seemed left to him save to maintain\\r\\nthat the brutes are machines without consciousness, and that their\\r\\napparently purposive actions are to be classed with such human\\r\\nmovements as the sudden closing of the eye when it is threatened with\\r\\nthe hand.  The melancholy results of this doctrine made themselves\\r\\nevident among his followers.  Even the mild and pious Malebranche could\\r\\nbe brutal to a dog which fawned upon him, under the mistaken notion\\r\\nthat it did not really hurt a dog to kick it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this reasoning men have long ago set aside.  For one thing, it has\\r\\ncome to be recognized that there may be consciousness, perhaps rather\\r\\ndim, blind, and fugitive, but still consciousness, which does not get\\r\\nitself recognized as do our clearly conscious purposes and volitions.\\r\\nMany of the actions of man which Descartes was inclined to regard as\\r\\nunaccompanied by consciousness may not, in fact, be really unconscious.\\r\\nAnd, in the second place, it has come to be realized that we have no\\r\\nright to class all the actions of the brutes with those reflex actions\\r\\nin man which we are accustomed to regard as automatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe belief in animal automatism has passed away, it is to be hoped,\\r\\nnever to return.  That lower animals have minds we must believe.  But\\r\\nwhat sort of minds have they?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard enough to gain an accurate notion of what is going on in a\\r\\nhuman mind.  Men resemble each other more or less closely, but no two\\r\\nare precisely alike, and no two have had exactly the same training.  I\\r\\nmay misunderstand even the man who lives in the same house with me and\\r\\nis nearly related to me.  Does he really suffer and enjoy as acutely as\\r\\nhe seems to? or must his words and actions be accepted with a discount?\\r\\nThe greater the difference between us, the more danger that I shall\\r\\nmisjudge him.  It is to be expected that men should misunderstand\\r\\nwomen; that men and women should misunderstand children; that those who\\r\\ndiffer in social station, in education, in traditions and habits of\\r\\nlife, should be in danger of reading each other as one reads a book in\\r\\na tongue imperfectly mastered.  When these differences are very great,\\r\\nthe task is an extremely difficult one.  What are the emotions, if he\\r\\nhas any, of the Chinaman in the laundry near by?  His face seems as\\r\\ndifficult of interpretation as are the hieroglyphics that he has pasted\\r\\nup on his window.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we come to the brutes, the case is distinctly worse.  We think\\r\\nthat we can attain to some notion of the minds to be attributed to such\\r\\nanimals as the ape, the dog, the cat, the horse, and it is not nonsense\\r\\nto speak of an animal psychology.  But who will undertake to tell us\\r\\nanything definite of the mind of a fly, a grasshopper, a snail, or a\\r\\ncuttlefish?  That they have minds, or something like minds, we must\\r\\nbelieve; what their minds are like, a prudent man scarcely even\\r\\nattempts to say.  In our distribution of minds may we stop short of\\r\\neven the very lowest animal organisms?  It seems arbitrary to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than that; some thoughtful men have been led by the analogy\\r\\nbetween plant life and animal life to believe that something more or\\r\\nless remotely like the consciousness which we attribute to animals must\\r\\nbe attributed also to plants.  Upon this belief I shall not dwell, for\\r\\nhere we are evidently at the limit of our knowledge, and are making the\\r\\nvaguest of guesses.  No one pretends that we have even the beginnings\\r\\nof a plant psychology.  At the same time, we must admit that organisms\\r\\nof all sorts do bear some analogy to each other, even if it be a remote\\r\\none; and we must admit also that we cannot _prove_ plants to be wholly\\r\\ndevoid of a rudimentary consciousness of some sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we begin with man and descend the scale of beings, we seem, in the\\r\\nupper part of the series, to be in no doubt that minds exist.  Our only\\r\\nquestion is as to the precise contents of those minds.  Further down we\\r\\nbegin to ask ourselves whether anything like mind is revealed at all.\\r\\nThat this should be so is to be expected.  Our argument for other minds\\r\\nis the argument from analogy, and as we move down the scale our analogy\\r\\ngrows more and more remote until it seems to fade out altogether.  He\\r\\nwho harbors doubts as to whether the plants enjoy some sort of psychic\\r\\nlife, may well find those doubts intensified when he turns to study the\\r\\ncrystal; and when he contemplates inorganic matter he should admit that\\r\\nthe thread of his argument has become so attenuated that he cannot find\\r\\nit at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n43. THE DOCTRINE OF MIND-STUFF.--Nevertheless, there have been those\\r\\nwho have attributed something like consciousness even to inorganic\\r\\nmatter.  If the doctrine of evolution be true, argues Professor\\r\\nClifford,[4] \"we shall have along the line of the human pedigree a\\r\\nseries of imperceptible steps connecting inorganic matter with\\r\\nourselves.  To the later members of that series we must undoubtedly\\r\\nascribe consciousness, although it must, of course, have been simpler\\r\\nthan our own.  But where are we to stop?  In the case of organisms of a\\r\\ncertain complexity, consciousness is inferred.  As we go back along the\\r\\nline, the complexity of the organism and of its nerve-action insensibly\\r\\ndiminishes; and for the first part of our course we see reason to think\\r\\nthat the complexity of consciousness insensibly diminishes also.  But\\r\\nif we make a jump, say to the tunicate mollusks, we see no reason there\\r\\nto infer the existence of consciousness at all.  Yet not only is it\\r\\nimpossible to point out a place where any sudden break takes place, but\\r\\nit is contrary to all the natural training of our minds to suppose a\\r\\nbreach of continuity so great.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not, says Clifford, admit any breach of continuity.  We must\\r\\nassume that consciousness is a complex of elementary feelings, \"or\\r\\nrather of those remoter elements which cannot even be felt, but of\\r\\nwhich the simplest feeling is built up.\"  We must assume that such\\r\\nelementary facts go along with the action of every organism, however\\r\\nsimple; but we must assume also that it is only when the organism has\\r\\nreached a certain complexity of nervous structure that the complex of\\r\\npsychic facts reaches the degree of complication that we call\\r\\nConsciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much for the assumption of something like mind in the mollusk, where\\r\\nClifford cannot find direct evidence of mind.  But the argument does\\r\\nnot stop here: \"As the line of ascent is unbroken, and must end at last\\r\\nin inorganic matter, we have no choice but to admit that every motion\\r\\nof matter is simultaneous with some . . . fact or event which might be\\r\\npart of a consciousness.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the universal distribution of the elementary constituents of mind\\r\\nClifford writes as follows: \"That element of which, as we have seen,\\r\\neven the simplest feeling is a complex, I shall call _Mind-stuff_.  A\\r\\nmoving molecule of inorganic matter does not possess mind or\\r\\nconsciousness; but it possesses a small piece of mind-stuff.  When\\r\\nmolecules are so combined together as to form the film on the under\\r\\nside of a jellyfish, the elements of mind-stuff which go along with\\r\\nthem are so combined as to form the faint beginnings of Sentience.\\r\\nWhen the molecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous\\r\\nsystem of a vertebrate, the corresponding elements of mind-stuff are so\\r\\ncombined as to form some kind of consciousness; that is to say, changes\\r\\nin the complex which take place at the same time get so linked together\\r\\nthat the repetition of one implies the repetition of the other.  When\\r\\nmatter takes the complex form of a living human brain, the\\r\\ncorresponding mind-stuff takes the form of a human consciousness,\\r\\nhaving intelligence and volition.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the famous mind-stuff doctrine.  It is not a scientific\\r\\ndoctrine, for it rests on wholly unproved assumptions.  It is a play of\\r\\nthe speculative fancy, and has its source in the author\\'s strong desire\\r\\nto fit mental phenomena into some general evolutionary scheme.  As he\\r\\nis a parallelist, and cannot make of physical phenomena and of mental\\r\\none single series of causes and effects, he must attain his end by\\r\\nmaking the mental series complete and independent in itself.  To do\\r\\nthis, he is forced to make several very startling assumptions:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) We have seen that there is evidence that there is consciousness\\r\\nsomewhere--it is revealed by certain bodies.  Clifford assumes\\r\\nconsciousness, or rather its raw material, _mind-stuff_, to be\\r\\neverywhere.  For this assumption we have not a whit of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) To make of the stuff thus attained a satisfactory evolutionary\\r\\nseries, he is compelled to assume that mental phenomena are related to\\r\\neach other much as physical phenomena are related to each other.  This\\r\\nnotion he had from Spinoza, who held that, just as all that takes place\\r\\nin the physical world must be accounted for by a reference to physical\\r\\ncauses, so all happenings in the world of ideas must be accounted for\\r\\nby a reference to mental causes, _i.e._ to ideas.  For this assumption\\r\\nthere is no more evidence than for the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) Finally, to bring the mental phenomena we are familiar with,\\r\\nsensations of color, sound, touch, taste, etc., into this evolutionary\\r\\nscheme, he is forced to assume that all such mental phenomena are made\\r\\nup of elements which do not belong to these classes at all, of\\r\\nsomething that \"cannot even be felt.\"  For this assumption there is as\\r\\nlittle evidence as there is for the other two.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that the _mind-stuff_ doctrine is a castle in the air.  It\\r\\nis too fanciful and arbitrary to take seriously.  It is much better to\\r\\ncome back to a more sober view of things, and to hold that there is\\r\\nevidence that other minds exist, but no evidence that every material\\r\\nthing is animated.  If we cannot fit this into our evolutionary scheme,\\r\\nperhaps it is well to reexamine our evolutionary scheme, and to see\\r\\nwhether some misconception may not attach to that.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Collected Essays,\" Vol. I, p. 219, New York, 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] \"On the Nature of Things-in-Themselves,\" in \"Lectures and Essays,\"\\r\\nVol. II.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] \"Examination of Sir William Hamilton\\'s Philosophy,\" Chapter XII.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] \"On the Nature of Things-in-Themselves.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nOTHER PROBLEMS OF WORLD AND MIND\\r\\n\\r\\n44. IS THE MATERIAL WORLD A MECHANISM?--So far we have concerned\\r\\nourselves with certain leading problems touching the external world and\\r\\nthe mind,--problems which seem to present themselves unavoidably to those\\r\\nwho enter upon the path of reflection.  And we have seen, I hope, that\\r\\nthere is much truth, as well as some misconception, contained in the\\r\\nrather vague opinions of the plain man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the problems that we have taken up by no means exhaust the series of\\r\\nthose that present themselves to one who thinks with patience and\\r\\npersistency.  When we have decided that men are not mistaken in believing\\r\\nthat an external world is presented in their experience; when we have\\r\\ncorrected our first crude notions of what this world is, and have cleared\\r\\naway some confusions from our conceptions of space and time; when we have\\r\\nattained to a reasonably clear view of the nature of the mind, and of the\\r\\nnature of its connection with the body; when we have escaped from a\\r\\ntumble into the absurd doctrine that no mind exists save our own, and\\r\\nhave turned our backs upon the rash speculations of the adherents of\\r\\n\"mind-stuff\"; there still remain many points upon which we should like to\\r\\nhave definite information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the present chapter I shall take up and turn over a few of these, but\\r\\nit must not be supposed that one can get more than a glimpse of them\\r\\nwithin such narrow limits.  First of all we will raise the question\\r\\nwhether it is permissible to regard the material world, which we accept,\\r\\nas through and through a mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be little doubt that there is a tendency on the part of men of\\r\\nscience at the present day so to regard it.  It should, of course, be\\r\\nfrankly admitted that no one is in a position to prove that, from the\\r\\ncosmic mist, in which we grope for the beginnings of our universe, to the\\r\\norganized whole in which vegetable and animal bodies have their place,\\r\\nthere is an unbroken series of changes all of which are explicable by a\\r\\nreference to mechanical laws.  Chemistry, physics, and biology are still\\r\\nseparate and distinct realms, and it is at present impossible to find for\\r\\nthem a common basis in mechanics.  The belief of the man of science must,\\r\\nhence, be regarded as a faith; the doctrine of the mechanism of nature is\\r\\na working hypothesis, and it is unscientific to assume that it is\\r\\nanything more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no objection to a frank admission that we are not here\\r\\nwalking in the light of established knowledge.  But it does seem to savor\\r\\nof dogmatism for a man to insist that no increase in our knowledge can\\r\\never reveal that the physical world is an orderly system throughout, and\\r\\nthat all the changes in material things are explicable in terms of the\\r\\none unified science.  Earnest objections have, however, been made to the\\r\\ntendency to regard nature as a mechanism.  To one of the most curious of\\r\\nthem we have been treated lately by Dr. Ward in his book on \"Naturalism\\r\\nand Agnosticism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is there ingeniously argued that, when we examine with care the\\r\\nfundamental concepts of the science of mechanics, we find them to be\\r\\nself-contradictory and absurd.  It follows that we are not justified in\\r\\nturning to them for an explanation of the order of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe defense of the concepts of mechanics we may safely leave to the man\\r\\nof science; remembering, of course, that, when a science is in the\\r\\nmaking, it is to be expected that the concepts of which it makes use\\r\\nshould undergo revision from time to time.  But there is one general\\r\\nconsideration that it is not well to leave out of view when we are\\r\\ncontemplating such an assault upon the notion of the world as mechanism\\r\\nas is made by Dr. Ward.  It is this.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch attacks upon the conception of mechanism are not purely destructive\\r\\nin their aim.  The man who makes them wishes to destroy one view of the\\r\\nsystem of things in order that he may set up another.  If the changes in\\r\\nthe system of material things cannot be accounted for mechanically, it is\\r\\nargued, we are compelled to turn for our explanation to the action and\\r\\ninteraction of minds.  This seems to give mind a very important place in\\r\\nthe universe, and is believed to make for a view of things that\\r\\nguarantees the satisfaction of the highest hopes and aspirations of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat a recognition of the mechanical order of nature is incompatible with\\r\\nsuch a view of things as is just above indicated, I should be the last to\\r\\nadmit.  The notion that it is so is, I believe, a dangerous error.  It is\\r\\nan error that tends to put a man out of sympathy with the efforts of\\r\\nscience to discover that the world is an orderly whole, and tempts him to\\r\\nrejoice in the contemplation of human ignorance.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the error is rather a common one; and see to what injustice it may\\r\\nlead one.  It is concluded that the conception of _matter_ is an obscure\\r\\none; that we do not know clearly what we mean when we speak of the _mass_\\r\\nof a body; that there are disputes as to proper significance to be given\\r\\nto the words _cause_ and _effect_; that the _laws of motion_, as they are\\r\\nat present formulated, do not seem to account satisfactorily for the\\r\\nbehavior of all material particles.  From this it is inferred that we\\r\\nmust give up the attempt to explain mechanically the order of physical\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, suppose that it were considered a dangerous and heterodox doctrine,\\r\\nthat the changes in the system of things are due to the activities of\\r\\nminds.  Would not those who now love to point out the shortcomings of the\\r\\nscience of mechanics discover a fine field for their destructive\\r\\ncriticism?  Are there no disputes as to the ultimate nature of mind?  Are\\r\\nmen agreed touching the relations of mind and matter?  What science even\\r\\nattempts to tell us how a mind, by an act of volition, sets material\\r\\nparticles in motion or changes the direction of their motion?  How does\\r\\none mind act upon another, and what does it mean for one mind to act upon\\r\\nanother?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the science of mechanics is not in all respects as complete a science\\r\\nas it is desirable that it should be, surely we must admit that when we\\r\\nturn to the field of mind we are not dealing with what is clear and free\\r\\nfrom difficulties.  Only a strong emotional bias can lead a man to dwell\\r\\nwith emphasis upon the difficulties to be met with in the one field, and\\r\\nto pass lightly over those with which one meets in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne may, however, refuse to admit that the order of nature is throughout\\r\\nmechanical, without taking any such unreasonable position as this.  One\\r\\nmay hold that many of the changes in material things do not _appear_ to\\r\\nbe mechanical, and that it is too much of an assumption to maintain that\\r\\nthey are such, even as an article of faith.  Thus, when we pass from the\\r\\nworld of the inorganic to that of organic life, we seem to make an\\r\\nimmense step.  No one has even begun to show us that the changes that\\r\\ntake place in vegetable and animal organisms are all mechanical changes.\\r\\nHow can we dare to assume that they are?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one who reasons thus we may certainly feel a sympathy.  The most\\r\\nardent advocate of mechanism must admit that his doctrine is a working\\r\\nhypothesis, and not _proved_ to be true.  Its acceptance would, however,\\r\\nbe a genuine convenience from the point of view of science, for it does\\r\\nintroduce, at least provisionally, a certain order into a vast number of\\r\\nfacts, and gives a direction to investigation.  Perhaps the wisest thing\\r\\nto do is, not to combat the doctrine, but to accept it tentatively and to\\r\\nexamine carefully what conclusions it may seem to carry with it--how it\\r\\nmay affect our outlook upon the world as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n45. THE PLACE OF MIND IN NATURE.--One of the very first questions which\\r\\nwe think of asking when we contemplate the possibility that the physical\\r\\nworld is throughout a mechanical system is this: How can we conceive\\r\\nminds to be related to such a system?  That minds, and many minds, do\\r\\nexist, it is not reasonable to doubt.  What shall we do with them?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must not misunderstand the mechanical view of things.  When we use\\r\\nthe word \"machine,\" we call before our minds certain gross and relatively\\r\\nsimple mechanisms constructed by man.  Between such and a flower, a\\r\\nbutterfly, and a human body, the difference is enormous.  He who elects\\r\\nto bring the latter under the title of mechanism cannot mean that he\\r\\ndiscerns no difference between them and a steam engine or a printing\\r\\npress.  He can only mean that he believes he might, could he attain to a\\r\\nglimpse into their infinite complexity, find an explanation of the\\r\\nphysical changes which take place in them, by a reference to certain\\r\\ngeneral laws which describe the behavior of material particles everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the man who, having extended his notion of mechanism, is inclined to\\r\\noverlook the fact that animals and men have minds, that thought and\\r\\nfeeling, plan and purpose, have their place in the world, may justly be\\r\\naccused of a headlong and heedless enthusiasm.  Whatever may be our\\r\\nopinion on the subject of the mechanism of nature, we have no right to\\r\\nminimize the significance of thought and feeling and will.  Between that\\r\\nwhich has no mind and that which has a mind there is a difference which\\r\\ncannot be obliterated by bringing both under the concept of mechanism.\\r\\nIt is a difference which furnishes the material for the sciences of\\r\\npsychology and ethics, and gives rise to a whole world of distinctions\\r\\nwhich find no place in the realm of the merely physical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, then, minds as well as bodies; what place shall we assign to\\r\\nthese minds in the system of nature?\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral centuries ago it occurred to the man of science that the material\\r\\nworld should be regarded as a system in which there is constant\\r\\ntransformation, but in which nothing is created.  This way of looking at\\r\\nthings expressed itself formerly in the statement that, through all the\\r\\nchanges that take place in the world, the quantity of matter and motion\\r\\nremains the same.  To-day the same idea is better expressed in the\\r\\ndoctrine of the eternity of mass and the conservation of energy.  In\\r\\nplain language, this doctrine teaches that every change in every part of\\r\\nthe physical world, every motion in matter, must be preceded by physical\\r\\nconditions which may be regarded as the equivalent of the change in\\r\\nquestion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this makes the physical world a closed system, a something complete\\r\\nin itself.  Where is there room in such a system for minds?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does indeed seem hard to find in such a system a place for minds, if\\r\\none conceives of minds as does the interactionist.  We have seen (section\\r\\n36) that the interactionist makes the mind act upon matter very much as\\r\\none particle of matter is supposed to act upon another.  Between the\\r\\nphysical and the mental he assumes that there are _causal_ relations;\\r\\n_i.e._ physical changes must be referred to mental causes sometimes, and\\r\\nmental changes to physical.  This means that he finds a place for mental\\r\\nfacts by inserting them as links in the one chain of causes and effects\\r\\nwith physical facts.  If he is not allowed to break the chain and insert\\r\\nthem, he does not know what to do with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parallelist has not the same difficulty to face.  He who holds that\\r\\nmental phenomena must not be built into the one series of causes and\\r\\neffects with physical phenomena may freely admit that physical phenomena\\r\\nform a closed series, an orderly system of their own, and he may yet find\\r\\na place in the world for minds.  He refuses to regard them as a part of\\r\\nthe world-mechanism, but he _relates_ them to physical things, conceiving\\r\\nthem as _parallel to_ the physical in the sense described (sections\\r\\n37-39).  He insists that, even if we hold that there are gaps in the\\r\\nphysical order of causes and effects, we cannot conceive these gaps to be\\r\\nfilled by mental phenomena, simply because they are mental phenomena.\\r\\nThey belong to an order of their own.  Hence, the assumption that the\\r\\nphysical series is unbroken does not seem to him to crowd mental\\r\\nphenomena out of their place in the world at all.  They must, in any\\r\\ncase, occupy the place that is appropriate to them (section 38).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noticed that this doctrine that the chain of physical causes\\r\\nand effects is nowhere broken, and that mental phenomena are related to\\r\\nit as the parallelist conceives them to be, makes the world-system a very\\r\\norderly one.  Every phenomenon has its place in it, and can be accounted\\r\\nfor, whether it be physical or mental.  To some, the thought that the\\r\\nworld is such an orderly thing is in the highest degree repugnant.  They\\r\\nobject that, in such a world, there is no room for _free-will_; and they\\r\\nobject, further, that there is no room for the _activity of minds_.  Both\\r\\nof these objections I shall consider in this chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut first, I must say a few words about a type of doctrine lately\\r\\ninsisted upon,[1] which bears some resemblance to interactionism as we\\r\\nusually meet with it, and, nevertheless, tries to hold on to the doctrine\\r\\nof the conservation of energy.  It is this:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of energy is stretched in such a way as to make it cover\\r\\nmental phenomena as well as physical.  It is claimed that mental\\r\\nphenomena and physical phenomena are alike \"manifestations of energy,\"\\r\\nand that the coming into being of a consciousness is a mere\\r\\n\"transformation,\" a something to be accounted for by the disappearance\\r\\nfrom the physical world of a certain equivalent--perhaps of some motion.\\r\\nIt will be noticed that this is one rather subtle way of obliterating the\\r\\ndistinction between mental phenomena and physical.  In so far it\\r\\nresembles the interactionist\\'s doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn criticism of it we may say that he who accepts it has wandered away\\r\\nfrom a rather widely recognized scientific hypothesis, and has\\r\\nsubstituted for it a very doubtful speculation for which there seems to\\r\\nbe no whit of evidence.  It is, moreover, a speculation repugnant to the\\r\\nscientific mind, when its significance is grasped.  Shall we assume\\r\\nwithout evidence that, when a man wakes in the morning and enjoys a\\r\\nmental life suspended or diminished during the night, his thoughts and\\r\\nfeelings have come into being at the expense of his body?  Shall we\\r\\nassume that the mass of his body has been slightly diminished, or that\\r\\nmotions have disappeared in a way that cannot be accounted for by a\\r\\nreference to the laws of matter in motion?  This seems an extraordinary\\r\\nassumption, and one little in harmony with the doctrine of the eternity\\r\\nof mass and the conservation of energy as commonly understood.  We need\\r\\nnot take it seriously so long as it is quite unsupported by evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n46. THE ORDER OF NATURE AND \"FREE-WILL.\"--In a world as orderly as, in\\r\\nthe previous section, this world is conceived to be, is there any room\\r\\nfor freedom?  What if the man of science is right in suspecting that the\\r\\nseries of physical causes and effects is nowhere broken?  Must we then\\r\\nconclude that we are never free?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many persons it has seemed that we are forced to draw this conclusion,\\r\\nand it is not surprising that they view the doctrine with dismay.  They\\r\\nargue: Mental phenomena are made parallel with physical, and the order of\\r\\nphysical phenomena seems to be determined throughout, for nothing can\\r\\nhappen in the world of matter unless there is some adequate cause of its\\r\\nhappening.  If, then, I choose to raise my finger, that movement must be\\r\\nadmitted to have physical causes, and those causes other causes, and so\\r\\non without end.  If such a movement must always have its place in a\\r\\ncausal series of this kind, how can it be regarded as a free movement?\\r\\nIt is determined, and not free.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it is far from a pleasant thing to watch the man of science busily\\r\\nat work trying to prove that the physical world is an orderly system, and\\r\\nall the while to feel in one\\'s heart that the success of his efforts\\r\\ncondemns one to slavery.  It can hardly fail to make one\\'s attitude\\r\\ntowards science that of alarm and antagonism.  From this I shall try to\\r\\nfree the reader by showing that our freedom is not in the least danger,\\r\\nand that we may look on unconcerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we approach that venerable dispute touching the freedom of the will,\\r\\nwhich has inspired men to such endless discussions, and upon which they\\r\\nhave written with such warmth and even acrimony, the very first thing to\\r\\ndo is to discover what we have a right to mean when we call a man _free_.\\r\\nAs long as the meaning of the word is in doubt, the very subject of the\\r\\ndispute is in doubt.  When may we, then, properly call a man free?  What\\r\\nis the normal application of the term?\\r\\n\\r\\nI raise my finger.  Every man of sense must admit that, under normal\\r\\nconditions, I can raise my finger or keep it down, _as I please_.  There\\r\\nis no ground for a difference of opinion so far.  But there is a further\\r\\npoint upon which men differ.  One holds that my \"pleasing\" and the\\r\\nbrain-change that corresponds to it have their place in the world-order;\\r\\nthat is, he maintains that every volition can be _accounted for_.\\r\\nAnother holds that, under precisely the same circumstances, one may\\r\\n\"please\" or not \"please\"; which means that the \"pleasing\" cannot be\\r\\nwholly accounted for by anything that has preceded.  The first man is a\\r\\n_determinist_, and the second a \"_free-willist_.\"  I beg the reader to\\r\\nobserve that the word \"free-willist\" is in quotation marks, and not to\\r\\nsuppose that it means simply a believer in the freedom of the will.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in common life we speak of a man as free, what do we understand by\\r\\nthe word?  Usually we mean that he is free from external compulsion.  If\\r\\nmy finger is held by another, I am not free to raise it.  But I may be\\r\\nfree in this sense, and yet one may demur to the statement that I am a\\r\\nfree man.  If a pistol be held to my head with the remark, \"Hands up!\" my\\r\\nfinger will mount very quickly, and the bystanders will maintain that I\\r\\nhad no choice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe speak in somewhat the same way of men under the influence of\\r\\nintoxicants, of men crazed by some passion and unable to take into\\r\\nconsideration the consequences of their acts, and of men bound by the\\r\\nspell of hypnotic suggestion.  Indeed, whenever a man is in such a\\r\\ncondition that he is glaringly incapable of leading a normal human life\\r\\nand of being influenced by the motives that commonly move men, we are\\r\\ninclined to say that he is not free.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut does it ever occur to us to maintain that, in general, the possession\\r\\nof a character and the capacity of being influenced by considerations\\r\\nmake it impossible for a man to be free?  Surely not.  If I am a prudent\\r\\nman, I will invest my money in good securities.  Is it sensible to say\\r\\nthat I cannot have been free in refusing a twenty per cent investment,\\r\\n_because I am by nature prudent_?  Am I a slave _because I eat when I am\\r\\nhungry_, and can I partake of a meal freely, only when there is no reason\\r\\nwhy I should eat at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who calls me free only when my acts do violence to my nature or cannot\\r\\nbe justified by a reference to anything whatever has strange notions of\\r\\nfreedom.  Patriots, poets, moralists, have had much to say of freedom;\\r\\nmen have lived for it, and have died for it; men love it as they love\\r\\ntheir own souls.  Is the object of all this adoration the metaphysical\\r\\nabsurdity indicated above?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo insist that a man is free only in so far as his actions are\\r\\nunaccountable is to do violence to the meaning of a word in very common\\r\\nuse, and to mislead men by perverting it to strange and unwholesome uses.\\r\\nYet this is done by the \"free-willist.\"  He keeps insisting that man is\\r\\nfree, and then goes on to maintain that he cannot be free unless he is\\r\\n\"free.\"  He does not, unfortunately, supply the quotation marks, and he\\r\\nprofits by the natural mistake in identity.  As he defines freedom it\\r\\nbecomes \"freedom,\" which is a very different thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is this \"freedom\"?  It is not freedom from external constraint.  It\\r\\nis not freedom from overpowering passion.  It is freedom from all the\\r\\nmotives, good as well as bad, that we can conceive of as influencing man,\\r\\nand freedom also from oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to get this quite clear.  The \"free-willist\" maintains that,\\r\\n_in so far as a man is \"free,\"_ his actions cannot be accounted for by a\\r\\nreference to the order of causes at all--not by a reference to his\\r\\ncharacter, hereditary or acquired; not by a reference to his\\r\\nsurroundings.  \"Free\" actions, in so far as they are \"free,\" have, so to\\r\\nspeak, sprung into being out of the void.  What follows from such a\\r\\ndoctrine?  Listen:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) It follows that, in so far as I am \"free,\" I am not the author of\\r\\nwhat appear to be my acts; who can be the cause of causeless actions?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) It follows that no amount of effort on my part can prevent the\\r\\nappearance of \"free\" acts of the most deplorable kind.  If one can\\r\\ncondition their appearance or non-appearance, they are not \"free\" acts.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) It follows that there is no reason to believe that there will be any\\r\\ncongruity between my character and my \"free\" acts.  I may be a saint by\\r\\nnature, and \"freely\" act like a scoundrel.\\r\\n\\r\\n(4) It follows that I can deserve no credit for \"free\" acts.  I am not\\r\\ntheir author.\\r\\n\\r\\n(5) It follows that, in so far as I am \"free,\" it is useless to praise\\r\\nme, to blame me, to punish me, to endeavor to persuade me.  I must be\\r\\ngiven over to unaccountable sainthood or to a reprobate mind, as it\\r\\nhappens to happen.  I am quite beyond the pale of society, for my\\r\\nneighbor cannot influence my \"free\" acts any more than I can.\\r\\n\\r\\n(6) It follows that, in so far as I am \"free,\" I am in something very\\r\\nlike a state of slavery; and yet, curiously enough, it is a slavery\\r\\nwithout a master.  In the old stories of Fate, men were represented as\\r\\npuppets in the hand of a power outside themselves.  Here I am a puppet in\\r\\nno hand; but I am a puppet just the same, for I am the passive spectator\\r\\nof what appear to be my acts.  I do not do the things I seem to do.  They\\r\\nare done for me or in me--or, rather, they are not done, but just happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch \"freedom\" is a wretched thing to offer to a man who longs for\\r\\nfreedom; for the freedom to act out his own impulses, to guide his life\\r\\naccording to his own ideals.  It is a mere travesty on freedom, a fiction\\r\\nof the philosophers, which inspires respect only so long as one has not\\r\\npierced the disguise of its respectable name.  True freedom is not a\\r\\nthing to be sought in a disorderly and chaotic world, in a world in which\\r\\nactions are inexplicable and character does not count.  Let us rinse our\\r\\nminds free of misleading verbal associations, and let us realize that a\\r\\n\"free-will\" neighbor would certainly not be to us an object of respect.\\r\\nHe would be as offensive an object to have in our vicinity as a\\r\\n\"free-will\" gun or a \"free-will\" pocketknife.  He would not be a rational\\r\\ncreature.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur only concern need be for freedom, and this is in no danger in an\\r\\norderly world.  We all recognize this truth, in a way.  We hold that a\\r\\nman of good character freely chooses the good, and a man of evil\\r\\ncharacter freely chooses evil.  Is not this a recognition of the fact\\r\\nthat the choice is a thing to be accounted for, and is, nevertheless, a\\r\\nfree choice?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have been considering above the world as it is conceived to be by the\\r\\nparallelist, but, to the reader who may not incline towards parallelism,\\r\\nI wish to point out that these reasonings touching the freedom of the\\r\\nwill concern the interactionist just as closely.  They have no necessary\\r\\nconnection with parallelism.  The interactionist, as well as the\\r\\nparallelist, may be a determinist, a believer in freedom, or he may be a\\r\\n\"free-willist.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe regards mental phenomena and physical phenomena as links in the one\\r\\nchain of causes and effects.  Shall he hold that certain mental links are\\r\\n\"free-will\" links, that they are wholly unaccountable?  If he does, all\\r\\nthat has been said above about the \"free-willist\" applies to him.  He\\r\\nbelieves in a disorderly world, and he should accept the consequences of\\r\\nhis doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\n47. THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND THE MORAL WORLD.--I have said a little way\\r\\nback that, when we think of bodies as having minds, we are introduced to\\r\\na world of distinctions which have no place in the realm of the merely\\r\\nphysical.  One of the objections made to the orderly world of the\\r\\nparallelist was that in it there is no room for the activity of minds.\\r\\nBefore we pass judgment on this matter, we should try to get some clear\\r\\nnotion of what we may mean by the word \"activity.\"  The science of ethics\\r\\nmust go by the board, if we cannot think of men as _doing_ anything, as\\r\\nacting rightly or acting wrongly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us conceive a billiard ball in motion to come into collision with one\\r\\nat rest.  We commonly speak of the first ball as active, and of the\\r\\nsecond as the passive subject upon which it exercises its activity.  Are\\r\\nwe justified in thus speaking?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one sense, of course, we are.  As I have several times had occasion to\\r\\nremark, we are, in common life, justified in using words rather loosely,\\r\\nprovided that it is convenient to do so, and that it does not give rise\\r\\nto misunderstandings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, in a stricter sense, we are not justified in thus speaking, for in\\r\\ndoing so we are carrying over into the sphere of the merely physical a\\r\\ndistinction which does not properly belong there, but has its place in\\r\\nanother realm.  The student of mechanics tells us that the second ball\\r\\nhas affected the first quite as much as the first has affected the\\r\\nsecond.  We cannot simply regard the first as cause and the second as\\r\\neffect, nor may we regard the motion of the first as cause and the\\r\\nsubsequent motion of the second as its effect alone.  _The whole\\r\\nsituation at the one instant_--both balls, their relative positions and\\r\\ntheir motion and rest--must be taken as the cause of _the whole situation\\r\\nat the next instant_, and in this whole situation the condition of the\\r\\nsecond ball has its place as well as that of the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, we insist that to have causal efficiency is the same thing as\\r\\nto be active, we should also admit that the second ball was active, and\\r\\nquite as active as the first.  It has certainly had as much to do with\\r\\nthe total result.  But it offends us to speak of it in this way.  We\\r\\nprefer to say that the first was active and the second was acted upon.\\r\\nWhat is the source of this distinction?\\r\\n\\r\\nIts original source is to be found in the judgments we pass upon\\r\\nconscious beings, bodies with minds; and it could never have been drawn\\r\\nif men had not taken into consideration the relations of minds to the\\r\\nchanges in the physical world.  As carried over to inanimate things it is\\r\\na transferred distinction; and its transference to this field is not\\r\\nstrictly justifiable, as has been indicated above.\\r\\n\\r\\nI must make this clear by an illustration.  I hurry along a street\\r\\ntowards the university, because the hour for my lecture is approaching.\\r\\nI am struck down by a falling tile.  In my advance up the street I am\\r\\nregarded as active; in my fall to the ground I am regarded as passive.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, looking at both occurrences from the purely physical point of view,\\r\\nwe have nothing before us but a series of changes in the space relations\\r\\nof certain masses of matter; and in all those changes both my body and\\r\\nits environment are concerned.  As I advance, my body cannot be regarded\\r\\nas the sole cause of the changes which are taking place.  My progress\\r\\nwould be impossible without the aid of the ground upon which I tread.\\r\\nNor can I accuse the tile of being the sole cause of my demolition.  Had\\r\\nI not been what I was and where I was, the tile would have fallen in\\r\\nvain.  I must be regarded as a concurrent cause of my own disaster, and\\r\\nmy unhappy state is attributable to me as truly as it is to the tile.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, then, am I in the one case regarded as active and in the other as\\r\\npassive?  In each case I am a cause of the result.  How does it happen\\r\\nthat, in the first instance, I seem to most men to be _the_ cause, and in\\r\\nthe second to be not a cause at all?  The rapidity of my motion in the\\r\\nfirst instance cannot account for this judgment.  He who rides in the\\r\\npolice van and he who is thrown from the car of a balloon may move with\\r\\ngreat rapidity and yet be regarded as passive.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen speak as they do because they are not content to point out the\\r\\nphysical antecedents of this and that occurrence and stop with that.\\r\\nThey recognize that, between my advance up the street and my fall to the\\r\\nground there is one very important difference.  In the first case what is\\r\\nhappening _may be referred to an idea in my mind_.  Were the idea not\\r\\nthere, I should not do what I am doing.  In the second case, what has\\r\\nhappened _cannot be referred to an idea in my mind_.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we have come to the recognition that there are such things as\\r\\n_purposes_ and _ends_; that an idea and some change in the external world\\r\\nmay be related as _plan_ and _accomplishment_.  In other words, we have\\r\\nbeen brought face to face with what has been given the somewhat\\r\\nmisleading name of _final cause_.  In so far as that in the bringing\\r\\nabout of which I have had a share is my _end_, I am _active_; in so far\\r\\nas it is not my end, but comes upon me as something not planned, I am\\r\\n_passive_.  The enormous importance of the distinction may readily be\\r\\nseen; it is only in so far as I am a creature who can have purposes, that\\r\\n_desire_ and _will_, _foresight_ and _prudence_, _right_ and _wrong_, can\\r\\nhave a significance for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have dwelt upon the meaning of the words \"activity\" and \"passivity,\"\\r\\nand have been at pains to distinguish them from cause and effect, because\\r\\nthe two pairs of terms have often been confounded with each other, and\\r\\nthis confusion has given rise to a peculiarly unfortunate error.  It is\\r\\nthis error that lies at the foundation of the objection referred to at\\r\\nthe beginning of this section.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen that certain men of science are inclined to look upon the\\r\\nphysical world as a great system, all the changes in which may be\\r\\naccounted for by an appeal to physical causes.  And we have seen that the\\r\\nparallelist regards ideas, not as links in this chain, but as parallel\\r\\nwith physical changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is argued by some that, if this is a true view of things, we must\\r\\nembrace the conclusion that _the mind cannot be active at all_, that it\\r\\ncan _accomplish nothing_.  We must look upon the mind as an\\r\\n\"epiphenomenon,\" a useless decoration; and must regard man as \"a physical\\r\\nautomaton with parallel psychical states.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch abuse of one\\'s fellow-man seems unchristian, and it is wholly\\r\\nuncalled for on any hypothesis.  Our first answer to it is that it seems\\r\\nto be sufficiently refuted by the experiences of common life.  We have\\r\\nabundant evidence that men\\'s minds do count for something.  I conclude\\r\\nthat I want a coat, and I order one of my tailor; he believes that I will\\r\\npay for it, he wants the money, and he makes the coat; his man desires to\\r\\nearn his wages and he delivers it.  If I had not wanted the coat, if the\\r\\ntailor had not wanted my money, if the man had not wanted to earn his\\r\\nwages, the end would not have been attained.  No philosopher has the\\r\\nright to deny these facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh! but, it may be answered, these three \"wants\" are not supposed to be\\r\\nthe _causes_ of the motions in matter which result in my appearing\\r\\nwell-dressed on Sunday.  They are only _concomitant phenomena_.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this I reply: What of that?  We must not forget what is meant by such\\r\\nconcomitance (section 39).  We are dealing with a fixed and necessary\\r\\nrelation, not with an accidental one.  If these \"wants\" had been lacking,\\r\\nthere would have been no coat.  So my second answer to the objector is,\\r\\nthat, on the hypothesis of the parallelist, the relations between mental\\r\\nphenomena and physical phenomena are just as dependable as that relation\\r\\nbetween physical phenomena which we call that of cause and effect.\\r\\nMoreover, since activity and causality are not the same thing, there is\\r\\nno ground for asserting that the mind cannot be active, merely because it\\r\\nis not material and, hence, cannot be, strictly speaking, a cause of\\r\\nmotions in matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plain man is entirely in the right in thinking that minds are active.\\r\\nThe truth is that _nothing can be active except as it has a mind_.  The\\r\\nrelation of purpose and end is the one we have in view when we speak of\\r\\nthe activity of minds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, thus, highly unjust to a man to tell him that he is \"a physical\\r\\nautomaton with parallel psychical states,\" and that he is wound up by\\r\\nputting food into his mouth.  He who hears this may be excused if he\\r\\nfeels it his duty to emit steam, walk with a jerk, and repudiate all\\r\\nresponsibility for his actions.  Creatures that think, form plans, and\\r\\n_act_, are not what we call automata.  It is an abuse of language to call\\r\\nthem such, and it misleads us into looking upon them as we have no right\\r\\nto look upon them.  If men really were automata in the proper sense of\\r\\nthe word, we could not look upon them as wise or unwise, good or bad; in\\r\\nshort, the whole world of moral distinctions would vanish.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps, in spite of all that has been said in this and in the preceding\\r\\nsection, some will feel a certain repugnance to being assigned a place in\\r\\na world as orderly as our world is in this chapter conceived to be--a\\r\\nworld in which every phenomenon, whether physical or mental, has its\\r\\ndefinite place, and all are subject to law.  But I suppose our content or\\r\\ndiscontent will not be independent of our conception of what sort of a\\r\\nworld we conceive ourselves to be inhabiting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we conclude that we are in a world in which God is revealed, if the\\r\\norderliness of it is but another name for Divine Providence, we can\\r\\nscarcely feel the same as we would if we discovered in the world nothing\\r\\nof the Divine.  I have in the last few pages been discussing the doctrine\\r\\nof purposes and ends, teleology, but I have said nothing of the\\r\\nsignificance of that doctrine for Theism.  The reader can easily see that\\r\\nit lies at the very foundation of our belief in God.  The only arguments\\r\\nfor theism that have had much weight with mankind have been those which\\r\\nhave maintained there are revealed in the world generally evidences of a\\r\\nplan and purpose at least analogous to what we discover when we\\r\\nscrutinize the actions of our fellow-man.  Such arguments are not at the\\r\\nmercy of either interactionist or parallelist.  On either hypothesis they\\r\\nstand unshaken.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this brief survey of some of the most interesting problems that\\r\\nconfront the philosopher, I must content myself here.  Now let us turn\\r\\nand see how some of the fundamental problems treated in previous chapters\\r\\nhave been approached by men belonging to certain well-recognized schools\\r\\nof thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd since it is peculiarly true in philosophy that, to understand the\\r\\npresent, one must know something of the past, we shall begin by taking a\\r\\nlook at the historical background of the types of philosophical doctrine\\r\\nto which reference is constantly made in the books and journals of the\\r\\nday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Ostwald, \"Vorlesungen \\xc3\\xbcber Naturphilosophie,\" s. 396.  Leipzig, 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIV. SOME TYPES OF PHILOSOPHICAL THEORY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEIR HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\\r\\n\\r\\n48. THE DOCTRINE OF REPRESENTATIVE PERCEPTION.--We have seen in Chapter\\r\\nII that it seems to the plain man abundantly evident that he really is\\r\\nsurrounded by material things and that he directly perceives such\\r\\nthings.  This has always been the opinion of the plain man and it seems\\r\\nprobable that it always will be.  It is only when he begins to reflect\\r\\nupon things and upon his knowledge of them that it occurs to him to\\r\\ncall it in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery early in the history of speculative thought it occurred to men,\\r\\nhowever, to ask how it is that we know things, and whether we are sure\\r\\nwe do know them.  The problems of reflection started into life, and\\r\\nvarious solutions were suggested.  To tell over the whole list would\\r\\ntake us far afield, and we need not, for the purpose we have in view,\\r\\ngo back farther than Descartes, with whom philosophy took a relatively\\r\\nnew start, and may be said to have become, in spirit and method, at\\r\\nleast, modern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said (section 31) that Descartes (1596-1650) was fairly well\\r\\nacquainted with the functioning of the nervous system, and has much to\\r\\nsay of the messages which pass along the nerves to the brain.  The same\\r\\nsort of reasoning that leads the modern psychologist to maintain that\\r\\nwe know only so much of the external world as is reflected in our\\r\\nsensations led him to maintain that the mind is directly aware of the\\r\\nideas through which an external world is represented, but can know the\\r\\nworld itself only indirectly and through these ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes was put to sore straits to prove the existence of an external\\r\\nworld, when he had once thus placed it at one remove from us.  If we\\r\\naccept his doctrine, we seem to be shut up within the circle of our\\r\\nideas, and can find no door that will lead us to a world outside.  The\\r\\nquestion will keep coming back: How do we _know_ that, corresponding to\\r\\nour ideas, there are material things, if we have never perceived, in\\r\\nany single instance, a material thing?  And the doubt here suggested\\r\\nmay be reinforced by the reflection that the very expression \"a\\r\\nmaterial thing\" ought to be meaningless to a man who, having never had\\r\\nexperience of one, is compelled to represent it by the aid of something\\r\\nso different from it as ideas are supposed to be.  Can material things\\r\\nreally be to such a creature anything more than some complex of ideas?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulties presented by any philosophical doctrine are not always\\r\\nevident at once.  Descartes made no scruple of accepting the existence\\r\\nof an external world, and his example has been followed by a very large\\r\\nnumber of those who agree with his initial assumption that the mind\\r\\nknows immediately only its own ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nPre\\xc3\\xabminent among such we must regard John Locke, the English\\r\\nphilosopher (1632-1704), whose classic work, \"An Essay concerning Human\\r\\nUnderstanding,\" should not be wholly unknown to any one who pretends to\\r\\nan interest in the English literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmirably does Locke represent the position of what very many have\\r\\nregarded as the prudent and sensible man,--the man who recognizes that\\r\\nideas are not external things, and that things must be known through\\r\\nideas, and yet holds on to the existence of a material world which we\\r\\nassuredly know.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe recognizes, it is true, that some one may find a possible opening\\r\\nfor the expression of a doubt, but he regards the doubt as gratuitous;\\r\\n\"I think nobody can, in earnest, be so skeptical as to be uncertain of\\r\\nthe existence of those things which he sees and feels.\"  As we have\\r\\nseen (section 12), he meets the doubt with a jest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, those who read with attention Locke\\'s admirably clear\\r\\npages must notice that he does not succeed in really setting to rest\\r\\nthe doubt that has suggested itself.  It becomes clear that Locke felt\\r\\nso sure of the existence of the external world because he now and then\\r\\nslipped into the inconsistent doctrine that he perceived it\\r\\nimmediately, and not merely through his ideas.  Are those things \"which\\r\\nhe sees and feels\" _external_ things?  Does he see and feel them\\r\\ndirectly, or must he infer from his ideas that he sees and feels them?\\r\\nIf the latter, why may one not still doubt?  Evidently the appeal is to\\r\\na direct experience of material things, and Locke has forgotten that he\\r\\nmust be a Lockian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often remarked, in many instances,\" writes Descartes, \"that\\r\\nthere is a great difference between an object and its idea.\"  How could\\r\\nthe man possibly have remarked this, when he had never in his life\\r\\nperceived the object corresponding to any idea, but had been altogether\\r\\nshut up to ideas?  \"Thus I see, whilst I write this,\" says Locke,[1] \"I\\r\\ncan change the appearance of the paper, and by designing the letters\\r\\ntell beforehand what new idea it shall exhibit the very next moment, by\\r\\nbarely drawing my pen over it, which will neither appear (let me fancy\\r\\nas much as I will), if my hand stands still, or though I move my pen,\\r\\nif my eyes be shut; nor, when those characters are once made on the\\r\\npaper, can I choose afterward but see them as they are; that is, have\\r\\nthe ideas of such letters as I have made.  Whence it is manifest, that\\r\\nthey are not barely the sport and play of my own imagination, when I\\r\\nfind that the characters that were made at the pleasure of my own\\r\\nthought do not obey them; nor yet cease to be, whenever I shall fancy\\r\\nit; but continue to affect the senses constantly and regularly,\\r\\naccording to the figures I made them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke is as bad as Descartes.  Evidently he regards himself as able to\\r\\nturn to the external world and perceive the relation that things hold\\r\\nto ideas.  Such an inconsistency may escape the writer who has been\\r\\nguilty of it, but it is not likely to escape the notice of all those\\r\\nwho come after him.  Some one is sure to draw the consequences of a\\r\\ndoctrine more rigorously, and to come to conclusions, it may be, very\\r\\nunpalatable to the man who propounded the doctrine in the first\\r\\ninstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of doctrine represented by Descartes and Locke is that of\\r\\n_Representative Perception_.  It holds that we know real external\\r\\nthings only through their mental representatives.  It has also been\\r\\ncalled _Hypothetical Realism_, because it accepts the existence of a\\r\\nreal world, but bases our knowledge of it upon an inference from our\\r\\nsensations or ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n49. THE STEP TO IDEALISM.--The admirable clearness with which Locke\\r\\nwrites makes it the easier for his reader to detect the untenability of\\r\\nhis position.  He uses simple language, and he never takes refuge in\\r\\nvague and ambiguous phrases.  When he tells us that the mind is wholly\\r\\nshut up to its ideas, and then later assumes that it is not shut up to\\r\\nits ideas, but can perceive external things, we see plainly that there\\r\\nmust be a blunder somewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Berkeley (1684-1753), Bishop of Cloyne, followed out more\\r\\nrigorously the consequences to be deduced from the assumption that all\\r\\nour direct knowledge is of ideas; and in a youthful work of the highest\\r\\ngenius entitled \"The Principles of Human Knowledge,\" he maintained that\\r\\nthere is no material world at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we examine with care the objects of sense, the \"things\" which\\r\\npresent themselves to us, he argues, we find that they resolve\\r\\nthemselves into sensations, or \"ideas of sense.\"  What can we mean by\\r\\nthe word \"apple,\" if we do not mean the group of experiences in which\\r\\nalone an apple is presented to us?  The word is nothing else than a\\r\\nname for this group as a group.  Take away the color, the hardness, the\\r\\nodor, the taste; what have we left?  And color, hardness, odor, taste,\\r\\nand anything else that may be referred to any object as a quality, can\\r\\nexist, he claims, only in a perceiving mind; for such things are\\r\\nnothing else than sensations, and how can there be an unperceived\\r\\nsensation?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe things which we perceive, then, he calls complexes of ideas.  Have\\r\\nwe any reason to believe that these ideas, which exist in the mind, are\\r\\nto be accepted as representatives of things of a different kind, which\\r\\nare not mental at all?  Not a shadow of a reason, says Berkeley; there\\r\\nis simply no basis for inference at all, and we cannot even make clear\\r\\nwhat it is that we are setting out to infer under the name of matter.\\r\\nWe need not, therefore, grieve over the loss of the material world, for\\r\\nwe have suffered no loss; one cannot lose what one has never had.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the objects of human knowledge, the only things of which it means\\r\\nanything to speak, are: (1) Ideas of Sense; (2) Ideas of Memory and\\r\\nImagination; (3) The Passions and Operations of the Mind; and (4) The\\r\\nSelf that perceives all These.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Locke\\'s position to that of Berkeley was a bold step, and it was\\r\\nmuch criticised, as well it might be.  It was felt then, as it has been\\r\\nfelt by many down to our own time, that, when we discard an external\\r\\nworld distinct from our ideas, and admit only the world revealed in our\\r\\nideas, we really do lose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is legitimate to criticise Berkeley, but it is not legitimate to\\r\\nmisunderstand him; and yet the history of his doctrine may almost be\\r\\ncalled a chronicle of misconceptions.  It has been assumed that he drew\\r\\nno distinction between real things and imaginary things, that he made\\r\\nthe world no better than a dream, etc.  Arbuthnot, Swift, and a host of\\r\\nthe greater and lesser lights in literature, from his time to ours,\\r\\nhave made merry over the supposed unrealities in the midst of which the\\r\\nBerkeleian must live.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it should be remembered that Berkeley tried hard to do full justice\\r\\nto the world of things in which we actually find ourselves; not a\\r\\nhypothetical, inferred, unperceived world, but the world of the things\\r\\nwe actually perceive.  He distinguished carefully between what is real\\r\\nand what is merely imaginary, though he called both \"ideas\"; and he\\r\\nrecognized something like a system of nature.  And, by the argument\\r\\nfrom analogy which we have already examined (section 41), he inferred\\r\\nthe existence of other finite minds and of a Divine Mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just as John Locke had not completely thought out the consequences\\r\\nwhich might be deduced from his own doctrines, so Berkeley left, in his\\r\\nturn, an opening for a successor.  It was possible for that acutest of\\r\\nanalysts, David Hume (1711-1776), to treat him somewhat as he had\\r\\ntreated Locke.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the objects of human knowledge Berkeley had included the _self_\\r\\nthat perceives things.  He never succeeded in making at all clear what\\r\\nhe meant by this object; but he regarded it as a substance, and\\r\\nbelieved it to be a cause of changes in ideas, and quite different in\\r\\nits nature from all the ideas attributed to it.  But Hume maintained\\r\\nthat when he tried to get a good look at this self, to catch it, so to\\r\\nspeak, and to hold it up to inspection, he could not find anything\\r\\nwhatever save perceptions, memories, and other things of that kind.\\r\\nThe self is, he said, \"but a bundle or collection of different\\r\\nperceptions which succeed each other with inconceivable rapidity, and\\r\\nare in a perpetual flux and movement.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the objects of sense, our own bodies, the chairs upon which we\\r\\nsit, the tables at which we write, and all the rest--these, argues\\r\\nHume, we are impelled by nature to think of as existing continuously,\\r\\nbut we have no evidence whatever to prove that they do thus exist.  Are\\r\\nnot the objects of sense, after all, only sensations or impressions?\\r\\nDo we not experience these sensations or impressions interruptedly?\\r\\nWho sees or feels a table continuously day after day?  If the table is\\r\\nbut a name for the experiences in question, if we have no right to\\r\\ninfer material things behind and distinct from such experiences, are we\\r\\nnot forced to conclude that the existence of the things that we see and\\r\\nfeel is an interrupted one?\\r\\n\\r\\nHume certainly succeeded in raising more questions than he succeeded in\\r\\nanswering.  We are compelled to admire the wonderful clearness and\\r\\nsimplicity of his style, and the acuteness of his intellect, in every\\r\\nchapter.  But we cannot help feeling that he does injustice to the\\r\\nworld in which we live, even when we cannot quite see what is wrong.\\r\\nDoes it not seem certain to science and to common sense that there is\\r\\nan order of nature in some sense independent of our perceptions, so\\r\\nthat objects may be assumed to exist whether we do or do not perceive\\r\\nthem?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we read Hume we have a sense that we are robbed of our real\\r\\nexternal world; and his account of the mind makes us feel as a badly\\r\\ntied sheaf of wheat may be conceived to feel--in danger of falling\\r\\napart at any moment.  Berkeley we unhesitatingly call an _Idealist_,\\r\\nbut whether we shall apply the name to Hume depends upon the extension\\r\\nwe are willing to give to it.  His world is a world of what we may\\r\\nbroadly call _ideas_; but the tendencies of his philosophy have led\\r\\nsome to call it a _Skepticism_.\\r\\n\\r\\n50. THE REVOLT OF \"COMMON SENSE.\"--Hume\\'s reasonings were too important\\r\\nto be ignored, and his conclusions too unpalatable to satisfy those who\\r\\ncame after him.  It seemed necessary to seek a way of escape out of\\r\\nthis world of mere ideas, which appeared to be so unsatisfactory a\\r\\nworld.  One of the most famous of such attempts was that made by the\\r\\nScotchman Thomas Reid (1710-1796).\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time Reid regarded himself as the disciple of Berkeley, but the\\r\\nconsequences which Hume deduced from the principles laid down by the\\r\\nformer led Reid to feel that he must build upon some wholly different\\r\\nfoundation.  He came to the conclusion that the line of philosophers\\r\\nfrom Descartes to Hume had made one capital error in assuming \"that\\r\\nnothing is perceived but what is in the mind that perceives it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce admit, says Reid, that the mind perceives nothing save ideas, and\\r\\nwe must also admit that it is impossible to prove the existence either\\r\\nof an external world or of a mind different from \"a bundle of\\r\\nperceptions.\"  Hence, Reid maintains that we perceive--not infer, but\\r\\nperceive--_things_ external to the mind.  He writes:[2]--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let a man press his hand against the table--_he feels it hard_.  But\\r\\nwhat is the meaning of this?  The meaning undoubtedly is, that he hath\\r\\na certain feeling of touch, from which he concludes, without any\\r\\nreasoning, or comparing ideas, that there is something external really\\r\\nexisting, whose parts stick so firmly together that they cannot be\\r\\ndisplaced without considerable force.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There is here a feeling, and a conclusion drawn from it, or some way\\r\\nsuggested by it.  In order to compare these, we must view them\\r\\nseparately, and then consider by what tie they are connected, and\\r\\nwherein they resemble one another.  The hardness of the table is the\\r\\nconclusion, the feeling is the medium by which we are led to that\\r\\nconclusion.  Let a man attend distinctly to this medium, and to the\\r\\nconclusion, and he will perceive them to be as unlike as any two things\\r\\nin nature.  The one is a sensation of the mind, which can have no\\r\\nexistence but in a sentient being; nor can it exist one moment longer\\r\\nthan it is felt; the other is in the table, and we conclude, without\\r\\nany difficulty, that it was in the table before it was felt, and\\r\\ncontinues after the feeling is over.  The one implies no kind of\\r\\nextension, nor parts, nor cohesion; the other implies all these.  Both,\\r\\nindeed, admit of degrees, and the feeling, beyond a certain degree, is\\r\\na species of pain; but adamantine hardness does not imply the least\\r\\npain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And as the feeling hath no similitude to hardness, so neither can our\\r\\nreason perceive the least tie or connection between them; nor will the\\r\\nlogician ever be able to show a reason why we should conclude hardness\\r\\nfrom this feeling, rather than softness, or any other quality\\r\\nwhatsoever.  But, in reality, all mankind are led by their constitution\\r\\nto conclude hardness from this feeling.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well worth while to read this extract several times, and to ask\\r\\noneself what Reid meant to say, and what he actually said.  He is\\r\\nobjecting, be it remembered, to the doctrine that the mind perceives\\r\\nimmediately only its own ideas or sensations and must infer all else.\\r\\nHis contention is that we _perceive_ external things.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes he say this?  He says that we have feelings of touch _from which\\r\\nwe conclude_ that there is something external; that there is a feeling,\\r\\n\"_and a conclusion drawn from it, or some way suggested by it_;\" that\\r\\n\"the hardness of the table is the _conclusion_, and the feeling is the\\r\\n_medium_ by which we are _led to the conclusion_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCould Descartes or Locke have more plainly supported the doctrine of\\r\\nrepresentative perception?  How could Reid imagine he was combatting\\r\\nthat doctrine when he wrote thus?  The point in which he differs from\\r\\nthem is this: he maintains that we draw the conclusion in question\\r\\nwithout any reasoning, and, indeed, in the absence of any conceivable\\r\\nreason why we should draw it.  We do it instinctively; we are led by\\r\\nthe constitution of our nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn effect Reid says to us: When you lay your hand on the table, you\\r\\nhave a sensation, it is true, but you also know the table is hard.  How\\r\\ndo you know it?  I cannot tell you; you simply know it, and cannot help\\r\\nknowing it; and that is the end of the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nReid\\'s doctrine was not without its effect upon other philosophers.\\r\\nAmong them we must place Sir William Hamilton (1788-1856), whose\\r\\nwritings had no little influence upon British philosophy in the last\\r\\nhalf of the last century.\\r\\n\\r\\nHamilton complained that Reid did not succeed in being a very good\\r\\n_Natural Realist_, and that he slipped unconsciously into the position\\r\\nhe was concerned to condemn.  Sir William tried to eliminate this\\r\\nerror, but the careful reader of his works will find to his amusement\\r\\nthat this learned author gets his feet upon the same slippery descent.\\r\\nAnd much the same thing may be said of the doctrine of Herbert Spencer\\r\\n(1820-1903), who claims that, when we have a sensation, we know\\r\\ndirectly that there is an external thing, and then manages to sublimate\\r\\nthat external thing into an Unknowable, which we not only do not know\\r\\ndirectly, but even do not know at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of these men were anxious to avoid what they regarded as the perils\\r\\nof Idealism, and yet they seem quite unable to retain a foothold upon\\r\\nthe position which they consider the safer one.\\r\\n\\r\\nReid called his doctrine the philosophy of \"Common Sense,\" and he\\r\\nthought he was coming back from the subtleties of the metaphysicians to\\r\\nthe standpoint of the plain man.  That he should fall into difficulties\\r\\nand inconsistencies is by no means surprising.  As we have seen\\r\\n(section 12), the thought of the plain man is far from clear.  He\\r\\ncertainly believes that we perceive an external world of things, and\\r\\nthe inconsistent way in which Descartes and Locke appeal from ideas to\\r\\nthe things themselves does not strike him as unnatural.  Why should not\\r\\na man test his ideas by turning to things and comparing the former with\\r\\nthe latter?  On the other hand, he knows that to perceive things we\\r\\nmust have sense organs and sensations, and he cannot quarrel with the\\r\\npsychologists for saying that we know things only in so far as they are\\r\\nrevealed to us through our sensations.  How does he reconcile these two\\r\\npositions?  He does not reconcile them.  He accepts them as they stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nReid and various other philosophers have tried to come back to \"Common\\r\\nSense\" and to stay there.  Now, it is a good position to come back to\\r\\nfor the purpose of starting out again.  The experience of the plain\\r\\nman, the truths which he recognizes as truths, these are not things to\\r\\nbe despised.  Many a man whose mind has been, as Berkeley expresses it,\\r\\n\"debauched by learning,\" has gotten away from them to his detriment,\\r\\nand has said very unreasonable things.  But \"Common Sense\" cannot be\\r\\nthe ultimate refuge of the philosopher; it can only serve him as\\r\\nmaterial for investigation.  The scholar whose thought is as vague and\\r\\ninconsistent as that of the plain man has little profit in the fact\\r\\nthat the apparatus of his learning has made it possible for him to be\\r\\nponderously and unintelligibly vague and inconsistent.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, we may have the utmost sympathy with Reid\\'s protest against the\\r\\ndoctrine of representative perception, and we may, nevertheless,\\r\\ncomplain that he has done little to explain how it is that we directly\\r\\nknow external things and yet cannot be said to know things except in so\\r\\nfar as we have sensations or ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n51. THE CRITICAL PHILOSOPHY.--The German philosopher, Immanuel Kant\\r\\n(1724-1804), was moved, by the skeptical conclusions to which Hume\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy seemed to lead, to seek a way of escape, somewhat as Reid\\r\\nwas.  But he did not take refuge in \"Common Sense\"; he developed an\\r\\ningenious doctrine which has had an enormous influence in the\\r\\nphilosophical world, and has given rise to a Kantian literature of such\\r\\nproportions that no man can hope to read all of it, even if he devotes\\r\\nhis life to it.  In Germany and out of it, it has for a hundred years\\r\\nand more simply rained books, pamphlets, and articles on Kant and his\\r\\nphilosophy, some of them good, many of them far from clear and far from\\r\\noriginal.  Hundreds of German university students have taken Kant as\\r\\nthe subject of the dissertation by which they hoped to win the degree\\r\\nof Doctor of Philosophy;--I was lately offered two hundred and\\r\\nseventy-four such dissertations in one bunch;--and no student is\\r\\nsupposed to have even a moderate knowledge of philosophy who has not an\\r\\nacquaintance with that famous work, the \"Critique of Pure Reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to be expected from the outset that, where so many have found so\\r\\nmuch to say, there should reign abundant differences of opinion.  There\\r\\nare differences of opinion touching the interpretation of Kant, and\\r\\ntouching the criticisms which may be made upon, and the development\\r\\nwhich should be given to, his doctrine.  It is, of course, impossible\\r\\nto go into all these things here; and I shall do no more than indicate,\\r\\nin untechnical language and in briefest outline, what he offers us in\\r\\nplace of the philosophy of Hume.\\r\\n\\r\\nKant did not try to refute, as did Reid, the doctrine, urged by\\r\\nDescartes and by his successors, that all those things which the mind\\r\\ndirectly perceives are to be regarded as complexes of ideas.  On the\\r\\ncontrary, he accepted it, and he has made the words \"phenomenon\" and\\r\\n\"noumenon\" household words in philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world which seems to be spread out before us in space and time is,\\r\\nhe tells us, a world of things _as they are revealed to our senses and\\r\\nour intelligence_; it is a world of manifestations, of phenomena.  What\\r\\nthings-in-themselves are like we have no means of knowing; we know only\\r\\nthings as they appear to us.  We may, to be sure, talk of a something\\r\\ndistinct from phenomena, a something not revealed to the senses, but\\r\\nthought of, a _noumenon_; but we should not forget that this is a\\r\\nnegative conception; there is nothing in our experience that can give\\r\\nit a filling, for our experience is only of phenomena.  The reader will\\r\\nfind an unmistakable echo of this doctrine in Herbert Spencer\\'s\\r\\ndoctrine of the \"Unknowable\" and its \"manifestations.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Berkeley had called all the things we immediately perceive\\r\\n_ideas_.  As we have seen, he distinguished between \"ideas of sense\"\\r\\nand \"ideas of memory and imagination.\"  Hume preferred to give to these\\r\\ntwo classes different names--he called the first _impressions_ and the\\r\\nsecond _ideas_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe associations of the word \"impression\" are not to be mistaken.\\r\\nLocke had taught that between ideas in the memory and genuine\\r\\nsensations there is the difference that the latter are due to the\\r\\n\"brisk acting\" of objects without us.  Objects impress us, and we have\\r\\nsensations or impressions.  To be sure, Hume, after employing the word\\r\\n\"impression,\" goes on to argue that we have no evidence that there are\\r\\nexternal objects, which cause impressions.  But he retains the word\\r\\n\"impression,\" nevertheless, and his use of it perceptibly colors his\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Kant\\'s distinction between phenomena and noumena we have the lineal\\r\\ndescendant of the old distinction between the circle of our ideas and\\r\\nthe something outside of them that causes them and of which they are\\r\\nsupposed to give information.  Hume said we have no reason to believe\\r\\nsuch a thing exists, but are impelled by our nature to believe in it.\\r\\nKant is not so much concerned to prove the nonexistence of noumena,\\r\\nthings-in-themselves, as he is to prove that the very conception is an\\r\\nempty one.  His reasonings seem to result in the conclusion that we can\\r\\nmake no intelligible statement about things so cut off from our\\r\\nexperience as noumena are supposed to be; and one would imagine that he\\r\\nwould have felt impelled to go on to the frank declaration that we have\\r\\nno reason to believe in noumena at all, and had better throw away\\r\\naltogether so meaningless and useless a notion.  But he was a\\r\\nconservative creature, and he did not go quite so far.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far there is little choice between Kant and Hume.  Certainly the\\r\\nformer does not appear to have rehabilitated the external world which\\r\\nhad suffered from the assaults of his predecessors.  What important\\r\\ndifference is there between his doctrine and that of the man whose\\r\\nskeptical tendencies he wished to combat?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difference is this: Descartes and Locke had accounted for our\\r\\nknowledge of things by maintaining that things act upon us, and make an\\r\\nimpression or sensation--that their action, so to speak, begets ideas.\\r\\nThis is a very ancient doctrine as well as a very modern one; it is the\\r\\ndoctrine that most men find reasonable even before they devote\\r\\nthemselves to the study of philosophy.  The totality of such\\r\\nimpressions received from the external world, they are accustomed to\\r\\nregard as our _experience_ of external things; and they are inclined to\\r\\nthink that any knowledge of external things not founded upon experience\\r\\ncan hardly deserve the name of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Hume, when he cast doubt upon the existence of external things,\\r\\ndid not, as I have said above, divest himself of the suggestions of the\\r\\nword \"impression.\"  He insists strenuously that all our knowledge is\\r\\nfounded upon experience; and he holds that no experience can give us\\r\\nknowledge that is necessary and universal.  We know things as they are\\r\\nrevealed to us in our experience; but who can guarantee that we may not\\r\\nhave new experiences of a quite different kind, and which flatly\\r\\ncontradict the notions which we have so far attained of what is\\r\\npossible and impossible, true and untrue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is here that Kant takes issue with Hume.  A survey of our knowledge\\r\\nmakes clear, he thinks, that we are in the possession of a great deal\\r\\nof information that is not of the unsatisfactory kind that, according\\r\\nto Hume, all our knowledge of things must be.  There, for example, are\\r\\nall the truths of mathematics.  When we enunciate a truth regarding the\\r\\nrelations of the lines and angles of a triangle, we are not merely\\r\\nunfolding in the predicate of our proposition what was implicitly\\r\\ncontained in the subject.  There are propositions that do no more than\\r\\nthis; they are _analytical_, _i.e._ they merely analyze the subject.\\r\\nThus, when we say: Man is a rational animal, we may merely be defining\\r\\nthe word \"man\"--unpacking it, so to speak.  But a _synthetic_ judgment\\r\\nis one in which the predicate is not contained in the subject; it adds\\r\\nto one\\'s information.  The mathematical truths are of this character.\\r\\nSo also is the truth that everything that happens must have a cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo we connect things with one another in this way merely because we\\r\\nhave had _experience_ that they are thus connected?  Is it because they\\r\\nare _given_ to us connected in this way?  That cannot be the case, Kant\\r\\nargues, for what is taken up as mere experienced act cannot be known as\\r\\nuniversally and necessarily true.  We perceive that these things _must_\\r\\nbe so connected.  How shall we explain this necessity?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can only explain it, said Kant, in this way: We must assume that\\r\\nwhat is given us from without is merely the raw material of sensation,\\r\\nthe _matter_ of our experience; and that the ordering of this matter,\\r\\nthe arranging it into a world of phenomena, the furnishing of _form_,\\r\\nis the work of the mind.  Thus, we must think of space, time,\\r\\ncausality, and of all other relations which obtain between the elements\\r\\nof our experience, as due to the nature of the mind.  It perceives the\\r\\nworld of phenomena that it does, because it _constructs_ that world.\\r\\nIts knowledge of things is stable and dependable because it cannot know\\r\\nany phenomenon which does not conform to its laws.  The water poured\\r\\ninto a cup must take the shape of the cup; and the raw materials poured\\r\\ninto a mind must take the form of an orderly world, spread out in space\\r\\nand time.\\r\\n\\r\\nKant thought that with this turn he had placed human knowledge upon a\\r\\nsatisfactory basis, and had, at the same time, indicated the\\r\\nlimitations of human knowledge.  If the world we perceive is a world\\r\\nwhich we make; if the forms of thought furnished by the mind have no\\r\\nother function than the ordering of the materials furnished by sense;\\r\\nthen what can we say of that which may be beyond phenomena?  What of\\r\\n_noumena_?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems clear that, on Kant\\'s principles, we ought not to be able to\\r\\nsay anything whatever of _noumena_.  To say that such may exist appears\\r\\nabsurd.  All conceivable connection between them and existing things as\\r\\nwe know them is cut off.  We cannot think of a noumenon as a\\r\\n_substance_, for the notions of substance and quality have been\\r\\ndeclared to be only a scheme for the ordering of phenomena.  Nor can we\\r\\nthink of one as a cause of the sensations that we unite into a world,\\r\\nfor just the same reason.  We are shut up logically to the world of\\r\\nphenomena, and that world of phenomena is, after all, the successor of\\r\\nthe world of ideas advocated by Berkeley.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not the place to discuss at length the value of Kant\\'s\\r\\ncontribution to philosophy.[3]  There is something terrifying in the\\r\\nprodigious length at which it seems possible for men to discuss it.\\r\\nKant called his doctrine \"Criticism,\" because it undertook to establish\\r\\nthe nature and limits of our knowledge.  By some he has been hailed as\\r\\na great enlightener, and by others he has been accused of being as\\r\\ndogmatic in his assumptions as those whom he disapproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one thing he certainly has accomplished.  He has made the words\\r\\n\"phenomena\" and \"noumena\" familiar to us all, and he has induced a vast\\r\\nnumber of men to accept it as established fact that it is not worth\\r\\nwhile to try to extend our knowledge beyond phenomena.  One sees his\\r\\ninfluence in the writings of men who differ most widely from one\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Essay,\" Book IV, Chapter XI, section 7.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] \"An Inquiry into the Human Mind,\" Chapter V, section 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] The reader will find a criticism of the Critical Philosophy in\\r\\nChapter XV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII\\r\\n\\r\\nREALISM AND IDEALISM\\r\\n\\r\\n52. REALISM.--The plain man is a realist.  That is to say, he believes\\r\\nin a world which is not to be identified with his own ideas or those of\\r\\nany other mind.  At the same time, as we have seen (section 12), the\\r\\ndistinction between the mind and the world is by no means clear to him.\\r\\nIt is not difficult, by judicious questioning, to set his feet upon the\\r\\nslippery descent that shoots a man into idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vague realism of the plain man may be called _Na\\xc3\\xafve_ or\\r\\n_Unreflective Realism_.  It has been called by some _Natural Realism_,\\r\\nbut the latter term is an unfortunate one.  It is, of course, natural\\r\\nfor the unreflective man to be unreflective, but, on the other hand, it\\r\\nis also natural for the reflective man to be reflective.  Besides, in\\r\\ndubbing any doctrine \"natural,\" we are apt to assume that doctrines\\r\\ncontrasted with it may properly be called \"unnatural\" or \"artificial.\"\\r\\nIt is an ancient rhetorical device, to obtain sympathy for a cause in\\r\\nwhich one may happen to be interested by giving it a taking name; but\\r\\nit is a device frowned upon by logic and by good sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne kind of realism is, then, na\\xc3\\xafve realism.  It is the position from\\r\\nwhich we all set out, when we begin to reflect upon the system of\\r\\nthings.  It is the position to which some try to come back, when their\\r\\nreflections appear to be leading them into strange or unwelcome paths.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen how Thomas Reid (section 50) recoiled from the conclusions\\r\\nto which the reasonings of the philosophers had brought him, and tried\\r\\nto return to the position of the plain man.  The attempt was a failure,\\r\\nand was necessarily a failure, for Reid tried to come back to the\\r\\nposition of the plain man _and still be a philosopher_.  He tried to\\r\\nlive in a cloud and, nevertheless, to see clearly--a task not easy to\\r\\naccomplish.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should be remarked, however, that he tried, at least, to insist that\\r\\nwe know the external world _directly_.  We may divide realists into two\\r\\nbroad classes, those who hold to this view, and those who maintain that\\r\\nwe know it only indirectly and through our ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plain man belongs, of course, to the first class, if it is just to\\r\\nspeak of a man who says inconsistent things as being wholly in any one\\r\\nclass.  Certainly he is willing to assert that the ground upon which he\\r\\nstands and the staff in his hand are perceived by him directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are compelled to recognize that there are subdivisions in this\\r\\nfirst class of realists.  Reid tried to place himself beside the plain\\r\\nman and failed to do so.  Hamilton (section 50) tried also, and he is\\r\\nnot to be classed precisely either with the plain man or with Reid.  He\\r\\ninforms us that the object as it appears to us is a composite something\\r\\nto the building up of which the knowing mind contributes its share, the\\r\\nmedium through which the object is perceived its share, and the object\\r\\nin itself its share.  He suggests, by way of illustration, that the\\r\\nexternal object may contribute one third.  This seems to make, at\\r\\nleast, _something_ external directly known.  But, on the other hand, he\\r\\nmaintains that the mind knows immediately only what is in immediate\\r\\ncontact with the bodily organ--with the eyes, with the hands, etc.; and\\r\\nhe believes it knows this immediately because it is actually present in\\r\\nall parts of the body.  And, further, in distinguishing as he does\\r\\nbetween existence \"as it is in itself\" and existence \"as it is revealed\\r\\nto us,\" and in shutting us up to the latter, he seems to rob us even of\\r\\nthe modicum of externality that he has granted us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have already mentioned Herbert Spencer (section 50) as a man not\\r\\nwithout sympathy for the attempt to rehabilitate the external world.\\r\\nHe is very severe with the \"insanities\" of idealism.  He is not willing\\r\\neven to take the first step toward it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe writes:[1] \"The postulate with which metaphysical reasoning sets out\\r\\nis that we are primarily conscious only of our sensations--that we\\r\\ncertainly know we have these, and that if there be anything beyond\\r\\nthese serving as cause for them, it can be known only by inference from\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I shall give much surprise to the metaphysical reader if I call in\\r\\nquestion this postulate; and the surprise will rise into astonishment\\r\\nif I distinctly deny it.  Yet I must do this.  Limiting the proposition\\r\\nto those epiperipheral feelings produced in us by external objects (for\\r\\nthese are alone in question), I see no alternative but to affirm that\\r\\nthe thing primarily known is not that a sensation has been experienced,\\r\\nbut that there exists an outer object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this, the outer object is not known through an inference;\\r\\nit is known directly.  But do not be in haste to class Spencer with the\\r\\nplain man, or with Reid.  Listen to a citation once before made\\r\\n(section 22), but worth repeating in this connection: \"When we are\\r\\ntaught that a piece of matter, regarded by us as existing externally,\\r\\ncannot be really known, but that we can know only certain impressions\\r\\nproduced on us, we are yet, by the relativity of thought, compelled to\\r\\nthink of these in relation to a cause--the notion of a real existence\\r\\nwhich generated these impressions becomes nascent.  If it be proved\\r\\nthat every notion of a real existence which we can frame is\\r\\ninconsistent with itself,--that matter, however conceived by us, cannot\\r\\nbe matter as it actually is,--our conception, though transfigured, is\\r\\nnot destroyed: there remains the sense of reality, dissociated as far\\r\\nas possible from those special forms under which it was before\\r\\nrepresented in thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to place the two extracts side by side.  In the one,\\r\\nwe are told that we do not know external objects by an inference from\\r\\nour sensations; in the other we are taught that the piece of matter\\r\\nwhich we regard as existing externally cannot be really known; that we\\r\\ncan know only certain impressions produced on us, and must refer them\\r\\nto a cause; that this cause cannot be what we think it.  It is\\r\\ndifficult for the man who reads such statements not to forget that\\r\\nSpencer regarded himself as a realist who held to a direct knowledge of\\r\\nsomething external.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are, as it is evident, many sorts of realists that may be\\r\\ngathered into the first class mentioned above--men who, however\\r\\ninconsistent they may be, try, at least, to maintain that our knowledge\\r\\nof the external world is a direct one.  And it is equally true that\\r\\nthere are various sorts of realists that may be put into the second\\r\\nclass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese men have been called _Hypothetical Realists_.  In the last\\r\\nchapter it was pointed out that Descartes and Locke belong to this\\r\\nclass.  Both of these men believed in an external world, but believed\\r\\nthat its existence is a thing to be inferred.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when a man has persuaded himself that the mind can know directly\\r\\nonly its own ideas, and must infer the world which they are supposed to\\r\\nrepresent, he may conceive of that external world in three different\\r\\nways.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) He may believe that what corresponds to his idea of a material\\r\\nobject, for example, an apple, is in very many respects like the idea\\r\\nin his mind.  Thus, he may believe that the odor, taste, color,\\r\\nhardness, etc., that he perceives directly, or as ideas, have\\r\\ncorresponding to them real external odor, taste, color, hardness, etc.\\r\\nIt is not easy for a man to hold to this position, for a very little\\r\\nreflection seems to make it untenable; but it is theoretically possible\\r\\nfor one to take it, and probably many persons have inclined to the view\\r\\nwhen they have first been tempted to believe that the mind perceives\\r\\ndirectly only its ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) He may believe that such things as colors, tastes, and odors cannot\\r\\nbe qualities of external bodies at all, but are only effects, produced\\r\\nupon our minds by something very different in kind.  We seem to\\r\\nperceive bodies, he may argue, to be colored, to have taste, and to be\\r\\nodorous; but what we thus perceive is not the external thing; the\\r\\nexternal thing that produces these appearances cannot be regarded as\\r\\nhaving anything more than \"solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest,\\r\\nand number.\"  Thus did Locke reason.  To him the external world as it\\r\\nreally exists, is, so to speak, a paler copy of the external world as\\r\\nwe seem to perceive it.  It is a world with fewer qualities, but,\\r\\nstill, a world with qualities of some kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) But one may go farther than this.  One may say: How can I know that\\r\\neven the extension, number, and motion of the things which I directly\\r\\nperceive have corresponding to them extension, number, and motion, in\\r\\nan outer world?  If what is not colored can cause me to perceive color,\\r\\nwhy may not that which is not extended cause me to perceive extension?\\r\\nAnd, moved by such reflections, one may maintain that there exists\\r\\noutside of us that which we can only characterize as an Unknown Cause,\\r\\na Reality which we cannot more nearly define.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last position resembles very closely one side of Spencer\\'s\\r\\ndoctrine--that represented in the last of the two citations, as the\\r\\nreader can easily see.  It is the position of the follower of Immanuel\\r\\nKant who has not yet repudiated the noumenon or thing-in-itself\\r\\ndiscussed in the last chapter (section 51).\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not concerned to defend any one of the varieties of Direct or of\\r\\nHypothetical Realism portrayed above.  But I wish to point out that\\r\\nthey all have some sort of claim to the title _Realism_, and to remind\\r\\nthe reader that, when we call a man a realist, we do not do very much\\r\\nin the way of defining his position.  I may add that the account of the\\r\\nexternal world contained in Chapter IV is a sort of realism also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this last variety, which I advocate, _must_ be classified, let it be\\r\\nplaced in the first broad class, for it teaches that we know the\\r\\nexternal world directly.  But I sincerely hope that it will not be\\r\\njudged wholly by the company it keeps, and that no one will assign to\\r\\nit either virtues or defects to which it can lay no just claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore leaving the subject of realism it is right that I should utter a\\r\\nnote of warning touching one very common source of error.  It is\\r\\nfatally easy for men to be misled by the names which are applied to\\r\\nthings.  Sir William Hamilton invented for a certain type of\\r\\nmetaphysical doctrine the offensive epithet \"nihilism.\"  It is a type\\r\\nwhich appeals to many inoffensive and pious men at the present day,\\r\\nsome of whom prefer to call themselves idealists.  Many have been\\r\\ninduced to become \"free-willists\" because the name has suggested to\\r\\nthem a proper regard for that freedom which is justly dear to all men.\\r\\nWe can scarcely approach with an open mind an account of ideas and\\r\\nsensations which we hear described as \"sensationalism,\" or worse yet,\\r\\nas \"sensualism.\"  When a given type of philosophy is set down as\\r\\n\"dogmatism,\" we involuntarily feel a prejudice against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who reads as reflectively as he should will soon find out that\\r\\nphilosophers \"call names\" much as other men do, and that one should\\r\\nalways be on one\\'s guard.  \"Every form of phenomenalism,\" asseverated a\\r\\nlearned and energetic old gentleman, who for many years occupied a\\r\\nchair in one of our leading institutions of learning, \"necessarily\\r\\nleads to atheism.\"  He inspired a considerable number of students with\\r\\nsuch a horror for \"phenomenalism\" that they never took pains to find\\r\\nout what it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mention these things in this connection, because I suspect that not a\\r\\nfew in our own day are unduly influenced by the associations which\\r\\ncling to the words \"realism\" and \"idealism.\"  Realism in literature, as\\r\\nmany persons understand it, means the degradation of literature to the\\r\\nportrayal of what is coarse and degrading, in a coarse and offensive\\r\\nway.  Realism in painting often means the laborious representation upon\\r\\ncanvas of things from which we would gladly avert our eyes if we met\\r\\nthem in real life.  With the word \"idealism,\" on the other hand, we are\\r\\napt to connect the possession of ideals, a regard for what is best and\\r\\nnoblest in life and literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader must have seen that realism in the philosophic sense of the\\r\\nword has nothing whatever to do with realism in the senses just\\r\\nmentioned.  The word is given a special meaning, and it is a weakness\\r\\nto allow associations drawn from other senses of the word to color our\\r\\njudgment when we use it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it should be carefully held in view that the word \"idealism\" is\\r\\ngiven a special sense when it is used to indicate a type of doctrine\\r\\ncontrasted with the doctrine of the realist.  Some forms of\\r\\nphilosophical idealism have undoubtedly been inspiring; but some have\\r\\nbeen, and are, far from inspiring.  They should not be allowed to\\r\\nposture as saints merely because they are cloaked with an ambiguous\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\n53. IDEALISM.--Idealism we may broadly define as the doctrine that all\\r\\nexistence is mental existence.  So far from regarding the external\\r\\nworld as beyond and independent of mind, it maintains that it can have\\r\\nits being only in consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen (section 49) how men were led to take the step to\\r\\nidealism.  It is not a step which the plain man is impelled to take\\r\\nwithout preparation.  To say that the real world of things in which we\\r\\nperceive ourselves to live and move is a something that exists only in\\r\\nthe mind strikes him as little better than insane.  He who becomes an\\r\\nidealist usually does so, I think, after weighing the arguments\\r\\npresented by the hypothetical realist, and finding that they seem to\\r\\ncarry one farther than the latter appears to recognize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe type of idealism represented by Berkeley has been called\\r\\n_Subjective Idealism_.  Ordinarily our use of the words \"subjective\"\\r\\nand \"objective\" is to call attention to the distinction between what\\r\\nbelongs to the mind and what belongs to the external order of things.\\r\\nMy sensations are subjective, they are referred to my mind, and it is\\r\\nassumed that they can have no existence except in my mind; the\\r\\nqualities of things are regarded as objective, that is, it is commonly\\r\\nbelieved that they exist independently of my perception of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, when a man becomes an idealist, he cannot keep just this\\r\\ndistinction.  The question may, then, fairly be raised: How can he be a\\r\\n_subjective idealist_?  Has not the word \"subjective\" lost its\\r\\nsignificance?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this one has to answer: It has, and it has not.  The man who, with\\r\\nstrict consistency, makes the desk at which he sits as much his \"idea\"\\r\\nas is the pain in his finger or his memory of yesterday, cannot keep\\r\\nhold of the distinction of subjective and objective.  But men are not\\r\\nalways as consistent as this.  Remember the illustration of the\\r\\n\"telephone exchange\" (section 14).  The mind is represented as situated\\r\\nat the brain terminals of the sensory nerves; and then brain, nerves,\\r\\nand all else are turned into ideas in this mind, which are merely\\r\\n\"projected outwards.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in placing the mind at a definite location in the world, and\\r\\ncontrasting it with the world, we retain the distinction between\\r\\nsubjective and objective--what is in the mind can be distinguished from\\r\\nwhat is beyond it.  On the other hand, in making the whole system of\\r\\nexternal things a complex of ideas in the mind, we become idealists,\\r\\nand repudiate realism.  The position is an inconsistent one, of course,\\r\\nbut it is possible for men to take it, for men have taken it often\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idealism of Professor Pearson (section 14) is more palpably\\r\\nsubjective than that of Berkeley, for the latter never puts the mind in\\r\\na \"telephone exchange.\"  Nevertheless, he names the objects of sense,\\r\\nwhich other men call material things, \"ideas,\" and he evidently\\r\\nassimilates them to what we commonly call ideas and contrast with\\r\\nthings.  Moreover, he holds them in some of the contempt which men\\r\\nreserve for \"mere ideas,\" for he believes that idolaters might be\\r\\ninduced to give over worshiping the heavenly bodies could they be\\r\\npersuaded that these are nothing more than their own ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the various forms of subjective idealism it is usual to contrast\\r\\nthe doctrine of _Objective Idealism_.  This does not maintain that the\\r\\nworld which I perceive is my \"idea\"; it maintains that the world is\\r\\n\"idea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rather a nice question, and one which no man should decide\\r\\nwithout a careful examination of the whole matter, whether we have any\\r\\nright to retain the word \"idea\" when we have rubbed out the distinction\\r\\nwhich is usually drawn between ideas and external things.  If we\\r\\nmaintain that all men are always necessarily selfish, we stretch the\\r\\nmeaning of the word quite beyond what is customary, and selfishness\\r\\nbecomes a thing we have no reason to disapprove, since it characterizes\\r\\nsaint and sinner alike.  Similarly, if we decide to name \"idea,\" not\\r\\nonly what the plain man and the realist admit to have a right to that\\r\\nname, but also the great system which these men call an external\\r\\nmaterial world, it seems right to ask; Why use the word \"idea\" at all?\\r\\nWhat does it serve to indicate?  Not a distinction, surely, for the\\r\\nword seems to be applicable to all things without distinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch considerations as these lead me to object to the expression\\r\\n\"objective idealism\": if the doctrine is really _objective_, _i.e._ if\\r\\nit recognizes a system of things different and distinct from what men\\r\\ncommonly call ideas, it scarcely seems to have a right to the title\\r\\n_idealism_; and if it is really _idealism_, and does not rob the word\\r\\nidea of all significance, it can scarcely be _objective_ in any proper\\r\\nsense of the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nManifestly, there is need of a very careful analysis of the meaning of\\r\\nthe word \"idea,\" and of the proper significance of the terms\\r\\n\"subjective\" and \"objective,\" if error is to be avoided and language\\r\\nused soberly and accurately.  Those who are not in sympathy with the\\r\\ndoctrine of the objective idealists think that in such careful analysis\\r\\nand accurate statement they are rather conspicuously lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe think of Hegel (1770-1831) as the typical objective idealist.  It is\\r\\nnot easy to give an accurate account of his doctrine, for he is far\\r\\nfrom a clear writer, and he has made it possible for his many admirers\\r\\nto understand him in many ways.  But he seems to have accepted the\\r\\nsystem of things that most men call the real external world, and to\\r\\nhave regarded it as the Divine Reason in its self-development.  And\\r\\nmost of those whom we would to-day be inclined to gather together under\\r\\nthe title of objective idealists appear to have been much influenced,\\r\\ndirectly or indirectly, by his philosophy.  There are, however, great\\r\\ndifferences of opinion among them, and no man should be made\\r\\nresponsible for the opinions of the class as a class.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said a few pages back that some forms of idealism are inspiring,\\r\\nand that some are not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBishop Berkeley called the objects of sense ideas.  He regarded all\\r\\nideas as inactive, and thought that all changes in ideas--and this\\r\\nincludes all the changes that take place in nature--must be referred to\\r\\nthe activity of minds.  Some of those changes he could refer to finite\\r\\nminds, his own and others.  Most of them he could not, and he felt\\r\\nimpelled to refer them to a Divine Mind.  Hence, the world became to\\r\\nhim a constant revelation of God; and he uses the word \"God\" in no\\r\\nequivocal sense.  It does not signify to him the system of things as a\\r\\nwhole, or an Unknowable, or anything of the sort.  It signifies a\\r\\nspirit akin to his own, but without its limitations.  He writes:[2]--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A human spirit or person is not perceived by sense, as not being an\\r\\nidea; when, therefore, we see the color, size, figure, and motions of a\\r\\nman, we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited in our own\\r\\nminds; and these being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct\\r\\ncollections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and\\r\\ncreated spirits like ourselves.  Hence, it is plain we do not see a\\r\\nman,--if by _man_ is meant that which lives, moves, perceives, and\\r\\nthinks as we do,--but only such a certain collection of ideas as\\r\\ndirects us to think there is a distinct principle of thought and\\r\\nmotion, like to ourselves, accompanying and represented by it.  And\\r\\nafter the same manner we see God; all the difference is that, whereas\\r\\nsome one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denotes a particular\\r\\nhuman mind, whithersoever we direct our view, we do at all times and in\\r\\nall places perceive manifest tokens of the Divinity--everything we see,\\r\\nhear, feel, or any wise perceive by sense, being a sign or effect of\\r\\nthe power of God; as is our perception of those very motions which are\\r\\nproduced by men.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Berkeley\\'s view of the world as a constant revelation of God, many\\r\\nmen will sympathize who have little liking for his idealism as\\r\\nidealism.  They may criticise in detail his arguments to prove the\\r\\nnonexistence of a genuinely external world, but they will be ready to\\r\\nadmit that his doctrine is an inspiring one in the view that it takes\\r\\nof the world and of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this I wish to contrast the doctrine of another idealist, Mr.\\r\\nBradley, whose work, \"Appearance and Reality,\" has been much discussed\\r\\nin the last few years, in order that the reader may see how widely\\r\\ndifferent forms of idealism may differ from each other, and how absurd\\r\\nit is to praise or blame a man\\'s philosophy merely on the ground that\\r\\nit is idealistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bradley holds that those aspects of our experience which we are\\r\\naccustomed to regard as real--qualities of things, the relations\\r\\nbetween things, the things themselves, space, time, motion, causation,\\r\\nactivity, the self--turn out when carefully examined to be\\r\\nself-contradictory and absurd.  They are not real; they are\\r\\nunrealities, mere appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these appearances exist, and, hence, must belong to reality.  This\\r\\nreality must be sentient, for \"there is no being or fact outside of\\r\\nthat which is commonly called psychical existence.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what is this reality with which appearances--the whole world of\\r\\nthings which seem to be given in our experience--are contrasted?  Mr.\\r\\nBradley calls it the Absolute, and indicates that it is what other men\\r\\nrecognize as the Deity.  How shall we conceive it?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are told that we are to conceive it as consisting of the contents of\\r\\nfinite minds, or \"centers of experience,\" subjected to \"an\\r\\nall-pervasive transfusion with a reblending of all material.\"  In the\\r\\nAbsolute, finite things are \"transmuted\" and lose \"their individual\\r\\nnatures.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does this mean in plain language?  It means that there are many\\r\\nfinite minds of a higher and of a lower order, \"centers of experience,\"\\r\\nand that the contents of these are unreal appearances.  There is not a\\r\\nGod or Absolute outside of and distinct from these, but rather one that\\r\\nin some sense _is their reality_.  This mass of unrealities transfused\\r\\nand transmuted so that no one of them retains its individual nature is\\r\\nthe Absolute.  That is to say, time must become indistinguishable from\\r\\nspace, space from motion, motion from the self, the self from the\\r\\nqualities of things, etc., before they are fit to become constituents\\r\\nof the Absolute and to be regarded as real.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the reader has seen, this Absolute has nothing in common with the\\r\\nGod in which Berkeley believed, and in which the plain man usually\\r\\nbelieves.  It is the night in which all cats are gray, and there\\r\\nappears to be no reason why any one should harbor toward it the least\\r\\nsentiment of awe or veneration.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether such reasonings as Mr. Bradley\\'s should be accepted as valid or\\r\\nshould not, must be decided after a careful examination into the\\r\\nfoundations upon which they rest and the consistency with which\\r\\ninferences are drawn from premises.  I do not wish to prejudge the\\r\\nmatter.  But it is worth while to set forth the conclusions at which he\\r\\narrives, that it may be clearly realized that the associations which\\r\\noften hang about the word \"idealism\" should be carefully stripped away\\r\\nwhen we are forming our estimate of this or that philosophical doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Principles of Psychology,\" Part VII, Chapter VI, section 404.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] \"Principles,\" section 148.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV\\r\\n\\r\\nMONISM AND DUALISM\\r\\n\\r\\n54. THE MEANING OF THE WORDS.--In common life men distinguish between\\r\\nminds and material things, thus dividing the things, which taken\\r\\ntogether make up the world as we know it, into two broad classes.  They\\r\\nthink of minds as being very different from material objects, and of\\r\\nthe latter as being very different from minds.  It does not occur to\\r\\nthem to find in the one class room for the other, nor does it occur to\\r\\nthem to think of both classes as \"manifestations\" or \"aspects\" of some\\r\\none \"underlying reality.\"  In other words, the plain man to-day is a\\r\\n_Dualist_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last chapter (section 52) I have called him a Na\\xc3\\xafve Realist; and\\r\\nhere I shall call him a _Na\\xc3\\xafve Dualist_, for a man may regard mind and\\r\\nmatter as quite distinct kinds of things, without trying to elevate his\\r\\nopinion, through reflection, into a philosophical doctrine.  The\\r\\nreflective man may stand by the opinion of the plain man, merely trying\\r\\nto make less vague and indefinite the notions of matter and of mind.\\r\\nHe then becomes a _Philosophical Dualist_.  There are several varieties\\r\\nof this doctrine, and I shall consider them a little later (section 58).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is possible for one to be less profoundly impressed by the\\r\\ndifferences which characterize matter and mind.  One may feel inclined\\r\\nto refer mental phenomena to matter, and to deny them the prominence\\r\\naccorded them by the dualist.  On the other hand, one may be led by\\r\\none\\'s reflections to resolve material objects into mere ideas, and to\\r\\nclaim that they can have no existence except in a mind.  Finally, it is\\r\\npossible to hold that both minds and material things, as we know them,\\r\\nare only manifestations, phenomena, and that they must be referred to\\r\\nan ulterior \"reality\" or \"substance.\"  One may claim that they are\\r\\n\"aspects\" of the one reality, which is neither matter nor mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese doctrines are different forms of _Monism_.  In whatever else they\\r\\ndiffer from one another, they agree in maintaining that the universe\\r\\ndoes not contain two kinds of things fundamentally different.  Out of\\r\\nthe duality of things as it seems to be revealed to the plain man they\\r\\ntry to make some kind of a unity.\\r\\n\\r\\n35. MATERIALISM.--The first of the forms of monism above mentioned is\\r\\n_Materialism_.  It is not a doctrine to which the first impulse of the\\r\\nplain man leads him at the present time.  Even those who have done no\\r\\nreading in philosophy have inherited many of their ways of looking at\\r\\nthings from the thinkers who lived in the ages past, and whose opinions\\r\\nhave become the common property of civilized men.  For more than two\\r\\nthousand years the world and the mind have been discussed, and it is\\r\\nimpossible for any of us to escape from the influence of those\\r\\ndiscussions and to look at things with the primitive simplicity of the\\r\\nwholly untutored.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not always so.  There was a time when men who were not\\r\\nsavages, but possessed great intellectual vigor and much cultivation,\\r\\nfound it easy and natural to be materialists.  This I have spoken of\\r\\nbefore (section 30), but it will repay us to take up again a little\\r\\nmore at length the clearest of the ancient forms of materialism, that\\r\\nof the Atomists, and to see what may be said for and against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocritus of Abdera taught that nothing exists except atoms and empty\\r\\nspace.  The atoms, he maintained, differ from one another in size,\\r\\nshape, and position.  In other respects they are alike.  They have\\r\\nalways been in motion.  Perhaps he conceived of that motion as\\r\\noriginally a fall through space, but there seems to be uncertainty upon\\r\\nthis point.  However, the atoms in motion collide with one another, and\\r\\nthese collisions result in mechanical combinations from which spring\\r\\ninto being world-systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this doctrine, nothing comes from nothing, and nothing can\\r\\nbecome nonexistent.  All the changes which have ever taken place in the\\r\\nworld are only changes in the position of material particles--they are\\r\\nregroupings of atoms.  We cannot directly perceive them to be such, for\\r\\nour senses are too dull to make such fine observations, but our reason\\r\\ntells us that such is the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere, in such a world as this, is there room for mind, and what can we\\r\\nmean by mind?  Democritus finds a place for mind by conceiving it to\\r\\nconsist of fine, smooth, round atoms, which are the same as the atoms\\r\\nwhich constitute fire.  These are distributed through the whole body,\\r\\nand lie among the other atoms which compose it.  They are inhaled with\\r\\nand exhaled into the outer air.  While they are in the body their\\r\\nfunctions are different according as they are located in this organ or\\r\\nin that.  In the brain they give rise to thought, in the heart to\\r\\nanger, and in the liver to desire.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose no one would care, at the present time, to become a\\r\\nDemocritean.  The \"Reason,\" which tells us that the mind consists of\\r\\nfine, round atoms, appears to have nothing but its bare word to offer\\r\\nus.  But, apart from this, a peculiar difficulty seems to face us; even\\r\\nsupposing there are atoms of fire in the brain, the heart, and the\\r\\nliver, what are the _thought_, _anger_, and _desire_, of which mention\\r\\nis made?\\r\\n\\r\\nShall we conceive of these last as atoms, as void space, or as the\\r\\nmotion of atoms?  There really seems to be no place in the world for\\r\\nthem, and _these are the mind so far as the mind appears to be\\r\\nrevealed_--they are _mental phenomena_.  It does not seem that they are\\r\\nto be identified with anything that the Atomistic doctrine admits as\\r\\nexisting.  They are simply overlooked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the modern materialism more satisfactory?  About half a century ago\\r\\nthere was in the scientific world something like a revival of\\r\\nmaterialistic thinking.  It did not occur to any one to maintain that\\r\\nthe mind consists of fine atoms disseminated through the body, but\\r\\nstatements almost as crude were made.  It was said, for example, that\\r\\nthe brain secretes thought as the liver secretes bile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems a gratuitous labor to criticise such statements as these in\\r\\ndetail.  There are no glands the secretions of which are not as\\r\\nunequivocally material as are the glands themselves.  This means that\\r\\nsuch secretions can be captured and analyzed; the chemical elements of\\r\\nwhich they are composed can be enumerated.  They are open to inspection\\r\\nin precisely the same way as are the glands which secrete them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes it seem reasonable to maintain that thoughts and feelings are\\r\\nrelated to brains in this way?  Does the chemist ever dream of\\r\\ncollecting them in a test tube, and of drawing up for us a list of\\r\\ntheir constituent elements?  When the brain is active, there are, to be\\r\\nsure, certain material products which pass into the blood and are\\r\\nfinally eliminated from the body; but among these products no one would\\r\\nbe more surprised than the materialist to discover pains and pleasures,\\r\\nmemories and anticipations, desires and volitions.  This talk of\\r\\nthought as a \"secretion\" we can afford to set aside.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor need we take much more seriously the seemingly more sober statement\\r\\nthat thought is a \"function\" of the brain.  There is, of course, a\\r\\nsense in which we all admit the statement; minds are not disembodied,\\r\\nand we have reason to believe that mind and brain are most intimately\\r\\nrelated.  But the word \"function\" is used in a very broad and loose\\r\\nsense when it serves to indicate this relation; and one may employ it\\r\\nin this way without being a materialist at all.  In a stricter sense of\\r\\nthe word, the brain has no functions that may not be conceived as\\r\\nmechanical changes,--as the motion of atoms in space,--and to identify\\r\\nmental phenomena with these is inexcusable.  It is not theoretically\\r\\ninconceivable that, with finer senses, we might directly perceive the\\r\\nmotions of the atoms in another man\\'s brain; it is inconceivable that\\r\\nwe should thus directly perceive his melancholy or his joy; they belong\\r\\nto another world.\\r\\n\\r\\n56. SPIRITUALISM.--The name _Spiritualism_ is sometimes given to the\\r\\ndoctrine that there is no existence which we may not properly call mind\\r\\nor spirit.  It errs in the one direction as materialism errs in the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne must not confound with this doctrine that very different one,\\r\\nSpiritism, which teaches that a certain favored class of persons called\\r\\nmediums may bring back the spirits of the departed and enable us to\\r\\nhold communication with them.  Such beliefs have always existed among\\r\\nthe common people, but they have rarely interested philosophers.  I\\r\\nshall have nothing to say of them in this book.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been various kinds of spiritualists.  The name may be\\r\\napplied to the idealists, from Berkeley down to those of our day; at\\r\\nsome of the varieties of their doctrine we have taken a glance\\r\\n(sections 49, 53).  To these we need not recur; but there is one type\\r\\nof spiritualistic doctrine which is much discussed at the present day\\r\\nand which appears to appeal strongly to a number of scientific men.  We\\r\\nmust consider it for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have examined Professor Clifford\\'s doctrine of Mind-stuff (section\\r\\n43).  Clifford maintained that all the material things we perceive are\\r\\nour perceptions--they are in our consciousness, and are not properly\\r\\nexternal at all.  But, believing, as he did, that all nature is\\r\\nanimated, he held that every material thing, every perception, may be\\r\\ntaken as a revelation of something not in our consciousness, of a mind\\r\\nor, at least, of a certain amount of mind-stuff.  How shall we conceive\\r\\nthe relation between what is in our mind and the something\\r\\ncorresponding to it not in our mind?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must, says Clifford, regard the latter as the _reality_ of which the\\r\\nformer is the _appearance_ or _manifestation_.  \"What I perceive as\\r\\nyour brain is really in itself your consciousness, is You; but then\\r\\nthat which I call your brain, the material fact, is merely my\\r\\nperception.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doctrine is _Panpsychism_, in the form in which it is usually\\r\\nbrought to our attention.  It holds that the only real existences are\\r\\nminds, and that physical phenomena must be regarded as the\\r\\nmanifestations under which these real existences make us aware of their\\r\\npresence.  The term panpsychism may, it is true, be used in a somewhat\\r\\ndifferent sense.  It may be employed merely to indicate the doctrine\\r\\nthat all nature is animated, and without implying a theory as to the\\r\\nrelation between bodies perceived and the minds supposed to accompany\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall we say to panpsychism of the type represented by Clifford?\\r\\nIt is, I think, sufficiently answered in the earlier chapters of this\\r\\nvolume:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) If I call material facts my perceptions, I do an injustice to the\\r\\ndistinction between the physical and the mental (Chapter IV).\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) If I say that all nature is animated, I extend illegitimately the\\r\\nargument for other minds (Chapter X).\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) If I say that mind is the reality of which the brain is the\\r\\nappearance, I misconceive what is meant by the distinction between\\r\\nappearance and reality (Chapter V).\\r\\n\\r\\n57. THE DOCTRINE OF THE ONE SUBSTANCE.--In the seventeenth century\\r\\nDescartes maintained that, although mind and matter may justly be\\r\\nregarded as two substances, yet it should be recognized that they are\\r\\nnot really independent substances in the strictest sense of the word,\\r\\nbut that there is only one substance, in this sense, and mind and\\r\\nmatter are, as it were, its attributes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis thought was that by attribute we mean that which is not\\r\\nindependent, but must be referred to something else; by substance, we\\r\\nmean that which exists independently and is not referred to any other\\r\\nthing.  It seemed to follow that there could be only one substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinoza modified Descartes\\' doctrine in that he refused to regard mind\\r\\nand matter as substances at all.  He made them unequivocally attributes\\r\\nof the one and only substance, which he called God.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought which influenced Spinoza had impressed many minds before\\r\\nhis time, and it has influenced many since.  One need not follow him in\\r\\nnaming the unitary something to which mind and matter are referred\\r\\nsubstance.  One may call it Being, or Reality, or the Unknowable, or\\r\\nEnergy, or the Absolute, or, perhaps, still something else.  The\\r\\ndoctrine has taken many forms, but he who reads with discrimination\\r\\nwill see that the various forms have much in common.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agree in maintaining that matter and mind, as they are revealed in\\r\\nour experience, are not to be regarded as, in the last analysis, two\\r\\ndistinct kinds of thing.  They are, rather, modes or manifestations of\\r\\none and the same thing, and this is not to be confounded with either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who incline to this doctrine take issue with the materialist, who\\r\\nassimilates mental phenomena to physical; and they oppose the idealist,\\r\\nwho assimilates physical phenomena to mental, and calls material things\\r\\n\"ideas.\"  We have no right, they argue, to call that of which ideas and\\r\\nthings are manifestations either mind or matter.  It is to be\\r\\ndistinguished from both.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this doctrine the title of _Monism_ is often appropriated.  In this\\r\\nchapter I have used the term in a broader sense, for both the\\r\\nmaterialist and the spiritualist maintain that there is in the universe\\r\\nbut one kind of thing.  Nevertheless, when we hear a man called a\\r\\nmonist without qualification, we may, perhaps, be justified in\\r\\nassuming, in the absence of further information, that he holds to some\\r\\none of the forms of doctrine indicated above.  There may be no logical\\r\\njustification for thus narrowing the use of the term, but logical\\r\\njustification goes for little in such matters.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious considerations have moved men to become monists in this sense\\r\\nof the word.  Some have been influenced by the assumption--one which\\r\\nmen felt impelled to make early in the history of speculative\\r\\nthought--that the whole universe must be the expression of some unitary\\r\\nprinciple.  A rather different argument is well illustrated in the\\r\\nwritings of Professor H\\xc3\\xb6ffding, a learned and acute writer of our own\\r\\ntime.  It has influenced so many that it is worth while to delay upon\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor H\\xc3\\xb6ffding holds that mental phenomena and physical phenomena\\r\\nmust be regarded as parallel (see Chapter IX), and that we must not\\r\\nconceive of ideas and material things as interacting.  He writes:[1]--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If it is contrary to the doctrine of the persistence of physical\\r\\nenergy to suppose a transition from the one province to the other, and\\r\\nif, nevertheless, the two provinces exist in our experience as\\r\\ndistinct, then the two sets of phenomena must be unfolded\\r\\nsimultaneously, each according to its laws, so that for every\\r\\nphenomenon in the world of consciousness there is a corresponding\\r\\nphenomenon in the world of matter, and conversely (so far as there is\\r\\nreason to suppose that conscious life is correlated with material\\r\\nphenomena).  The parallels already drawn point directly to such a\\r\\nrelation; it would be an amazing accident, if, while the characteristic\\r\\nmarks repeated themselves in this way, there were not at the foundation\\r\\nan inner connection.  Both the _parallelism_ and the _proportionality_\\r\\nbetween the activity of consciousness and cerebral activity point to an\\r\\n_identity_ at bottom.  The difference which remains in spite of the\\r\\npoints of agreement compels us to suppose that one and the same\\r\\nprinciple has found its expression in a double form.  We have no right\\r\\nto take mind and body for two beings or substances in reciprocal\\r\\ninteraction.  We are, on the contrary, impelled to conceive the\\r\\nmaterial interaction between the elements composing the brain and\\r\\nnervous system _as an outer form of the inner ideal unity of\\r\\nconsciousness_.  What we in our inner experience become conscious of as\\r\\nthought, feeling, and resolution, is thus represented in the material\\r\\nworld by certain material processes of the brain, which as such are\\r\\nsubject to the law of the persistence of energy, although this law\\r\\ncannot be applied to the relation between cerebral and conscious\\r\\nprocesses.  It is as though the same thing were said in two languages.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSome monists are in the habit of speaking of the one Being to which\\r\\nthey refer phenomena of all sorts as the \"Absolute.\"  The word is a\\r\\nvague one, and means very different things in different philosophies.\\r\\nIt has been somewhat broadly defined as \"the ultimate principle of\\r\\nexplanation of the universe.\"  He who turns to one principle of\\r\\nexplanation will conceive the Absolute in one way, and he who turns to\\r\\nanother will, naturally, understand something else by the word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the idealist may conceive of the Absolute as an all-inclusive\\r\\nMind, of which finite minds are parts.  To Spencer, it is the\\r\\nUnknowable, a something behind the veil of phenomena.  Sometimes it\\r\\nmeans to a writer much the same thing that the word God means to other\\r\\nmen; sometimes it has a significance at the farthest remove from this\\r\\n(section 53).  Indeed, the word is so vague and ambiguous, and has\\r\\nproved itself the mother of so many confusions, that it would seem a\\r\\ndesirable thing to drop it out of philosophy altogether, and to\\r\\nsubstitute for it some less ambiguous expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems clear from the preceding pages, that, before one either\\r\\naccepts or rejects monism, one should very carefully determine just\\r\\nwhat one means by the word, and should scrutinize the considerations\\r\\nwhich may be urged in favor of the particular doctrine in question.\\r\\nThere are all sorts of monism, and men embrace them for all sorts of\\r\\nreasons.  Let me beg the reader to bear in mind;--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) The monist may be a materialist; he may be an idealist; he may be\\r\\nneither.  In the last case, he may, with Spinoza, call the one\\r\\nSubstance God; that is, he may be a Pantheist.  On the other hand, he\\r\\nmay, with Spencer, call it the Unknowable, and be an Agnostic.  Other\\r\\nshades of opinion are open to him, if he cares to choose them.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) It does not seem wise to assent hastily to such statements as; \"The\\r\\nuniverse is the manifestation of one unitary Being\"; or: \"Mind and\\r\\nmatter are the expression of one and the same principle.\"  We find\\r\\nrevealed in our experience mental phenomena and physical phenomena.  In\\r\\nwhat sense they are one, or whether they are one in any sense,--this is\\r\\nsomething to be determined by an examination of the phenomena and of\\r\\nthe relations in which we find them.  It may turn out that the universe\\r\\nis one only in the sense that all phenomena belong to the one orderly\\r\\nsystem.  If we find that this is the case, we may still, if we choose,\\r\\ncall our doctrine monism, but we should carefully distinguish such a\\r\\nmonism from those represented by H\\xc3\\xb6ffding and Spencer and many others.\\r\\nThere seems little reason to use the word, when the doctrine has been\\r\\nso far modified.\\r\\n\\r\\n58. DUALISM.--The plain man finds himself in a world of physical things\\r\\nand of minds, and it seems to him that his experience directly\\r\\ntestifies to the existence of both.  This means that the things of\\r\\nwhich he has experience appear to belong to two distinct classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not mean, of course, that he has only two kinds of experiences.\\r\\nThe phenomena which are revealed to us are indefinitely varied; all\\r\\nphysical phenomena are not just alike, and all mental phenomena are not\\r\\njust alike.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, amid all the bewildering variety that forces itself upon\\r\\nour attention, there stands out one broad distinction, that of the\\r\\nphysical and the mental.  It is a distinction that the man who has done\\r\\nno reading in the philosophers is scarcely tempted to obliterate; to\\r\\nhim the world consists of two kinds of things widely different from\\r\\neach other; minds are not material things and material things are not\\r\\nminds.  We are justified in regarding this as the opinion of the plain\\r\\nman even when we recognize that, in his endeavor to make clear to\\r\\nhimself what he means by minds, he sometimes speaks as though he were\\r\\ntalking about something material or semi-material.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the materialist allows these two classes to run together; so does\\r\\nthe idealist.  The one says that everything is matter; the other, that\\r\\neverything is mind.  It would be foolish to maintain that nothing can\\r\\nbe said for either doctrine, for men of ability have embraced each.\\r\\nBut one may at least say that both seem to be refuted by our common\\r\\nexperience of the world, an experience which, so far as it is permitted\\r\\nto testify at all, lifts up its voice in favor of _Dualism_.\\r\\n\\r\\nDualism is sometimes defined as the doctrine that there are in the\\r\\nworld two kinds of substances, matter and mind, which are different in\\r\\nkind and should be kept distinct.  There are dualists who prefer to\\r\\navoid the use of the word substance, and to say that the world of our\\r\\nexperiences consists of physical phenomena and of mental phenomena, and\\r\\nthat these two classes of facts should be kept separate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dualist may maintain that we have a direct knowledge of matter and\\r\\nof mind, and he may content himself with such a statement, doing little\\r\\nto make clear what we mean by matter and by mind.  In this case, his\\r\\nposition is little different from that of the plain man who does not\\r\\nattempt to philosophize.  Thomas Reid (section 50) belongs to this\\r\\nclass.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the dualist may attempt to make clear, through\\r\\nphilosophical reflection, what we mean by the matter and mind which\\r\\nexperience seems to give us.  He may conclude:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) That he must hold, as did Sir William Hamilton, that we perceive\\r\\ndirectly only physical and mental phenomena, but are justified in\\r\\ninferring that, since the phenomena are different, there must be two\\r\\nkinds of underlying substances to which the phenomena are referred.\\r\\nThus, he may distinguish between the two substances and their\\r\\nmanifestations, as some monists distinguish between the one substance\\r\\nand its manifestations.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) Or he may conclude that it is futile to search for substances or\\r\\nrealities of any sort _behind_ phenomena, arguing that such realities\\r\\nare never revealed in experience, and that no sound reason for their\\r\\nassumption can be adduced.  In this case, he may try to make plain what\\r\\nmind and matter are, by simply analyzing our experiences of mind and\\r\\nmatter and coming to a clearer comprehension of their nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the reader has probably remarked, the philosophy presented in the\\r\\nearlier chapters of this book (Chapters III to XI) is _dualistic_ as\\r\\nwell as _realistic_.  That is to say, it refuses to rub out the\\r\\ndistinction between physical phenomena and mental phenomena, either by\\r\\ndissolving the material world into ideas; by calling ideas secretions\\r\\nor functions of the brain; or by declaring them one in a fictitious\\r\\nentity behind the veil and not supposed to be exactly identical with\\r\\neither.  And as it teaches that the only reality that it means anything\\r\\nto talk about must be found in experience, it is a dualism of the type\\r\\ndescribed in the paragraph which immediately precedes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a philosophy does not seem to do violence to the common experience\\r\\nof minds and of physical things shared by us all, whether we are\\r\\nphilosophers or are not.  It only tries to make clear what we all know\\r\\ndimly and vaguely.  This is, I think, a point in its favor.  However,\\r\\nmen of great ability and of much learning have inclined to doctrines\\r\\nvery different; and we have no right to make up our minds on such a\\r\\nsubject as this without trying to give them an attentive and an\\r\\nimpartial hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n59. SINGULARISM AND PLURALISM.--There are those who apply to the\\r\\nvarious forms of monism the title _Singularism_, and who contrast with\\r\\nthis _Pluralism_, a word which is meant to cover the various doctrines\\r\\nwhich maintain that there is more than one ultimate principle or being\\r\\nin the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is argued that we should have some word under which we may bring\\r\\nsuch a doctrine, for example, as that of the Greek philosopher\\r\\nEmpedocles (born about 490 B.C.).  This thinker made earth, water,\\r\\nfire, and air the four material principles or \"roots\" of things.  He\\r\\nwas not a monist, and we can certainly not call him a dualist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  The term pluralism has been used to indicate the doctrine that\\r\\nindividual finite minds are not parts or manifestations of one\\r\\nall-embracing Mind,--of God or the Absolute,--but are relatively\\r\\nindependent beings.  This doctrine has been urged in our own time, with\\r\\neloquence and feeling, by Professor Howison.[2]  Here we have a\\r\\npluralism which is idealistic, for it admits in the universe but one\\r\\n_kind_ of thing, minds; and yet refuses to call itself monistic.  It\\r\\nwill readily be seen that in this paragraph and in the one preceding\\r\\nthe word is used in different senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have added the above sentences to this chapter that the reader may\\r\\nhave an explanation of the meaning of a word sometimes met with.  But\\r\\nthe title of the chapter is \"Monism and Dualism,\" and it is of this\\r\\ncontrast that it is especially important to grasp the significance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Outlines of Psychology,\" pp. 64-65, English translation, 1891.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] \"The Limits of Evolution, and Other Essays,\" revised edition.  New\\r\\nYork, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV\\r\\n\\r\\nRATIONALISM, EMPIRICISM, CRITICISM, AND CRITICAL EMPIRICISM\\r\\n\\r\\n60. RATIONALISM.--As the content of a philosophical doctrine must be\\r\\ndetermined by the _initial assumptions_ which a philosopher makes and\\r\\nby the _method_ which he adopts in his reasonings, it is well to\\r\\nexamine with some care certain broad differences in this respect which\\r\\ncharacterize different philosophers, and which help to explain how it\\r\\nis that the results of their reflections are so startlingly different.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall first speak of _Rationalism_, which I may somewhat loosely\\r\\ndefine as the doctrine that the reason can attain truths independently\\r\\nof observation--can go beyond experienced fact and the deductions which\\r\\nexperience seems to justify us in making from experienced fact.  The\\r\\ndefinition cannot mean much to us until it is interpreted by a concrete\\r\\nexample, and I shall turn to such.  It must, however, be borne in mind\\r\\nthat the word \"rationalism\" is meant to cover a great variety of\\r\\nopinions, and we have said comparatively little about him when we have\\r\\ncalled a man a rationalist in philosophy.  Men may agree in believing\\r\\nthat the reason can go beyond experienced fact, and yet may differ\\r\\nregarding the particular truths which may be thus attained.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when Descartes found himself discontented with the philosophy that\\r\\nhe and others had inherited from the Middle Ages, and undertook a\\r\\nreconstruction, he found it necessary to throw over a vast amount of\\r\\nwhat had passed as truth, if only with a view to building up again upon\\r\\na firmer foundation.  It appeared to him that much was uncritically\\r\\naccepted as true in philosophy and in the sciences which a little\\r\\nreflection revealed to be either false or highly doubtful.\\r\\nAccordingly, he decided to clear the ground by a sweeping doubt, and to\\r\\nbegin his task quite independently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with this principle, he rejected the testimony of the\\r\\nsenses touching the existence of a world of external things.  Do not\\r\\nthe senses sometimes deceive us?  And, since men seem to be liable to\\r\\nerror in their reasonings, even in a field so secure as that of\\r\\nmathematical demonstration, he resolved further to repudiate all the\\r\\nreasonings he had heretofore accepted.  He would not even assume\\r\\nhimself to be in his right mind and awake; might he not be the victim\\r\\nof a diseased fancy, or a man deluded by dreams?\\r\\n\\r\\nCould anything whatever escape this all-devouring doubt?  One truth\\r\\nseemed unshakable: his own existence, at least, emerged from this sea\\r\\nof uncertainties.  I may be deceived in thinking that there is an\\r\\nexternal world, and that I am awake and really perceive things; but I\\r\\nsurely cannot be deceived unless I exist.  _Cogito, ergo sum_--I think,\\r\\nhence I exist; this truth Descartes accepted as the first principle of\\r\\nthe new and sounder philosophy which he sought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we read farther in Descartes we discover that he takes back again a\\r\\ngreat many of those things that he had at the outset rejected as\\r\\nuncertain.  Thus, he accepts an external world of material things.  How\\r\\ndoes he establish its existence?  He cannot do it as the empiricist\\r\\ndoes it, by a reference to experienced fact, for he does not believe\\r\\nthat the external world is directly given in our experience.  He thinks\\r\\nwe are directly conscious only of our _ideas_ of it, and must somehow\\r\\nprove that it exists over against our ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy his principles, Descartes is compelled to fall back upon a curious\\r\\nroundabout argument to prove that there is a world.  He must first\\r\\nprove that God exists, and then argue that God would not deceive us\\r\\ninto thinking that it exists when it does not.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when we come to examine Descartes\\' reasonings in detail we find\\r\\nwhat appear to us some very uncritical assumptions.  Thus, he proves\\r\\nthe existence of God by the following argument:--\\r\\n\\r\\nI exist, and I find in me the idea of God; of this idea I cannot be the\\r\\nauthor, for it represents something much greater than I, and its cause\\r\\nmust be as great as the reality it represents.  In other words, nothing\\r\\nless than God can be the cause of the idea of God which I find in me,\\r\\nand, hence, I may infer that God exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere did Descartes get this notion that every idea must have a cause\\r\\nwhich contains as much external reality as the idea does represented\\r\\nreality?  How does he prove his assumption?  He simply appeals to what\\r\\nhe calls \"the natural light,\" which is for him a source of all sorts of\\r\\ninformation which cannot be derived from experience.  This \"natural\\r\\nlight\" furnishes him with a vast number of \"eternal truths\", these he\\r\\nhas not brought under the sickle of his sweeping doubt, and these help\\r\\nhim to build up again the world he has overthrown, beginning with the\\r\\none indubitable fact discussed above.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the men of a later time many of Descartes\\' eternal truths are simply\\r\\ninherited philosophical prejudices, the results of the reflections of\\r\\nearlier thinkers, and in sad need of revision.  I shall not criticise\\r\\nthem in detail.  The important point for us to notice is that we have\\r\\nhere a type of philosophy which depends upon truths revealed by the\\r\\nreason, independently of experience, to carry one beyond the sphere of\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI again remind the reader that there are all sorts of rationalists, in\\r\\nthe philosophical sense of the word.  Some trust the power of the\\r\\nunaided reason without reserve.  Thus Spinoza, the pantheist, made the\\r\\nmagnificent but misguided attempt to deduce the whole system of things\\r\\nphysical and things mental from what he called the attributes of God,\\r\\nExtension and Thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, one may be a good deal of an empiricist, and yet\\r\\nsomething of a rationalist, too.  Thus Professor Strong, in his recent\\r\\nbrilliant book, \"Why the Mind has a Body,\" maintains that we know\\r\\nintuitively that other minds than our own exist; know it without\\r\\ngathering our information from experience, and without having to\\r\\nestablish the fact in any way.  This seems, at least, akin to the\\r\\ndoctrine of the \"natural light,\" and yet no one can say that Professor\\r\\nStrong does not, in general, believe in a philosophy of observation and\\r\\nexperiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n61. EMPIRICISM.--I suppose every one who has done some reading in the\\r\\nhistory of philosophy will, if his mother tongue be English, think of\\r\\nthe name of John Locke when empiricism is mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke, in his \"Essay concerning Human Understanding,\" undertakes \"to\\r\\ninquire into the original, certainty, and extent of human knowledge,\\r\\ntogether with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and assent.\"\\r\\nHis sober and cautious work, which was first published in 1690, was\\r\\npeculiarly English in character; and the spirit which it exemplifies\\r\\nanimates also Locke\\'s famous successors, George Berkeley (1684-1753),\\r\\nDavid Hume (1711-1776), and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873).  Although\\r\\nLocke was a realist, Berkeley an idealist, Hume a skeptic, and Mill\\r\\nwhat has been called a sensationalist; yet all were empiricists of a\\r\\nsort, and emphasized the necessity of founding our knowledge upon\\r\\nexperience.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Locke was familiar with the writings of Descartes, whose work he\\r\\nadmired, but whose rationalism offended him.  The first book of the\\r\\n\"Essay\" is devoted to the proof that there are in the mind of man no\\r\\n\"innate ideas\" and no \"innate principles.\"  That is to say, Locke tries\\r\\nto show that one must not seek, in the \"natural light\" to which\\r\\nDescartes turned, a distinct and independent source of information,\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Let us, then,\" he continues, \"suppose the mind to be, as we say, white\\r\\npaper, void of all characters, without any ideas; how comes it to be\\r\\nfurnished?  Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and\\r\\nboundless fancy of man has painted on it, with an almost endless\\r\\nvariety?  Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge?  To\\r\\nthis I answer in one word, from experience; in that all our knowledge\\r\\nis founded, and from that it ultimately derives itself.  Our\\r\\nobservation, employed either about external sensible objects, or about\\r\\nthe internal operations of our minds, perceived and reflected on by\\r\\nourselves, is that which supplies our understandings with all the\\r\\nmaterials of thinking.  These two are the fountains of knowledge, from\\r\\nwhence all the ideas we have, or can naturally have, do spring.\" [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, all we know and all we ever shall know of the world of matter and\\r\\nof minds must rest ultimately upon observation,--observation of\\r\\nexternal things and of our own mind.  We must clip the erratic wing of\\r\\na \"reason\" which seeks to soar beyond such knowledge; which leaves the\\r\\nsolid earth, and hangs suspended in the void.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But hold,\" exclaims the critical reader; \"have we not seen that Locke,\\r\\nas well as Descartes (section 48), claims to know what he cannot prove\\r\\nby direct observation or even by a legitimate inference from what has\\r\\nbeen directly observed?  Does he not maintain that the mind has an\\r\\nimmediate knowledge or experience only of its own ideas?  How can he\\r\\nprove that there are material extended things outside causing these\\r\\nideas?  And if he cannot prove it by an appeal to experience, to direct\\r\\nobservation, is he not, in accepting the existence of the external\\r\\nworld at all, just as truly as Descartes, a rationalist?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe objection is well taken.  On his own principles, Locke had no right\\r\\nto believe in an external world.  He has stolen his world, so to speak;\\r\\nhe has taken it by violence.  Nevertheless, as I pointed out in the\\r\\nsection above referred to, Locke is not a rationalist of _malice\\r\\nprepense_.  He _tries_ to be an empiricist.  He believes in the\\r\\nexternal world because he thinks it is directly revealed to the\\r\\nsenses--he inconsistently refers to experience as evidence of its\\r\\nexistence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has often been claimed by those who do not sympathize with\\r\\nempiricism that the empiricists make assumptions much as others do, but\\r\\nhave not the grace to admit it.  I think we must frankly confess that a\\r\\nman may try hard to be an empiricist and may not be wholly successful.\\r\\nMoreover, reflection forces us to the conclusion that when we have\\r\\ndefined empiricism as a doctrine which rests throughout upon an appeal\\r\\nto \"experience\" we have not said anything very definite.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is _experience_?  What may we accept as directly revealed fact?\\r\\nThe answer to such questions is far from an easy one to give.  It is a\\r\\nharder matter to discuss intelligently than any one can at all realize\\r\\nuntil he has spent some years in following the efforts of the\\r\\nphilosophers to determine what is \"revealed fact.\"  We are supposed to\\r\\nhave experience of our own minds, of space, of time, of matter.  What\\r\\nare these things as revealed in our experience?  We have seen in the\\r\\nearlier chapters of this book that one cannot answer such questions\\r\\noff-hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n62.  CRITICISM.--I have in another chapter (section 51) given a brief\\r\\naccount of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.  He called his doctrine\\r\\n\"Criticism,\" and he distinguished it from \"Dogmatism\" and \"Empiricism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery philosophy that transcends experience, without first critically\\r\\nexamining our faculty of knowledge and determining its right to spread\\r\\nits wings in this way, Kant calls \"dogmatism.\"  The word seems rather\\r\\nan offensive one, in its usual signification, at least; and it is as\\r\\nwell not to use it.  As Kant used the word, Descartes was a dogmatist;\\r\\nbut let us rather call him a rationalist.  He certainly had no\\r\\nintention of proceeding uncritically, as we shall see a little later.\\r\\nIf we call him a dogmatist we seem to condemn him in advance, by\\r\\napplying to him an abusive epithet.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpiricism, according to Kant, confines human knowledge to experience,\\r\\nand thus avoids the errors which beset the dogmatist.  But then, as\\r\\nHume seemed to have shown, empiricism must run out into skepticism.  If\\r\\nall our knowledge has its foundations in experience, how can we expect\\r\\nto find in our possession any universal or necessary truths?  May not a\\r\\nlater experience contradict an earlier?  How can we be sure that what\\r\\nhas been will be?  Can we _know_ that there is anything fixed and\\r\\ncertain in our world?\\r\\n\\r\\nSkepticism seemed a forlorn doctrine, and, casting about for a way of\\r\\nescape from it, Kant hit upon the expedient which I have described.  So\\r\\nlong as we maintain that our knowledge has no other source than the\\r\\nexperiences which the world imprints upon us, so to speak, from\\r\\nwithout, we are without the power of prediction, for new experiences\\r\\nmay annihilate any generalizations we have founded upon those already\\r\\nvouchsafed us; but if we assume that the world upon which we gaze, the\\r\\nworld of phenomena, is made what it is by the mind that perceives it,\\r\\nare we not in a different position?\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose, for example, we take the statement that there must be an\\r\\nadequate cause of all the changes that take place in the world.  Can a\\r\\nmere experience of what has been in the past guarantee that this law\\r\\nwill hold good in the future?  But, when we realize that the world of\\r\\nwhich we are speaking is nothing more than a world of phenomena, of\\r\\nexperiences, and realize further that this whole world is constructed\\r\\nby the mind out of the raw materials furnished by the senses, may we\\r\\nnot have a greater confidence in our law?  If it is the nature of the\\r\\nmind to connect the phenomena presented to it with one another as cause\\r\\nand effect, may we not maintain that no phenomenon can possibly make\\r\\nits appearance that defies the law in question?  How could it appear\\r\\nexcept under the conditions laid upon all phenomena?  If it is our\\r\\nnature to think the world as an orderly one, and if we can know no\\r\\nworld save the one we construct ourselves, the orderliness of all the\\r\\nthings we can know seems to be guaranteed to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be noticed that Kant\\'s doctrine has a negative side.  He limits\\r\\nour knowledge to phenomena, to experiences, and he is himself, in so\\r\\nfar, an empiricist.  But in that he finds in experience an order, an\\r\\narrangement of things, not derived from experience in the usual sense\\r\\nof the word, he is not an empiricist.  He has paid his own doctrine the\\r\\ncompliment of calling it \"criticism,\" as I have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I beg the reader to be here, as elsewhere, on his guard against\\r\\nthe associations which attach to words.  In calling Kant\\'s doctrine\\r\\n\"the critical philosophy,\" we are in some danger of uncritically\\r\\nassuming and leading others to believe uncritically that it is free\\r\\nfrom such defects as may be expected to attach to \"dogmatism\" and to\\r\\nempiricism.  Such a position should not be taken until one has made a\\r\\nmost careful examination of each of the three types of doctrine, of the\\r\\nassumptions which it makes, and of the rigor with which it draws\\r\\ninferences upon the basis of such assumptions.  That we may be the\\r\\nbetter able to withstand \"undue influence,\" I call attention to the\\r\\nfollowing points:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) We must bear in mind that the attempt to make a critical\\r\\nexamination into the foundations of our knowledge, and to determine its\\r\\nscope, is by no means a new thing.  Among the Greeks, Plato, Aristotle,\\r\\nthe Stoics, the Epicureans, and the Skeptics, all attacked the problem.\\r\\nIt did not, of course, present itself to these men in the precise form\\r\\nin which it presented itself to Kant, but each and all were concerned\\r\\nto find an answer to the question: Can we know anything with certainty;\\r\\nand, if so, what?  They may have failed to be thoroughly critical, but\\r\\nthey certainly made the attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall omit mention of the long series of others, who, since that\\r\\ntime, have carried on the tradition, and shall speak only of Descartes\\r\\nand Locke, whom I have above brought forward as representatives of the\\r\\ntwo types of doctrine that Kant contrasts with his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo see how strenuously Descartes endeavored to subject his knowledge to\\r\\na critical scrutiny and to avoid unjustifiable assumptions of any sort,\\r\\none has only to read that charming little work of genius, the\\r\\n\"Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his youth Descartes was, as he informs us, an eager student; but,\\r\\nwhen he had finished the whole course of education usually prescribed,\\r\\nhe found himself so full of doubts and errors that he did not feel that\\r\\nhe had advanced in learning at all.  Yet he had been well tutored, and\\r\\nwas considered as bright in mind as others.  He was led to judge his\\r\\nneighbor by himself, and to conclude that there existed no such certain\\r\\nscience as he had been taught to suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving ripened with years and experience, Descartes set about the task\\r\\nof which I have spoken above, the task of sweeping away the whole body\\r\\nof his opinions and of attempting a general and systematic\\r\\nreconstruction.  So important a work should be, he thought, approached\\r\\nwith circumspection; hence, he formulated certain Rules of Method.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The first,\" he writes, \"was never to accept anything for true which I\\r\\ndid not clearly know to be such; that is, carefully to avoid haste and\\r\\nprejudice, and to include nothing more in my judgments than what was\\r\\npresented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all reason\\r\\nfor doubt.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was our philosopher\\'s design, and such the spirit in which he set\\r\\nabout it.  We have seen the result above.  It is as if Descartes had\\r\\ndecided that a certain room full of people did not appear to be free\\r\\nfrom suspicious characters, and had cleared out every one, afterwards\\r\\nposting himself at the door to readmit only those who proved themselves\\r\\nworthy.  When we examine those who succeeded in passing muster, we\\r\\ndiscover he has favored all his old friends.  He simply _cannot_ doubt\\r\\nthem; are they not vouched for by the \"natural light\"?  Nevertheless,\\r\\nwe must not forget that Descartes sifted his congregation with much\\r\\ntravail of spirit.  He did try to be critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for John Locke, he reveals in the \"Epistle to the Reader,\" which\\r\\nstands as a preface to the \"Essay,\" the critical spirit in which his\\r\\nwork was taken up.  \"Were it fit to trouble thee,\" he writes, \"with the\\r\\nhistory of this Essay, I should tell thee, that five or six friends\\r\\nmeeting at my chamber, and discoursing on a subject very remote from\\r\\nthis, found themselves quickly at a stand, by the difficulties that\\r\\nrose on every side.  After we had a while puzzled ourselves, without\\r\\ncoming any nearer a resolution of those doubts which perplexed us, it\\r\\ncame into my thoughts, that we took a wrong course; and that before we\\r\\nset ourselves upon inquiries of that nature, it was necessary to\\r\\nexamine our own abilities, and to see what objects our understandings\\r\\nwere, or were not, fitted to deal with.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis problem, proposed by himself to his little circle of friends,\\r\\nLocke attacked with earnestness, and as a result he brought out many\\r\\nyears later the work which has since become so famous.  The book is\\r\\nliterally a critique of the reason, although a very different critique\\r\\nfrom that worked out by Kant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If, by this inquiry into the nature of the understanding,\" says Locke,\\r\\n\"I can discover the powers thereof, how far they reach, to what things\\r\\nthey are in any degree proportionate, and where they fail us; I suppose\\r\\nit may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more\\r\\ncautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension; to stop\\r\\nwhen it is at the utmost extent of its tether; and to sit down in a\\r\\nquiet ignorance of those things which upon examination are found to be\\r\\nbeyond the reach of our capacities.\" [2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the difficulties of the task our author is fully alive: \"The\\r\\nunderstanding, like the eye, whilst it makes us see and perceive all\\r\\nother things, takes no notice of itself; and it requires art and pains\\r\\nto set it at a distance, and make it its own object.  But whatever be\\r\\nthe difficulties that lie in the way of this inquiry, whatever it be\\r\\nthat keeps us so much in the dark to ourselves, sure I am that all the\\r\\nlight we can let in upon our own minds, all the acquaintance we can\\r\\nmake with our own understandings, will not only be very pleasant, but\\r\\nbring us great advantage, in directing our thoughts in the search, of\\r\\nother things.\" [3]\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) Thus, many men have attempted to produce a critical philosophy, and\\r\\nin much the same sense as that in which Kant uses the words.  Those who\\r\\nhave come after them have decided that they were not sufficiently\\r\\ncritical, that they have made unjustifiable assumptions.  When we come\\r\\nto read Kant, we will, if we have read the history of philosophy with\\r\\nprofit, not forget to ask ourselves if he has not sinned in the same\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, we will ask;--\\r\\n\\r\\n(a) Was Kant right in maintaining that we find in experience synthetic\\r\\njudgments (section 51) that are not founded upon experience, but yield\\r\\nsuch information as is beyond the reach of the empiricist?  There are\\r\\nthose who think that the judgments to which he alludes in evidence of\\r\\nhis contention--the mathematical, for instance--are not of this\\r\\ncharacter.\\r\\n\\r\\n(b) Was he justified in assuming that all the ordering of our world is\\r\\ndue to the activity of mind, and that merely the raw material is\\r\\n\"given\" us through the senses?  There are many who demur against such a\\r\\nstatement, and hold that it is, if not in all senses untrue, at least\\r\\nhighly misleading, since it seems to argue that there is no really\\r\\nexternal world at all.  Moreover, they claim that the doctrine is\\r\\nneither self-evident nor susceptible of proper proof.\\r\\n\\r\\n(c) Was Kant justified in assuming that, even if we attribute the\\r\\n\"form\" or arrangement of the world we know to the native activity of\\r\\nthe mind, the necessity and universality of our knowledge is assured?\\r\\nLet us grant that the proposition, whatever happens must have an\\r\\nadequate cause, is a \"form of thought.\"  What guarantee have we that\\r\\nthe \"forms of thought\" must ever remain changeless?  If it is an\\r\\nassumption for the empiricist to declare that what has been true in the\\r\\npast will be true in the future, that earlier experiences of the world\\r\\nwill not be contradicted by later; what is it for the Kantian to\\r\\nmaintain that the order which he finds in his experience will\\r\\nnecessarily and always be the order of all future experiences?\\r\\nTransferring an assumption to the field of mind does not make it less\\r\\nof an assumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, it does not seem unreasonable to charge Kant with being a good\\r\\ndeal of a rationalist.  He tried to confine our knowledge to the field\\r\\nof experience, it is true; but he made a number of assumptions as to\\r\\nthe nature of experience which certainly do not shine by their own\\r\\nlight, and which many thoughtful persons regard as incapable of\\r\\njustification.\\r\\n\\r\\nKant\\'s famous successors in the German philosophy, Fichte (1762-1814),\\r\\nSchelling (1775-1854), Hegel (1770-1831), and Schopenhauer (1788-1860),\\r\\nall received their impulse from the \"critical philosophy,\" and yet each\\r\\ndeveloped his doctrine in a relatively independent way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot here take the space to characterize the systems of these men;\\r\\nI may merely remark that all of them contrast strongly in doctrine and\\r\\nmethod with the British philosophers mentioned in the last section,\\r\\nLocke, Berkeley, Hume, and Mill.  They are _un-empirical_, if one may\\r\\nuse such a word; and, to one accustomed to reading the English\\r\\nphilosophy, they seem ever ready to spread their wings and hazard the\\r\\nboldest of flights without a proper realization of the thinness of the\\r\\natmosphere in which they must support themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, no matter what may be one\\'s opinion of the actual results\\r\\nattained by these German philosophers, one must frankly admit that no\\r\\none who wishes to understand clearly the development of speculative\\r\\nthought can afford to dispense with a careful reading of them.  Much\\r\\neven of the English philosophy of our own day must remain obscure to\\r\\nthose who have not looked into their pages.  Thus, the thought of Kant\\r\\nand Hegel molded the thought of Thomas Hill Green (1836-1882) and of\\r\\nthe brothers Caird; and their influence has made itself widely felt\\r\\nboth in England and in America.  One cannot criticise intelligently\\r\\nbooks written from their standpoint, unless one knows how the authors\\r\\ncame by their doctrine and out of what it has been developed.\\r\\n\\r\\n63. CRITICAL EMPIRICISM.--We have seen that the trouble with the\\r\\nrationalists seemed to be that they made an appeal to \"eternal truths,\"\\r\\nwhich those who followed them could not admit to be eternal truths at\\r\\nall.  They proceeded on a basis of assumptions the validity of which\\r\\nwas at once called in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke, the empiricist, repudiated all this, and then also made\\r\\nassumptions which others could not, and cannot, approve.  Kant did\\r\\nsomething of much the same sort; we cannot regard his \"criticism\" as\\r\\nwholly critical.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can we avoid such errors?  How walk cautiously, and go around the\\r\\npit into which, as it seems to us, others have fallen?  I may as well\\r\\ntell the reader frankly that he sets his hope too high if he expects to\\r\\navoid all error and to work out for himself a philosophy in all\\r\\nrespects unassailable.  The difficulties of reflective thought are very\\r\\ngreat, and we should carry with us a consciousness of that fact and a\\r\\nwillingness to revise our most cherished conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur initial difficulty seems to be that we must begin by assuming\\r\\n_something_, if only as material upon which to work.  We must begin our\\r\\nphilosophizing _somewhere_.  Where shall we begin?  May we not fall\\r\\ninto error at the very outset?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctrine set forth in the earlier chapters of this volume maintains\\r\\nthat we must accept as our material the revelation of the mind and the\\r\\nworld which seems to be made in our common experience, and which is\\r\\nextended and systematized in the sciences.  But it insists that we must\\r\\nregard such an acceptance as merely provisional, must subject our\\r\\nconcepts to a careful criticism, and must always be on our guard\\r\\nagainst hasty assumptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt emphasizes the value of the light which historical study casts upon\\r\\nthe real meaning of the concepts which we all use and must use, but\\r\\nwhich have so often proved to be stones of stumbling in the path of\\r\\nthose who have employed them.  Its watchword is analysis, always\\r\\nanalysis; and a settled distrust of what have so often passed as\\r\\n\"self-evident\" truths.  It regards it as its task to analyze\\r\\nexperience, while maintaining that only the satisfactory carrying out\\r\\nof such an analysis can reveal what experience really is, and clear our\\r\\nnotions of it from misinterpretations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo such attempt to give an account of experience can be regarded as\\r\\nfundamentally new in its method.  Every philosopher, in his own way,\\r\\ncriticises experience, and seeks its interpretation.  But one may,\\r\\nwarned by the example of one\\'s predecessors, lay emphasis upon the\\r\\ndanger of half-analyses and hasty assumptions, and counsel the\\r\\nobservance of sobriety and caution.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor convenience, I have called the doctrine _Critical Empiricism_.  I\\r\\nwarn the reader against the seductive title, and advise him not to\\r\\nallow it to influence him unduly in his judgment of the doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\n64. PRAGMATISM.--It seems right that I should, before closing this\\r\\nchapter, say a few words about Pragmatism, which has been so much\\r\\ndiscussed in the last few years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1878 Mr. Charles S. Peirce wrote an article for the _Popular Science\\r\\nMonthly_ in which he proposed as a maxim for the attainment of\\r\\nclearness of apprehension the following: \"Consider what effects, which\\r\\nmight conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of\\r\\nour conception to have.  Then, our conception of these effects is the\\r\\nwhole of our conception of the object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis thought has been taken up by others and given a development which\\r\\nMr. Peirce regards with some suspicion.  He refers[4] especially to the\\r\\ndevelopment it has received at the hands of Professor William James, in\\r\\nhis two essays, \"The Will to Believe\" and \"Philosophical Conceptions\\r\\nand Practical Results.\" [5]  Professor James is often regarded as\\r\\nforemost among the pragmatists.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall not attempt to define pragmatism, for I do not believe that the\\r\\ndoctrine has yet attained to that definiteness of formulation which\\r\\nwarrants a definition.  We seem to have to do not so much with a\\r\\nclear-cut doctrine, the limits and consequences of which have been\\r\\nworked out in detail, as with a tendency which makes itself apparent in\\r\\nthe works of various writers under somewhat different forms.\\r\\n\\r\\nI may roughly describe it as the tendency to take that to be _true_\\r\\nwhich is _useful_ or _serviceable_.  It is well illustrated in the two\\r\\nessays to which reference is made above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, Professor James dwells upon the unsatisfactoriness and\\r\\nuncertainty of philosophical and scientific knowledge: \"Objective\\r\\nevidence and certitude are doubtless very fine ideals to play with, but\\r\\nwhere on this moonlit and dream-visited planet are they found?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, among those things regarding which it appears impossible to attain\\r\\nto intellectual certitude, there are matters of great practical moment,\\r\\nand which affect deeply the conduct of life; for example, the doctrines\\r\\nof religion.  Here a merely skeptical attitude seems intolerable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such cases, argues Professor James, \"we have the right to believe at\\r\\nour own risk any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to notice that there is no question here of a logical\\r\\nright.  We are concerned with matters regarding which, according to\\r\\nProfessor James, we cannot look for intellectual evidence.  It is\\r\\nassumed that we believe simply because we choose to believe--we believe\\r\\narbitrarily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is further important to notice that what is a \"live\" hypothesis to\\r\\none man need not tempt the will of another man at all.  As our author\\r\\npoints out, a Turk would naturally will to believe one thing and a\\r\\nChristian would will to believe another.  Each would will to believe\\r\\nwhat struck him as a satisfactory thing to believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat shall we say to this doctrine?  I think we must say that it is\\r\\nclearly not a philosophical _method of attaining to truth_.  Hence, it\\r\\nhas not properly a place in this chapter among the attempts which have\\r\\nbeen made to attain to the truth of things.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, in fact, not concerned with truths, but with assumptions, and\\r\\nwith assumptions which are supposed to be made on the basis of no\\r\\nevidence.  It is concerned with \"seemings.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distinction is a very important one.  Our Turk cannot, by willing\\r\\nto believe it, make his hypothesis true; but he can make it _seem_\\r\\ntrue.  Why should he wish to make it seem true whether it is true or\\r\\nnot?  Why should he strive to attain to a feeling of subjective\\r\\ncertainty, not by logically resolving his doubts, but by ignoring them?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer is given us by our author.  He who lives in the midst of\\r\\ndoubts, and refuses to cut his knot with the sword of belief, misses\\r\\nthe good of life.  This is a practical problem, and one of no small\\r\\nmoment.  In the last section of this book I have tried to indicate what\\r\\nit is wise for a man to do when he is confronted by doubts which he\\r\\ncannot resolve.\\r\\n\\r\\nInto the general question whether even a false belief may not, under\\r\\nsome circumstances, be more serviceable than no belief at all, I shall\\r\\nnot enter.  The point I wish to emphasize is that there is all the\\r\\ndifference in the world between _producing a belief_ and _proving a\\r\\ntruth_.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are compelled to accept it as a fact that men, under the influence\\r\\nof feeling, can believe in the absence of evidence, or, for that\\r\\nmatter, can believe in spite of evidence.  But a truth cannot be\\r\\nestablished in the absence of evidence or in the face of adverse\\r\\nevidence.  And there is a very wide field in which it is made very\\r\\nclear to us that beliefs adopted in the absence of evidence are in\\r\\ndanger of being false beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pragmatist would join with the rest of us in condemning the Turk or\\r\\nthe Christian who would simply will to believe in the rise or the fall\\r\\nof stocks, and would refuse to consult the state of the market.  Some\\r\\nhypotheses are, in the ordinary course of events, put to the test of\\r\\nverification.  We are then made painfully aware that beliefs and truths\\r\\nare quite distinct things, and may not be in harmony.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the pragmatist does not apply his principle to this field.  He\\r\\nconfines it to what may not inaptly be called the field of the\\r\\nunverifiable.  The Turk, who wills to believe in the hypothesis that\\r\\nappeals to him as a pious Turk, is in no such danger of a rude\\r\\nawakening as is the man who wills to believe that stocks will go up or\\r\\ndown.  But mark what this means: it means that _he is not in danger of\\r\\nfinding out what the truth really is_.  It does not mean that he is in\\r\\npossession of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I say, the doctrine which we are discussing is not a method of\\r\\nattaining to truth.  What it really attempts to do is to point out to\\r\\nus how it is prudent for us to act when we cannot discover what the\\r\\ntruth is.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"An Essay concerning Human Understanding,\" Book II, Chapter I,\\r\\nsection 2.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] Book I, Chapter I, section 4.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] Book I, Chapter I, section 1.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology,\" article \"Pragmatism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[5] Published in 1897 and 1898.\\r\\n\\r\\n[6] For references to later developments of pragmatism, see the note on\\r\\npage 312.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nV. THE PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENCES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI\\r\\n\\r\\nLOGIC\\r\\n\\r\\n65. INTRODUCTORY: THE PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENCES.--I have said in the first\\r\\nchapter of this book (section 6) that there is quite a group of\\r\\nsciences that are regarded as belonging peculiarly to the province of\\r\\nthe teacher of philosophy to-day.  Having, in the chapters preceding,\\r\\ngiven some account of the nature of reflective thought, of the problems\\r\\ntouching the world and the mind which present themselves to those who\\r\\nreflect, and of some types of philosophical theory which have their\\r\\norigin in such reflection, I turn to a brief consideration of the\\r\\nphilosophical sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong these I included logic, psychology, ethics, and aesthetics,\\r\\nmetaphysics, and the history of philosophy.  I did not include\\r\\nepistemology or \"the theory of knowledge\" as a separate discipline, and\\r\\nmy reasons for this will appear in Chapter XIX.  I remarked that, to\\r\\ncomplete the list, we should have to add the philosophy of religion and\\r\\nan investigation into the principles and methods of the sciences\\r\\ngenerally.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy, it was asked, should this group of disciplines be regarded as the\\r\\nfield of the philosopher, when others are excluded?  The answer to this\\r\\nquestion which finds the explanation of the fact to lie in a mere\\r\\nhistorical accident was declared unsatisfactory, and it was maintained\\r\\nthat the philosophical sciences are those in which we find ourselves\\r\\ncarried back to the problems of reflective thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a view to showing the truth of this opinion, I shall take up one\\r\\nby one the philosophical sciences.  Of the history of philosophy I\\r\\nshall not speak in this part of the work, but shall treat of it in\\r\\nChapter XXIII.\\r\\n\\r\\n66. THE TRADITIONAL LOGIC.--Most of us begin our acquaintance with\\r\\nlogic in the study of some such elementary manual as Jevons\\' \"Lessons\\r\\nin Logic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such books we are shown how terms represent things and classes of\\r\\nthings or their attributes, and how we unite them into propositions or\\r\\nstatements.  It is indicated at length what statements may be made on a\\r\\nbasis of certain other statements and what may not; and emphasis is\\r\\nlaid upon the dangers which arise out of a misunderstanding of the\\r\\nlanguage in which we are forced to express our thoughts.  Finally,\\r\\nthere are described for us the experimental methods by which the\\r\\nworkers in the sciences have attained to the general information about\\r\\nthe world which has become our heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch books are useful.  It is surely no small profit for a student to\\r\\ngain the habit of scrutinizing the steps by which he has come into the\\r\\npossession of a certain bit of information, and to have a quick eye for\\r\\nloose and inconsistent reasonings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is worthy of remark that one may study such a book as this and\\r\\nyet remain pretty consistently on what may be called the plane of the\\r\\ncommon understanding.  One seems to make the assumptions made in all\\r\\nthe special sciences, _e.g._ the assumption that there is a world of\\r\\nreal things and that we can know them and reason about them.  We are\\r\\nnot introduced to such problems as: What _is_ truth?  and Is _any_\\r\\nknowledge valid?  Nor does it seem at once apparent that the man who is\\r\\nstudying logic in this way is busying himself with a philosophical\\r\\ndiscipline.\\r\\n\\r\\n67. THE \"MODERN LOGIC.\"--It is very puzzling for the student to turn\\r\\nfrom such a text-book as the one above mentioned to certain others\\r\\nwhich profess to be occupied with the same science, and which, yet,\\r\\nappear to treat of quite different things.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, in Dr. Bosanquet\\'s little work on \"The Essentials of Logic,\" the\\r\\nreader is at once plunged into such questions as the nature of\\r\\nknowledge, and what is meant by the real world.  We seem to be dealing\\r\\nwith metaphysics, and not with logic, as we have learned to understand\\r\\nthe term.  How is it that the logician comes to regard these things as\\r\\nwithin his province?\\r\\n\\r\\nA multitude of writers at the present day are treating logic in this\\r\\nway, and in some great prominence is given to problems which the\\r\\nphilosopher recognizes as indisputably his own.  The term \"modern\\r\\nlogic\" is often employed to denote a logic of this type; one which does\\r\\nnot, after the fashion of the natural sciences generally, proceed on\\r\\nthe basis of certain assumptions, and leave deeper questions to some\\r\\nother discipline, but tries to get to the bottom of things for itself.\\r\\nThe tendency to run into metaphysics is peculiarly marked in those\\r\\nwriters who have been influenced by the work of the philosopher Hegel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall not here ask why those who belong to one school are more\\r\\ninclined to be metaphysical than are those who belong to another, but\\r\\nshall approach the broader question why the logicians generally are\\r\\ninclined to be more metaphysical than those who work in certain other\\r\\nspecial sciences, such as mathematics, for example.  Of the general\\r\\ntendency there can be no question.  The only problem is: Why does this\\r\\ntendency exist?\\r\\n\\r\\n68. LOGIC AND PHILOSOPHY.--Let us contrast the science of arithmetic\\r\\nwith logic; and let us notice, regarding it, the following points:--\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, like logic, a _general_ science, in that the things treated of\\r\\nin many sciences may be numbered.  It considers only a certain aspect\\r\\nof the things.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that things may be counted, added together, subtracted, etc., is\\r\\nguaranteed by the experience of the plain man; and the methods of\\r\\ndetermining the numerical relations of things are gradually developed\\r\\nbefore his eyes, beginning with operations of great simplicity.\\r\\nMoreover, verification is possible, and within certain limits\\r\\nverification by direct inspection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this we may add, that there has gradually been built up a fine\\r\\nsystem of unambiguous symbols, and it is possible for a man to know\\r\\njust what he is dealing with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, a certain beaten path has been attained, and a man may travel\\r\\nthis very well without having forced on his attention the problems of\\r\\nreflective thought.  The knowledge of numbers with which he starts is\\r\\nsufficient equipment with which to undertake the journey.  That one is\\r\\non the right road is proved by the results one obtains.  As a rule,\\r\\ndisputes can be settled by well-tried mathematical methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, then, a common agreement as to initial assumptions and\\r\\nmethods of work, and useful results are attained which seem to justify\\r\\nboth.  Here we have the normal characteristics of a special science.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not forget, however, that, even in the mathematical sciences,\\r\\nbefore a beaten path was attained, disputes as to the significance of\\r\\nnumbers and the cogency of proofs were sufficiently common.  And we\\r\\nmust bear in mind that even to-day, where the beaten path does not seem\\r\\nwholly satisfactory, men seem to be driven to reflect upon the\\r\\nsignificance of their assumptions and the nature of their method.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we find it not unnatural that a man should be led to ask; What is\\r\\na minus quantity really?  Can anything be less than nothing? or that he\\r\\nshould raise the questions: Can one rightly speak of an infinite\\r\\nnumber?  Can one infinite number be greater than another, and, if so,\\r\\nwhat can greater mean?  What are infinitesimals? and what can be meant\\r\\nby different orders of infinitesimals?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who has interested himself in such questions as these has betaken\\r\\nhimself to philosophical reflection.  They are not answered by\\r\\nemploying mathematical methods.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now turn to logic.  And let us notice, to begin with, that it is\\r\\nbroader in its application than the mathematical sciences.  It is\\r\\nconcerned to discover what constitutes _evidence_ in every field of\\r\\ninvestigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, it is true, a part of logic that may be developed somewhat\\r\\nafter the fashion of mathematics.  Thus, we may examine the two\\r\\nstatements: All men are mortal, and Caesar is a man; and we may see\\r\\nclearly that, given the truth of these, we must admit that Caesar is\\r\\nmortal.  We may make a list of possible inferences of this kind, and\\r\\npoint out under what circumstances the truth of two statements implies\\r\\nthe truth of a third, and under what circumstances the inference cannot\\r\\nbe made.  Our results can be set forth in a system of symbols.  As in\\r\\nmathematics, we may abstract from the particular things reasoned about,\\r\\nand concern ourselves only with the forms of reasoning.  This gives us\\r\\nthe theory of the _syllogism_; it is a part of logic in which the\\r\\nmathematician is apt to feel very much at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is by no means all of logic.  Let us consider the following\\r\\npoints:--\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) We are not concerned to know only what statements may be made on\\r\\nthe basis of certain other statements.  We want to know what is true\\r\\nand what is false.  We must ask: Has a man the right to set up these\\r\\nparticular statements and to reason from them?  That some men accept as\\r\\ntrue premises which are repudiated by others is an undoubted fact.\\r\\nThus, it is maintained by certain philosophers that we may assume that\\r\\nany view of the universe which is repellant to our nature cannot be\\r\\ntrue.  Shall we allow this to pass unchallenged?  And in ethics, some\\r\\nhave held that it is under all circumstances wrong to lie; others have\\r\\ndenied this, and have held that in certain cases--for example, to save\\r\\nlife or to prevent great and unmerited suffering--lying is permissible.\\r\\nShall we interest ourselves only in the deductions that each man makes\\r\\nfrom his assumed premises, and pay no attention to the truth of the\\r\\npremises themselves?\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) Again.  The vast mass of the reasonings that interest men are\\r\\nexpressed in the language that we all use and not in special symbols.\\r\\nBut language is a very imperfect instrument, and all sorts of\\r\\nmisunderstandings are possible to those who express their thoughts in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew men know exactly how much is implied in what they are saying.  If I\\r\\nsay: All men are mortal, and an angel is not a man; therefore, an angel\\r\\nis not mortal; it is not at once apparent to every one in what respect\\r\\nmy argument is defective.  He who argues: Feathers are light; light is\\r\\ncontrary to darkness; hence, feathers are contrary to darkness; is\\r\\nconvicted of error without difficulty.  But arguments of the same kind,\\r\\nand quite as bad, are to be found in learned works on matters less\\r\\nfamiliar to us, and we often fail to detect the fallacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, Herbert Spencer argues, in effect, in the fourth and fifth\\r\\nchapters of his \"First Principles,\" as follows:--\\r\\n\\r\\n  We are conscious of the Unknowable,\\r\\n  The Unknowable lies behind the veil of phenomena,\\r\\n  Hence, we are conscious of what lies behind the veil of phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only the critical reader who notices that the Unknowable in the\\r\\nfirst line is the \"raw material of consciousness,\" and the Unknowable\\r\\nin the second is something not in consciousness at all.  The two senses\\r\\nof the word \"light\" are not more different from one another.  Such\\r\\napparent arguments abound, and it often requires much acuteness to be\\r\\nable to detect their fallacious character.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we take into consideration the two points indicated above, we see\\r\\nthat the logician is at every turn forced to reflect upon our knowledge\\r\\nas men do not ordinarily reflect.  He is led to ask: What is truth?  He\\r\\ncannot accept uncritically the assumptions which men make; and he must\\r\\nendeavor to become very clearly conscious of the real meaning and the\\r\\nwhole meaning of statements expressed in words.  Even in the simple\\r\\nlogic with which we usually begin our studies, we learn to scrutinize\\r\\nstatements in a reflective way; and when we go deeper, we are at once\\r\\nin contact with philosophical problems.  It is evidently our task to\\r\\nattain to a clearer insight into the nature of our experience and the\\r\\nmeaning of proof than is attainable by the unreflective.\\r\\n\\r\\nLogic, then, is a reflective science, and it is not surprising that it\\r\\nhas held its place as one of the philosophical sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII\\r\\n\\r\\nPSYCHOLOGY\\r\\n\\r\\n69. PSYCHOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY.--I think I have said enough in Chapter\\r\\nII (section 10) about what we mean when we speak of psychology as a\\r\\nnatural science and as an independent discipline.  Certainly there are\\r\\nmany psychologists who would not care to be confused with the\\r\\nphilosophers, and there are some that regard philosophy with suspicion.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, psychology is commonly regarded as belonging to the\\r\\nphilosophical group.  That this is the case can scarcely be thought\\r\\nsurprising when we see how the psychologist himself speaks of the\\r\\nrelation of his science to philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have kept,\" writes Professor James[1] in that delightful book which\\r\\nhas become the common property of us all, \"close to the point of view\\r\\nof natural science throughout the book.  Every natural science assumes\\r\\ncertain data uncritically, and declines to challenge the elements\\r\\nbetween which its own \\'laws\\' obtain, and from which its own deductions\\r\\nare carried on.  Psychology, the science of finite individual minds,\\r\\nassumes as its data (1) _thoughts and feelings_, and (2) _a physical\\r\\nworld_ in time and space with which they coexist, and which (3) _they\\r\\nknow_.  Of course, these data themselves are discussable; but the\\r\\ndiscussion of them (as of other elements) is called metaphysics and\\r\\nfalls outside the province of this book.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an admirable statement of the scope of psychology as a natural\\r\\nscience, and also of the relations of metaphysics to the sciences.  But\\r\\nit would not be fair to Professor James to take this sentence alone,\\r\\nand to assume that, in his opinion, it is easy to separate psychology\\r\\naltogether from philosophy.  \"The reader,\" he tells us in the next\\r\\nparagraph, \"will in vain seek for any closed system in the book.  It is\\r\\nmainly a mass of descriptive details, running out into queries which\\r\\nonly a metaphysics alive to the weight of her task can hope\\r\\nsuccessfully to deal with.\"  And in the opening sentence of the preface\\r\\nhe informs us that some of his chapters are more \"metaphysical\" than is\\r\\nsuitable for students going over the subject for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the author is right in maintaining that it is not easy to draw a\\r\\nclear line between philosophy and psychology, and to declare the latter\\r\\nwholly independent, I think we must concede.  An independent science\\r\\nshould be sure of the things with which it is dealing.  Where these are\\r\\nvague and indefinite, and are the subject of constant dispute, it\\r\\ncannot march forward with assurance.  One is rather forced to go back\\r\\nand examine the data themselves.  The beaten track of the special\\r\\nscience has not been satisfactorily constructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are forced to admit that the science of psychology has not yet\\r\\nemerged from the state in which a critical examination of its\\r\\nfoundations is necessary, and that the construction of the beaten path\\r\\nis still in progress.  This I shall try to make clear by illustrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe psychologist studies the mind, and his ultimate appeal must be to\\r\\nintrospection, to a direct observation of mental phenomena, and of\\r\\ntheir relations to external things.  Now, if the observation of mental\\r\\nphenomena were a simple and an easy thing; if the mere fact that we are\\r\\nconscious of sensations and ideas implied that we are _clearly_\\r\\nconscious of them and are in a position to describe them with accuracy,\\r\\npsychology would be a much more satisfactory science than it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are not thus conscious of our mental life.  We can and do use\\r\\nour mental states without being able to describe them accurately.  In a\\r\\nsense, we are conscious of what is there, but our consciousness is\\r\\nrather dim and vague, and in our attempts to give an account of it we\\r\\nare in no little danger of giving a false account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the psychologist assumes that we perceive both physical phenomena\\r\\nand mental--the external world and the mind.  He takes it for granted\\r\\nthat we perceive mental phenomena to be related to physical.  He is\\r\\nhardly in a position to make this assumption, and then to set it aside\\r\\nas a thing he need not further consider.  Does he not tell us, as a\\r\\nresult of his investigations, that we can know the external world only\\r\\nas it is reflected in our sensations, and thus seem to shut the mind up\\r\\nwithin the circle of mental phenomena merely, cutting off absolutely a\\r\\ndirect knowledge of what is extra-mental?  If we can know only mental\\r\\nphenomena, the representatives of things, at first hand, how can we\\r\\ntell that they are representatives? and what becomes of the assumption\\r\\nthat we _perceive_ that mind is related to an external world?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said, this problem the psychologist may leave to the\\r\\nmetaphysician.  Certainly, it is one of those problems that the\\r\\nmetaphysician discusses; it has been treated in Chapter IV.  But my\\r\\ncontention is, that he who has given no thought to the matter may\\r\\neasily fall into error as to the very nature of mental phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, when we approach or recede from a physical object we have\\r\\na series of experiences which are recognized as sensational.  When we\\r\\nimagine a tree or a house we are also experiencing a mental phenomenon.\\r\\nAll these experiences _seem_ plainly to have extension in some sense of\\r\\nthe word.  We appear to perceive plainly part out of part.  In so far,\\r\\nthese mental things seem to resemble the physical things which we\\r\\ncontrast with what is mental.  Shall we say that, because these things\\r\\nare mental and not physical, their apparent extension is a delusion?\\r\\nShall we say that they really have no parts?  Such considerations have\\r\\nimpelled psychologists of eminence to maintain, in flat contradiction\\r\\nto what seems to be the unequivocal testimony of direct introspection,\\r\\nthat the total content of consciousness at any moment must be looked\\r\\nupon as an indivisible, part-less unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot, then, depend merely on direct introspection.  It is too\\r\\nuncertain in its deliverances.  If we would make clear to ourselves\\r\\nwhat mental phenomena really are, and how they | differ from physical\\r\\nphenomena, we must fall back upon the reflective analysis of our\\r\\nexperience which occupies the metaphysician (section 34).  Until we\\r\\nhave done this, we are in great danger of error.  We are actually\\r\\nuncertain of our materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  The psychologist speaks of the relation of mind and body.  Some\\r\\npsychologists incline to be parallelists, some are warm advocates of\\r\\ninteractionism.  Now, any theory of the relation of mind to body must\\r\\ndepend on observation ultimately.  If we had not direct experience of a\\r\\nrelation between the physical and the mental somewhere, no hypothesis\\r\\non the subject would ever have emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut our experiences are not perfectly clear and unequivocal to us.\\r\\nTheir significance does not seem to be easily grasped.  To comprehend\\r\\nit one is forced to that reflective examination of experience which is\\r\\ncharacteristic of the philosopher (Chapter IX).\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it may again be said: Leave the matter to the meta-physician and\\r\\ngo on with your psychological work.  I answer: The psychologist is not\\r\\nin the same position as the botanist or the zo\\xc3\\xb6logist.  He is studying\\r\\nmind in its relation to body.  It cannot but be unsatisfactory to him\\r\\nto leave that relation wholly vague; and, as a matter of fact, he\\r\\nusually takes up with one theory or another.  We have seen (section 36)\\r\\nthat he may easily adopt a theory that leads him to overlook the great\\r\\ndifference between physical phenomena and mental phenomena, and to\\r\\ntreat them as though they were the same.  This one may do in spite of\\r\\nall that introspection has to say about the gulf that separates them.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychology is, then, very properly classed among the philosophical\\r\\nsciences.  The psychologist is not sufficiently sure of his materials\\r\\nto be able to dispense with reflective thought, in many parts of his\\r\\nfield.  Some day there may come to be a consensus of opinion touching\\r\\nfundamental facts, and the science may become more independent.  A\\r\\nbeaten track may be attained; but that has not yet been done.\\r\\n\\r\\n70. THE DOUBLE AFFILIATION OF PSYCHOLOGY.--In spite of what has been\\r\\nsaid above, we must not forget that psychology is a _relatively_\\r\\nindependent science.  One may be a useful psychologist without knowing\\r\\nmuch about philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in logic it is possible to write a text-book not greatly different\\r\\nin spirit and method from text-books concerned with the sciences not\\r\\nclassed as philosophical, so it is possible to make a useful study of\\r\\nmental phenomena without entering upon metaphysical analyses.  In\\r\\nscience, as in common life, we can _use_ concepts without subjecting\\r\\nthem to careful analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, our common experience reveals that mind and body are connected.\\r\\nWe may, for a specific purpose, leave the _nature_ of this connection\\r\\nvague, and may pay careful attention to the physiological conditions of\\r\\nmental phenomena, studying in detail the senses and the nervous system.\\r\\nWe may, further, endeavor to render our knowledge of mental phenomena\\r\\nmore full and accurate by experimentation.  In doing this we may be\\r\\ncompelled to make use of elaborate apparatus.  Of such mechanical aids\\r\\nto investigation our psychological laboratories are full.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is to such work as this that we owe what is called the\\r\\n\"physiological\" and the \"experimental\" psychology.  One can carry on\\r\\nsuch investigations without being a metaphysician.  But one can\\r\\nscarcely carry them on without having a good knowledge of certain\\r\\nsciences not commonly supposed to be closely related to psychology at\\r\\nall.  Thus, one should be trained in chemistry and physics and\\r\\nphysiology, and should have a working knowledge of laboratory methods.\\r\\nMoreover, it is desirable to have a sufficient knowledge of mathematics\\r\\nto enable one to handle experimental data.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consideration of such facts as these sometimes leads men to raise\\r\\nthe question: Should psychology affiliate with philosophy or with the\\r\\nphysical sciences?  The issue is an illegitimate one.  Psychology is\\r\\none of the philosophical sciences, and cannot dispense with reflection;\\r\\nbut that is no reason why it should not acknowledge a close relation to\\r\\ncertain physical sciences as well.  Parts of the field can be isolated,\\r\\nand one may work as one works in the natural sciences generally; but if\\r\\none does nothing more, one\\'s concepts remain unanalyzed, and, as we\\r\\nhave seen in the previous section, there is some danger of actual\\r\\nmisconception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"Psychology,\" Preface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\r\\n\\r\\nETHICS AND AESTHETICS\\r\\n\\r\\n71. COMMON SENSE ETHICS.--We may, if we choose, study the actions of\\r\\nmen merely with a view to ascertaining what they are and describing\\r\\nthem accurately.  Something like this is done by the anthropologist,\\r\\nwho gives us an account of the manners and customs of the various races\\r\\nof mankind; he tells us _what is_; he may not regard it as within his\\r\\nprovince at all to inform us regarding _what ought to be_.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut men do not merely act; they judge their actions in the light of\\r\\nsome norm or standard, and they distinguish between them as right and\\r\\nwrong.  The systematic study of actions as right and wrong yields us\\r\\nthe science of ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike psychology, ethics is a special science.  It is concerned with a\\r\\nsomewhat limited field of investigation, and is not to be confounded\\r\\nwith other sciences.  It has a definite aim distinct from theirs.  And,\\r\\nalso like psychology, ethics is classed as one of the philosophical\\r\\nsciences, and its relation to philosophy is supposed to be closer than\\r\\nthat of such sciences as physics and mathematics.  It is fair to ask\\r\\nwhy this is so.  Why cannot ethics proceed on the basis of certain\\r\\nassumptions independently, and leave to some other discipline the whole\\r\\nquestion of an inquiry into the nature and validity of those\\r\\nassumptions?\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout half a century ago Dr. William Whewell, one of the most learned\\r\\nof English scholars, wrote a work entitled \"The Elements of Morality,\"\\r\\nin which he attempted to treat the science of ethics as it is generally\\r\\nadmitted that one may treat the science of geometry.  The book was\\r\\nrather widely read a generation since, but we meet with few references\\r\\nto it in our time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Morality and the philosophy of morality,\" argues the author, \"differ\\r\\nin the same manner and in the same degree as geometry and the\\r\\nphilosophy of geometry.  Of these two subjects, geometry consists of a\\r\\nseries of positive and definite propositions, deduced one from another,\\r\\nin succession, by rigorous reasoning, and all resting upon certain\\r\\ndefinitions and self-evident axioms.  The philosophy of geometry is\\r\\nquite a different subject; it includes such inquiries as these: Whence\\r\\nis the cogency of geometrical proof?  What is the evidence of the\\r\\naxioms and definitions?  What are the faculties by which we become\\r\\naware of their truth? and the like.  The two kinds of speculation have\\r\\nbeen pursued, for the most part, by two different classes of\\r\\npersons,--the geometers and the metaphysicians; for it has been far\\r\\nmore the occupation of metaphysicians than of geometers to discuss such\\r\\nquestions as I have stated, the nature of geometrical proofs,\\r\\ngeometrical axioms, the geometrical faculty, and the like.  And if we\\r\\nconstruct a complete system of geometry, it will be almost exactly the\\r\\nsame, whatever be the views which we take on these metaphysical\\r\\nquestions.\" [1]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a system Dr. Whewell wishes to construct in the field of ethics.\\r\\nHis aim is to give us a view of morality in which moral propositions\\r\\nare \"deduced from axioms, by successive steps of reasoning, so far as\\r\\nto form a connected system of moral truth.\"  Such a \"sure and connected\\r\\nknowledge of the duties of man\" would, he thinks, be of the greatest\\r\\nimportance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn accordance with this purpose, Dr. Whewell assumes that humanity,\\r\\njustice, truth, purity, order, earnestness, and moral purpose are\\r\\nfundamental principles of human action; and he thinks that all who\\r\\nadmit as much as this will be able to go on with him in his development\\r\\nof a system of moral rules to govern the life of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would hardly be worth while for me to speak at length of a way of\\r\\ntreating ethics so little likely to be urged upon the attention of the\\r\\nreader who busies himself with the books which are appearing in our own\\r\\nday, were it not that we have here an admirable illustration of the\\r\\nattempt to teach ethics as though it were such a science as geometry.\\r\\nThe shortcomings of the method become very evident to one who reads the\\r\\nwork attentively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we are forced to ask ourselves, have we really a collection of\\r\\nultimate moral principles which are analogous to the axioms of\\r\\ngeometry?  For example, to take but a single instance, Dr. Whewell\\r\\nformulates the Principle of Truth as follows: \"We must conform to the\\r\\nuniversal understanding among men which the use of language\\r\\nimplies\";[2] and he remarks later; \"The rules: _Lie not_, Perform your\\r\\npromise, are of universal validity; and the conceptions of _lie_ and of\\r\\n_promise_ are so simple and distinct that, in general, the rules may be\\r\\ndirectly and easily applied.\" [3]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we are struck by the fact that this affirmation of the universal\\r\\nvalidity of the principle of truth is made in a chapter on \"Cases of\\r\\nConscience,\" in a chapter concerned with what seem to be conflicts\\r\\nbetween duties; and this chapter is followed by one which treats of\\r\\n\"Cases of Necessity,\" _i.e._ cases in which a man is to be regarded as\\r\\njustified in violating common rules when there seems to be urgent\\r\\nreason for so doing.  We are told that the moralist cannot say: Lie\\r\\nnot, except in great emergencies; but must say: Lie not at all.  But we\\r\\nare also told that he must grant that there are cases of necessity in\\r\\nwhich transgressions of moral rules are excusable; and this looks very\\r\\nmuch as if he said: Go on and do the thing while I close my eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hardly seems to give us a \"sure and connected knowledge of the\\r\\nduties of man\" deduced from axiomatic principles.  On what authority\\r\\nshall we suspend for the time being this axiomatic principle or that?\\r\\nIs there some deeper principle which lends to each of them its\\r\\nauthority, and which may, for cause, withdraw it?  There is no hint of\\r\\nsuch in the treatment of ethics which we are considering, and we seem\\r\\nto have on our hands, not so much a science, as a collection of\\r\\npractical rules, of the scope of which we are more or less in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interesting thing to notice is that this view of ethics is very\\r\\nclosely akin to that adapted unconsciously by the majority of the\\r\\npersons we meet who have not interested themselves much in ethics as a\\r\\nscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time that we have reached years of discretion we are all in\\r\\npossession of a considerable number of moral maxims.  We consider it\\r\\nwrong to steal, to lie, to injure our neighbor.  Such maxims lie in our\\r\\nminds side by side, and we do not commonly think of criticising them.\\r\\nBut now and then we face a situation in which one maxim seems to urge\\r\\none course of action and another maxim a contrary one.  Shall we tell\\r\\nthe truth and the whole truth, when so doing will bring grave\\r\\nmisfortune upon an innocent person?  And now and then we are brought to\\r\\nthe realization that all men do not admit the validity of all our\\r\\nmaxims.  Judgments differ as to what is right and what is wrong.  Who\\r\\nshall be the arbiter?  Not infrequently a rough decision is arrived at\\r\\nin the assumption that we have only to interrogate \"conscience\"--in the\\r\\nassumption, in other words, that we carry a watch which can be counted\\r\\nupon to give the correct time, even if the timepieces of our neighbors\\r\\nare not to be depended upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common sense ethics cannot be regarded as very systematic and\\r\\nconsistent, or as very profound.  It is a collection of working rules,\\r\\nof practical maxims; and, although it is impossible to overestimate its\\r\\nvalue as a guide to life, its deficiencies, when it is looked at\\r\\ncritically, become evident, I think, even to thoughtful persons who are\\r\\nnot scientific at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany writers on ethics have simply tried to turn this collection of\\r\\nworking rules into a science, somewhat as Dr. Whewell has done.  This\\r\\nis the peculiar weakness of those who have been called the\\r\\n\"intuitionalists\"--though I must warn the reader against assuming that\\r\\nthis term has but the one meaning, and that all those to whom it has\\r\\nbeen applied should be placed in the same class.  Here it is used to\\r\\nindicate those who maintain that we are directly aware of the validity\\r\\nof certain moral principles, must accept them as ultimate, and need\\r\\nonly concern ourselves with the problem of their application.\\r\\n\\r\\n72. ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY.--When John Locke maintained that there are\\r\\nno \"innate practical principles,\" or innate moral maxims, he pointed in\\r\\nevidence to the \"enormities practiced without remorse\" in different\\r\\nages and by different peoples.  The list he draws up is a curious and\\r\\nan interesting one.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our day it has pretty generally come to be recognized by thoughtful\\r\\nmen that a man\\'s judgments as to right and wrong reflect the phase of\\r\\ncivilization, or the lack of it, which he represents, and that their\\r\\nsignificance cannot be understood when we consider them apart from\\r\\ntheir historic setting.  This means that no man\\'s conscience is set up\\r\\nas an ultimate standard, but that every man\\'s conscience is regarded as\\r\\nfurnishing material which the science of ethics must take into account.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay we, broadening the basis upon which we are to build, and studying\\r\\nthe manners, customs, and moral judgments of all sorts and conditions\\r\\nof men, develop an empirical science of ethics which will be\\r\\nindependent of philosophy?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not seem that we can do this.  We are concerned with\\r\\npsychological phenomena, and their nature and significance are by no\\r\\nmeans beyond dispute.  For example, there is the feeling of moral\\r\\nobligation, of which ethics has so much to say.  What is this feeling,\\r\\nand what is its authority?  Is it a thing to be explained?  Can it\\r\\nimpel a man, let us say, a bigot, to do wrong?  And what can we mean by\\r\\ncredit and discredit, by responsibility and free choice, and other\\r\\nconcepts of the sort?  All this must remain very vague to one who has\\r\\nnot submitted his ethical concepts to reflective analysis of the sort\\r\\nthat we have a right to call philosophical.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it does not seem possible to decide what a man should or\\r\\nshould not do, without taking into consideration the circumstances in\\r\\nwhich he is placed.  The same act may be regarded as benevolent or the\\r\\nreverse according to its context.  If we will but grant the validity of\\r\\nthe premises from which the medieval churchman reasoned, we may well\\r\\nask whether, in laying hands violently upon those who dared to form\\r\\nindependent judgments in matters of religion, he was not\\r\\nconscientiously doing his best for his fellow-man.  He tried by all\\r\\nmeans to save some, and to what he regarded as a most dangerous malady\\r\\nhe applied a drastic remedy.  By what standard shall we judge him?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt that our doctrine of the whole duty of man must\\r\\nbe conditioned by our view of the nature of the world in which man\\r\\nlives and of man\\'s place in the world.  Has ethics nothing to do with\\r\\nreligion?  If we do not believe in God, and if we think that man\\'s life\\r\\nends with the death of the body, it is quite possible that we shall set\\r\\nfor him an ethical standard which we should have to modify if we\\r\\nadopted other beliefs.  The relation of ethics to religion is a problem\\r\\nthat the student of ethics can scarcely set aside.  It seems, then,\\r\\nthat the study of ethics necessarily carries us back to world problems\\r\\nwhich cannot be approached except by the path of philosophical\\r\\nreflection.  We shall see in Chapter XX that the theistic problem\\r\\ncertainly belongs to this class.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is worthy of our consideration that the vast majority of writers on\\r\\nethics have felt strongly that their science runs out into metaphysics.\\r\\nWe can scarcely afford to treat their testimony lightly.  Certainly it\\r\\nis not possible for one who has no knowledge of philosophy to\\r\\nunderstand the significance of the ethical systems which have appeared\\r\\nin the past.  The history of ethics may be looked upon as a part of the\\r\\nhistory of philosophy.  Only on the basis of some general view as to\\r\\nnature and man have men decided what man ought to do.  As we have seen\\r\\nabove, this appears sufficiently reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\n73. AESTHETICS.--Of aesthetics, or the science of the beautiful, I\\r\\nshall say little.  There is somewhat the same reason for including it\\r\\namong the philosophical sciences that there is for including ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have paid little attention to science or to philosophy are\\r\\napt to dogmatize about what is and what is not beautiful just as they\\r\\ndogmatize about what is and what is not right.  They say\\r\\nunhesitatingly; This object is beautiful, and that one is ugly.  It is\\r\\nas if they said: This one is round, and that one square.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften it quite escapes their attention that what they now regard as\\r\\nbeautiful struck them as unattractive a short time before; and will,\\r\\nperhaps, when the ceaseless change of the fashions has driven it out of\\r\\nvogue, seem strange and unattractive once more.  Nor do they reflect\\r\\nupon the fact that others, who seem to have as good a right to an\\r\\nopinion as they, do not agree with them in their judgments; nor upon\\r\\nthe further fact that the standard of beauty is a thing that has varied\\r\\nfrom age to age, differs widely in different countries, and presents\\r\\nminor variations in different classes even in the same community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dogmatic utterances of those who are keenly susceptible to the\\r\\naesthetic aspects of things but are not given to reflection stand in\\r\\nstriking contrast to the epitome of the popular wisdom expressed in the\\r\\nskeptical adage that there is no disputing about tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe cannot interpret this adage broadly and take it literally, for then\\r\\nwe should have to admit that men\\'s judgments as to the beautiful cannot\\r\\nconstitute the material of a science at all, and that there can be no\\r\\nsuch thing as progress in the fine arts.  The notion of progress\\r\\nimplies a standard, and an approximation to an ideal.  Few would dare\\r\\nto deny that there has been progress in such arts as painting and\\r\\nmusic; and when one has admitted so much as this, one has virtually\\r\\nadmitted that a science of aesthetics is, at least, possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe science studies the facts of the aesthetic life as ethics studies\\r\\nthe facts of the moral life.  It can take no man\\'s taste as furnishing\\r\\na standard: it must take every man\\'s taste as a fact of significance.\\r\\nIt is driven to reflective analysis--to such questions as, what is\\r\\nbeauty? and what is meant by aesthetic progress?  It deals with elusive\\r\\npsychological facts the significance of which is not easily grasped.\\r\\nIt is a philosophical science, and is by no means in a position to\\r\\nfollow a beaten path, dispensing with a reflective analysis of its\\r\\nmaterials.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] Preface.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] section 269.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] section 376.\\r\\n\\r\\n[4] \"Essay concerning Human Understanding,\" Book I, Chapter III.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX\\r\\n\\r\\nMETAPHYSICS\\r\\n\\r\\n74. WHAT IS METAPHYSICS?--The reader has probably already remarked that\\r\\nin some of the preceding chapters the adjectives \"metaphysical\" and\\r\\n\"philosophical\" have been used as if they were interchangeable, in\\r\\ncertain connections, at least.  This is justified by common usage; and\\r\\nin the present chapter I shall be expected by no one, I think, to prove\\r\\nthat metaphysics is a philosophical discipline.  My task will rather be\\r\\nto show how far the words \"metaphysics\" and \"philosophy\" have a\\r\\ndifferent meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chapters III to XI, I have given a general view of the problems\\r\\nwhich present themselves to reflective thought, and I have indicated\\r\\nthat they are not problems which can conveniently be distributed among\\r\\nthe several special sciences.  Is there an external world?  What is it?\\r\\nWhat are space and time?  What is the mind?  How are mind and body\\r\\nrelated?  How do we know that there are other minds than ours? etc.\\r\\nThese have been presented as _philosophical_ problems; and when we turn\\r\\nback to the history of speculative thought we find that they are just\\r\\nthe problems with which the men whom we agree to call philosophers have\\r\\nchiefly occupied themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when we turn to our treatises on _metaphysics_, we also find that\\r\\nthese are the problems there discussed.  Such treatises differ much\\r\\namong themselves, and the problems are not presented in the same form\\r\\nor in the same order; but one who can look beneath the surface will\\r\\nfind that the authors are busied with much the same thing--with some or\\r\\nall of the problems above mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow, then, does metaphysics differ from philosophy?  The difference\\r\\nbecomes clear to us when we realize that the word philosophy has a\\r\\nbroader and looser signification, and that metaphysics is, so to speak,\\r\\nthe core, the citadel, of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen (Chapter II) that the world and the mind, as they seem to\\r\\nbe presented in the experience of the plain man, do not stand forth\\r\\nwith such clearness and distinctness that he is able to answer\\r\\nintelligently the questions we wish to ask him regarding their nature.\\r\\nIt is not merely that his information is limited; it is vague and\\r\\nindefinite as well.  And we have seen, too, that, however the special\\r\\nsciences may increase and systematize his information, they do not\\r\\nclear away such vagueness.  The man still uses such concepts as \"inner\"\\r\\nand \"outer,\" \"reality,\" \"the mind,\" \"space,\" and \"time,\" with no very\\r\\ndefinite notion of what they mean.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the attempt to clear away this vagueness by the systematic\\r\\nanalysis of such concepts--in other words, the attempt to make a\\r\\nthorough analysis of our experience--is metaphysics.  The metaphysician\\r\\nstrives to limit his task as well as he may, and to avoid unnecessary\\r\\nexcursions into the fields occupied by the special sciences, even those\\r\\nwhich lie nearest to his own, such as psychology and ethics.  There is\\r\\na sense in which he may be said to be working in the field of a special\\r\\nscience, though he is using as the material for his investigations\\r\\nconcepts which are employed in many sciences; but it is clear that his\\r\\ndiscipline is not a special science in the same sense in which geometry\\r\\nand physics are special sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the special sciences stand, as we have already seen in\\r\\nthe case of several of them, very near to his own.  If he broadens his\\r\\nview, and deliberately determines to take a survey of the field of\\r\\nhuman knowledge as illuminated by the analyses that he has made, he\\r\\nbecomes something more than a _metaphysician_; he becomes a\\r\\n_philosopher_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not in the least mean that he becomes a storehouse of\\r\\nmiscellaneous information, and an authority on all the sciences.\\r\\nSometimes the philosophers have attempted to describe the world of\\r\\nmatter and of mind as though they possessed some mysterious power of\\r\\nknowing things that absolved them from the duty of traveling the weary\\r\\nroad of observation and experiment that has ended in the sciences as we\\r\\nhave them.  When they have done this, they have mistaken the\\r\\nsignificance of their calling.  A philosopher has no more right than\\r\\nanother man to create information out of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is possible, even for one who is not acquainted with the whole\\r\\nbody of facts presented in a science, to take careful note of the\\r\\nassumptions upon which that science rests, to analyze the concepts of\\r\\nwhich it makes use, to mark the methods which it employs, and to gain a\\r\\nfair idea of its scope and of its relation to other sciences.  Such a\\r\\nreflection upon our scientific knowledge is philosophical reflection,\\r\\nand it may result in a classification of the sciences, and in a general\\r\\nview of human knowledge as a whole.  Such a view may be illuminating in\\r\\nthe extreme; it can only be harmful when its significance is\\r\\nmisunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, it may be argued, why may not the man of science do all this for\\r\\nhimself?  Why should he leave it to the philosopher, who is presumably\\r\\nless intimately acquainted with the sciences than he is?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this I answer: The work should, of course, be done by the man who\\r\\nwill do it best.  All our subdivision of labor should be dictated by\\r\\nconvenience.  But I add, that experience has shown that the workers in\\r\\nthe special sciences have not as a rule been very successful when they\\r\\nhave tried to philosophize.\\r\\n\\r\\nScience is an imperious mistress; she demands one\\'s utmost efforts; and\\r\\nwhen a man turns to philosophical reflection merely \"by the way,\" and\\r\\nin the scraps of time at his disposal after the day\\'s work is done, his\\r\\nphilosophical work is apt to be rather superficial.  Moreover, it does\\r\\nnot follow that, because a man is a good mathematician or chemist or\\r\\nphysicist, he is gifted with the power of reflective analysis.  Then,\\r\\ntoo, such men are apt to be imperfectly acquainted with what has been\\r\\ndone in the past; and those who are familiar with the history of\\r\\nphilosophy often have occasion to remark that what is laid before them,\\r\\nin ignorance of the fact that it is neither new nor original, is a\\r\\ndoctrine which has already made its appearance in many forms and has\\r\\nbeen discussed at prodigious length in the centuries gone by.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn certain sciences it seems possible to ignore the past, to a great\\r\\nextent, at least.  What is worth keeping has been kept, and there is a\\r\\nsolid foundation on which to build for the future.  But with reflective\\r\\nthought it is not so.  There is no accepted body of doctrine which we\\r\\nhave the right to regard as unassailable.  We should take it as a safe\\r\\nmaxim that the reflections of men long dead _may_ be profounder and\\r\\nmore worthy of our study than those urged upon our attention by the men\\r\\nof our day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this leads me to make a remark upon the titles given to works on\\r\\nmetaphysics.  It seems somewhat misleading to label them: \"Outlines of\\r\\nMetaphysics\" or \"Elements of Metaphysics.\"  Such titles suggest that we\\r\\nare dealing with a body of doctrine which has met with general\\r\\nacceptance, and may be compared with that found in handbooks on the\\r\\nspecial sciences.  But we should realize that, when we are concerned\\r\\nwith the profounder investigations into the nature of our experience,\\r\\nwe tread upon uncertain ground and many differences of opinion obtain.\\r\\nWe should, if possible, avoid a false semblance of authority.\\r\\n\\r\\n75. EPISTEMOLOGY.--We hear a great deal at the present day of\\r\\nEpistemology, or the Theory of Knowledge.  I have not classed it as a\\r\\ndistinct philosophical science, for reasons which will appear below.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen in Chapter XVI that it is possible to treat of logic in a\\r\\nsimple way without growing very metaphysical; but we have also seen\\r\\nthat when we go deeply into questions touching the nature of evidence\\r\\nand what is meant by truth and falsity, we are carried back to\\r\\nphilosophical reflection at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, for convenience, group together these deeper questions\\r\\nregarding the nature of knowledge and its scope, and call the subject\\r\\nof our study \"Epistemology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it should be remarked, in the first place, that, when we work in\\r\\nthis field, we are exercising a reflective analysis of precisely the\\r\\ntype employed in making the metaphysical analyses contained in the\\r\\nearlier chapters of this book.  We are treating our experience as it is\\r\\nnot treated in common thought and in science.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it should be remarked, in the second place, that the investigation\\r\\nof our knowledge inevitably runs together with an investigation into\\r\\nthe nature of things known, of the mind and the world.  Suppose that I\\r\\ngive the titles of the chapters in Part III of Mr. Hobhouse\\'s able work\\r\\non \"The Theory of Knowledge.\"  They are as follows: Validity; the\\r\\nValidity of Knowledge; the Conception of External Reality; Substance;\\r\\nthe Conception of Self; Reality as a System; Knowledge and Reality; the\\r\\nGrounds of Knowledge and Belief.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre not these topics metaphysical?  Let us ask ourselves how it would\\r\\naffect our views of the validity and of the limits of our knowledge, if\\r\\nwe were converted to the metaphysical doctrines of John Locke, or of\\r\\nBishop Berkeley, or of David Hume, or of Thomas Reid, or of Immanuel\\r\\nKant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, then, regard epistemology as a part of logic--the metaphysical\\r\\npart--or as a part of metaphysics; it does not much matter which we\\r\\ncall it, since we mean the same thing.  But its relation to metaphysics\\r\\nis such that it does not seem worth while to call it a separate\\r\\ndiscipline.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore leaving this subject there is one more point upon which I should\\r\\ntouch, if only to obviate a possible misunderstanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe find in Professor Cornelius\\'s clear little book, \"An Introduction to\\r\\nPhilosophy\" (Leipzig, 1903; it has unhappily not yet been translated\\r\\ninto English), that metaphysics is repudiated altogether, and\\r\\nepistemology is set in its place.  But this rejection of metaphysics\\r\\ndoes not necessarily imply the denial of the value of such an analysis\\r\\nof our experience as I have in this work called metaphysical.\\r\\nMetaphysics is taken to mean, not an analysis of experience, but a\\r\\ngroping behind the veil of phenomena for some reality not given in\\r\\nexperience.  In other words, what Professor Cornelius condemns is what\\r\\nmany of the rest of us also condemn under another name.  What he calls\\r\\nmetaphysics, we call bad metaphysics; and what he calls epistemology,\\r\\nwe call metaphysics.  The dispute is really a dispute touching the\\r\\nproper name to apply to reflective analysis of a certain kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is the fashion in certain quarters to abuse metaphysics, I set\\r\\nthe reader on his guard.  Some kinds of metaphysics certainly ought to\\r\\nbe repudiated under whatever name they may be presented to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION\\r\\n\\r\\n76. RELIGION AND REFLECTION.--A man may be through and through ethical\\r\\nin his thought and feeling, and yet know nothing of the science of\\r\\nethics.  He may be possessed of the finest aesthetic taste, and yet may\\r\\nknow nothing of the science of aesthetics.  It is one thing to be good,\\r\\nand another to know clearly what goodness means; it is one thing to\\r\\nlove the beautiful, and another to know how to define it.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust so a man may be thoroughly religious, and may, nevertheless, have\\r\\nreflected very little upon his religious belief and the foundations\\r\\nupon which it rests.  This does not mean that his belief is without\\r\\nfoundation.  It may have a firm basis or it may not.  But whatever the\\r\\ncase may be, he is not in a position to say much about it.  He _feels_\\r\\nthat he is right, but he cannot prove it.  The man is, I think we must\\r\\nadmit, rather blind as to the full significance of his position, and he\\r\\nis, in consequence, rather helpless.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a man is menaced by certain dangers.  We have seen in the chapter\\r\\non ethics that men are by no means at one in their judgments as to the\\r\\nrightness or wrongness of given actions.  And it requires a very little\\r\\nreflection to teach us that men are not at one in their religious\\r\\nnotions.  God and His nature, the relation of God to man, what the\\r\\nreligious life should be, these things are the subject of much dispute;\\r\\nand some men hold opinions regarded by others as not merely erroneous\\r\\nbut highly pernicious in their influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShall a man simply assume that the opinions which he happens to hold\\r\\nare correct, and that all who differ with him are in error?  He has not\\r\\nframed his opinions quite independently for himself.  We are all\\r\\ninfluenced by what we have inherited from the past, and what we inherit\\r\\nmay be partly erroneous, even if we be right in the main.  Moreover, we\\r\\nare all liable to prejudices, and he who has no means of distinguishing\\r\\nsuch from sober truths may admit into his creed many errors.  The\\r\\nlesson of history is very instructive upon this point.  The fact is\\r\\nthat a man\\'s religious notions reflect the position which he occupies\\r\\nin the development of civilization very much as do his ethical notions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  Even supposing that a man has enlightened notions and is living\\r\\na religious life that the most instructed must approve; if he has never\\r\\nreflected, and has never tried to make clear to himself just what he\\r\\nreally does believe and upon what grounds he believes it, how will it\\r\\nbe with him when his position is attacked by another?  Men are, as I\\r\\nhave said, not at one in these matters, and there are few or none of\\r\\nthe doctrines put forward as religions that have not been attacked\\r\\nagain and again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, those who depend only upon an instinctive feeling may be placed in\\r\\nthe very painful position of seeing no answer to the objections brought\\r\\nagainst them.  What is said may seem plausible; it may even seem true,\\r\\nand is it right for a man to oppose what appears to be the truth?  One\\r\\nmay be shocked and pained, and may feel that he who makes the assault\\r\\n_cannot_ be right, and yet may be forced to admit that a relentless\\r\\nlogic, or what presents itself as such, has every appearance of\\r\\nestablishing the repellent truth that robs one of one\\'s dearest\\r\\npossession.  The situation is an unendurable one; it is that of the man\\r\\nwho guards a treasure and recognizes that there is no lock on the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely, if there is error mixed with truth in our religious beliefs, it\\r\\nis desirable that we should have some way of distinguishing between the\\r\\ntruth and the error.  And if our beliefs really have a foundation, it\\r\\nis desirable that we should know what that foundation is, and should\\r\\nnot be at the mercy of every passer-by who takes the notion to throw a\\r\\nstone at us.  But these desirable ends, it seems clear, cannot be\\r\\nattained without reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\n77. THE PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION.--The reflection that busies itself with\\r\\nthese things results in what is called the philosophy of religion.  To\\r\\nshow that the name is an appropriate one and that we are concerned with\\r\\na philosophical discipline, I shall take up for a moment the idea of\\r\\nGod, which most men will admit has a very important place in our\\r\\nconception of religion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes God exist?  We may feel very sure that He does, and yet be forced\\r\\nto admit that the evidence of His existence is not so clear and\\r\\nundeniable as to compel the assent of every one.  We do not try to\\r\\nprove the existence of the men we meet and who talk to us.  No one\\r\\nthinks of denying their existence; it is taken for granted.  Even the\\r\\nmetaphysician, when he takes up and discusses the question whether we\\r\\ncan prove the existence of any mind beyond our own, does not seriously\\r\\ndoubt whether there are other minds or not.  It is not so much what we\\r\\nknow, as how we know it, that interests him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with the existence of God it is different.  That men do not think\\r\\nthat an examination of the evidence can be dispensed with is evident\\r\\nfrom the books that are written and lectures that are delivered year\\r\\nafter year.  There seem to be honest differences of opinion, and we\\r\\nfeel compelled to offer men proofs--to show that belief is reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall we determine whether this world in which we live is such a\\r\\nworld that we may take it as a revelation of God?  And of what sort of\\r\\na Being are we speaking when we use the word \"God\"?  The question is\\r\\nnot an idle one, for men\\'s conceptions have differed widely.  There is\\r\\nthe savage, with a conception that strikes the modern civilized man as\\r\\naltogether inadequate; there is the thoughtful man of our day, who has\\r\\ninherited the reflections of those who have lived in the ages gone by.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there is the philosopher, or, perhaps, I should rather say, there\\r\\nare the philosophers.  Have they not conceived of God as a group of\\r\\nabstract notions, or as a something that may best be described as the\\r\\nUnknowable, or as the Substance which is the identity of thought and\\r\\nextension, or as the external world itself?  All have not sinned in\\r\\nthis way, but some have, and they are not men whom we can ignore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we turn from all such notions and, in harmony with the faith of the\\r\\ngreat body of religious men in the ages past, some of whom were\\r\\nphilosophers but most of whom were not, cling close to the notion that\\r\\nGod is a mind or spirit, and must be conceived according to the\\r\\nanalogy, at least, of the human mind, the mind we most directly\\r\\nknow--if we do this, we are still confronted by problems to which the\\r\\nthoughtful man cannot refuse attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do we mean by a mind?  This is a question to which one can\\r\\nscarcely give an intelligent answer unless one has exercised one\\'s\\r\\nfaculty of philosophic reflection.  And upon what sort of evidence does\\r\\none depend in establishing the existence of minds other than one\\'s own?\\r\\nThis has been discussed at length in Chapter X, and the problem is\\r\\ncertainly a metaphysical one.  And if we believe that the Divine Mind\\r\\nis not subject to the limitations which confine the human, how shall we\\r\\nconceive it?  The question is an important one.  Some of the\\r\\nphilosophers and theologians who have tried to free the Divine Mind\\r\\nfrom such limitations have taken away every positive mark by which we\\r\\nrecognize a mind to be such, and have left us a naked \"Absolute\" which\\r\\nis no better than a labeled vacuum.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, we cannot refuse to consider the question of God\\'s relation\\r\\nto the world.  This seems to lead back to the broader question: How are\\r\\nwe to conceive of any mind as related to the world?  What is the\\r\\nrelation between mind and matter?  If any subject of inquiry may\\r\\nproperly be called metaphysical, surely this may be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe see, then, that there is little wonder that the thoughtful\\r\\nconsideration of the facts and doctrines of religion has taken its\\r\\nplace among the philosophical sciences.  Aesthetics has been called\\r\\napplied psychology; and I think it is scarcely too much to say that we\\r\\nare here concerned with applied metaphysics, with the attempt to obtain\\r\\na clear understanding of the significance of the facts of religion in\\r\\nthe light of those ultimate analyses which reveal to us the real nature\\r\\nof the world of matter and of minds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI\\r\\n\\r\\nPHILOSOPHY AND THE OTHER SCIENCES\\r\\n\\r\\n78. THE PHILOSOPHICAL AND NON-PHILOSOPHICAL SCIENCES.--We have seen in\\r\\nthe preceding chapters that certain of the sciences can scarcely be\\r\\ncultivated successfully in complete separation from philosophy.  It has\\r\\nalso been indicated in various places that the relation of other\\r\\nsciences to philosophy is not so close.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the sciences of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry may be\\r\\nsuccessfully prosecuted by a man who has reflected little upon the\\r\\nnature of numbers and who has never asked himself seriously what he\\r\\nmeans by space.  The assumptions which he is justified in making, and\\r\\nthe kind of operations which he has the right to perform, do not seem,\\r\\nas a rule, to be in doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it is also in the sciences of chemistry and physics.  There is\\r\\nnothing to prevent the chemist or the physicist from being a\\r\\nphilosopher, but he is not compelled to be one.  He may push forward\\r\\nthe investigations proper to his profession regardless of the type of\\r\\nphilosophy which it pleases him to adopt.  Whether he be a realist or\\r\\nan idealist, a dualist or a monist, he should, as chemist or physicist,\\r\\ntreat the same sort of facts in the same sort of a way.  His path\\r\\nappears to be laid out for him, and he can do work the value of which\\r\\nis undisputed by traveling quietly along it, and without stopping to\\r\\nconsider consciously what kind of a path it is.  There are many who\\r\\nwork in this way, and they succeed in making important contributions to\\r\\nhuman knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch sciences as these I call the non-philosophical sciences to\\r\\ndistinguish them from the group of sciences I have been discussing at\\r\\nlength.  What marks them out is, that the facts with which the\\r\\ninvestigator has to deal are known by him with sufficient clearness to\\r\\nleave him usually in little doubt as to the use which he can make of\\r\\nthem.  His knowledge is clear enough for the purpose in hand, and his\\r\\nwork is justified by its results.  What is the relation of such\\r\\nsciences as these to philosophy?\\r\\n\\r\\n79. THE STUDY OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES AND METHODS.--It is one thing to\\r\\nhave the instinct of the investigator and to be able to feel one\\'s way\\r\\nalong the road that leads to new knowledge of a given kind, and it is\\r\\nanother thing to have the reflective turn of mind that makes one\\r\\nclearly conscious of just what one has been doing and how one has been\\r\\ndoing it.  Men reasoned before there was a science of logic, and the\\r\\nsciences made their appearance before what may be called the logic of\\r\\nthe sciences had its birth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It may be truly asserted,\" writes Professor Jevons,[1] \"that the rapid\\r\\nprogress of the physical sciences during the last three centuries has\\r\\nnot been accompanied by a corresponding advance in the theory of\\r\\nreasoning.  Physicists speak familiarly of Scientific Method, but they\\r\\ncould not readily describe what they mean by that expression.\\r\\nProfoundly engaged in the study of particular classes of natural\\r\\nphenomena, they are usually too much engrossed in the immense and ever\\r\\naccumulating details of their special sciences to generalize upon the\\r\\nmethods of reasoning which they unconsciously employ.  Yet few will\\r\\ndeny that these methods of reasoning ought to be studied, especially by\\r\\nthose who endeavor to introduce scientific order into less successful\\r\\nand methodical branches of knowledge.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Jevons suggests that it is lack of time and attention that\\r\\nprevents the scientific investigator from attaining to a clear\\r\\nconception of what is meant by scientific method.  This has something\\r\\nto do with it, but I think we may also maintain that the work of the\\r\\ninvestigator and that of the critic are somewhat different in kind, and\\r\\nrequire somewhat different powers of mind.  We find a parallel to this\\r\\nelsewhere.  Both in literature and in art men may be in the best sense\\r\\nproductive, and yet may be poor critics.  We are often wofully\\r\\ndisappointed when we attend a lecture on poetry by a poet, or one on\\r\\npainting by an artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said: If what is maintained above regarding the possibility\\r\\nof prosecuting scientific researches without having recourse to\\r\\nreflective thought is true, why should the man of science care whether\\r\\nthe principles and methods of the non-philosophical sciences are\\r\\ninvestigated or are merely taken for granted?\\r\\n\\r\\nI answer: It should be observed that the statements made in the last\\r\\nsection were somewhat guarded.  I have used the expressions \"as a rule\"\\r\\nand \"usually.\"  I have spoken thus because one can work in the way\\r\\ndescribed, without danger of error, only where a beaten track has been\\r\\nattained and is followed.  In Chapter XVI it was pointed out that even\\r\\nin the mathematical sciences one may be forced to reflect upon the\\r\\nsignificance of one\\'s symbols.  As I write this, a pamphlet comes to\\r\\nhand which is concerned to prove that \"every cause is potentially\\r\\ncapable of producing several effects,\" and proves it by claiming that\\r\\nthe square root of four ([square root symbol]4) is a _cause_ which may\\r\\nhave as _effect_ either two (2) or minus two (-2).\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this mathematical reasoning?  Are mathematical relations ever those\\r\\nof cause and effect?  And may one on the basis of such reasonings claim\\r\\nthat in nature the relation of cause and effect is not a fixed and\\r\\ninvariable one?\\r\\n\\r\\nEven where there is a beaten track, there is some danger that men may\\r\\nwander from it.  And on the confines of our knowledge there are fields\\r\\nin which the accepted road is yet to be established.  Science makes\\r\\nconstant use of hypotheses as an aid to investigation.  What hypotheses\\r\\nmay one frame, and what are inadmissible?  How important an\\r\\ninvestigation of this question may be to the worker in certain branches\\r\\nof science will be clear to one who will read with attention Professor\\r\\nPoincar\\xc3\\xa9\\'s brilliant little work on \"Science and Hypothesis.\" [2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no field in art, literature, or science in which the work of\\r\\nthe critic is wholly superfluous.  \"There are periods in the growth of\\r\\nscience,\" writes Professor Pearson in his deservedly popular work, \"The\\r\\nGrammar of Science,\" [3] \"when it is well to turn our attention from\\r\\nits imposing superstructure and to examine carefully its foundations.\\r\\nThe present book is primarily intended as a criticism of the\\r\\nfundamental concepts of modern science, and as such finds its\\r\\njustification in the motto placed upon its title-page.\"  The motto in\\r\\nquestion is a quotation from the French philosopher Cousin: \"Criticism\\r\\nis the life of science.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have seen in Chapter XVI that a work on logic may be a comparatively\\r\\nsimple thing.  It may describe the ways in which men reason when they\\r\\nreason correctly, and may not go deep into metaphysical questions.  On\\r\\nthe other hand, it may be deeply metaphysical.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we approach the part of logic which deals with the principles and\\r\\nmethods of the sciences, this difference is forced upon our attention.\\r\\nOne may set forth the assumptions upon which a science rests, and may\\r\\ndescribe the methods of investigation employed, without going much\\r\\nbelow the plane of common thought.  As a type of such works I may\\r\\nmention the useful treatise by Professor Jevons cited earlier in this\\r\\nchapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, our investigations may be more profound, and we may\\r\\nscrutinize the very foundations upon which a science rests.  Both the\\r\\nother works referred to illustrate this method of procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, in \"The Grammar of Science,\" we find our author\\r\\ndiscussing, under the title \"The Facts of Science,\" such problems as\\r\\nthe following: the Reality of Things; Sense-impressions and\\r\\nConsciousness; the Nature of Thought; the External Universe; Sensations\\r\\nas the Ultimate Source of the Materials of Knowledge; and the Futility\\r\\nof \"Things-in-themselves.\"  The philosophical character of such\\r\\ndiscussions does not need to be pointed out at length.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[1] \"The Principles Of Science,\" London, 1874, Preface.\\r\\n\\r\\n[2] English translation, New York, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n[3] Second edition, London, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVI. ON THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VALUE OF THE STUDY OF PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\n80. THE QUESTION OF PRACTICAL UTILITY.--Why should men study\\r\\nphilosophy?  The question is a natural one, for man is a rational\\r\\nbeing, and when the worth of a thing is not at once evident to him, he\\r\\nusually calls for proof of its worth.  Our professional schools, with\\r\\nthe exception of schools of theology, usually pay little attention to\\r\\nphilosophical studies; but such studies occupy a strong position in our\\r\\ncolleges, and a vast number of persons not students in the technical\\r\\nsense think it worth while to occupy themselves with them more or less.\\r\\nWherever liberal studies are prosecuted they have their place, and it\\r\\nis an honored place.  Is this as it should be?\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore we ask whether any given study is of practical value, it is wise\\r\\nto determine what the word \"practical\" shall be taken to mean.  Shall\\r\\nwe say that we may call practical only such learning as can be turned\\r\\nto direct account in earning money later?  If we restrict the meaning\\r\\nof the word in this way, we seem to strike a blow at liberal studies in\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, no one would think of maintaining that the study of mathematics\\r\\nis not of practical value--sometimes and to some persons.  The\\r\\nphysicist and the engineer need to know a good deal about mathematics.\\r\\nBut how is it with the merchant, the lawyer, the clergyman, the\\r\\nphysician?  How much of their algebra, geometry, and trigonometry do\\r\\nthese remember after they have become absorbed in the practice of their\\r\\nseveral callings, and how often do they find it necessary to use\\r\\nanything beyond certain simple rules of arithmetic?\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes we are tempted to condemn the study of the classics as\\r\\nunpractical, and to turn instead to the modern languages and to the\\r\\nphysical sciences.  Now, it is, of course, a fair question to ask what\\r\\nshould and what should not be regarded as forming part of a liberal\\r\\neducation, and I shall make no effort to decide the question here.  But\\r\\nit should be borne well in mind that one cannot decide it by\\r\\ndetermining what studies are practical in the sense of the word under\\r\\ndiscussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we keep strictly to this sense, the modern languages are to the\\r\\nmajority of Americans of little more practical value than are the Latin\\r\\nand Greek.  We scarcely need them except when we travel abroad, and\\r\\nwhen we do that we find that the concierge and the waiter use English\\r\\nwith surprising fluency.  As for the sciences, those who expect to earn\\r\\na living through a knowledge of them, seek, as a rule, that knowledge\\r\\nin a technical or professional school, and the rest of us can enjoy the\\r\\nfruit of their labors without sharing them.  It is a popular fallacy\\r\\nthat because certain studies have a practical value to the world at\\r\\nlarge, they must necessarily have a practical value to every one, and\\r\\ncan be recommended to the individual on that account.  It is worth\\r\\nwhile to sit down quietly and ask oneself how many of the bits of\\r\\ninformation acquired during the course of a liberal education are\\r\\ndirectly used in the carrying on of a given business or in the practice\\r\\nof a given profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, we all believe that liberal education is a good thing for\\r\\nthe individual and for the race.  One must not too much restrict the\\r\\nmeaning of the word \"practical.\"  A civilized state composed of men who\\r\\nknow nothing save what has a direct bearing upon their especial work in\\r\\nlife is an absurdity; it cannot exist.  There must be a good deal of\\r\\ngeneral enlightenment and there must be a considerable number of\\r\\nindividuals who have enjoyed a high measure of enlightenment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis becomes clear if we consider the part played in the life of the\\r\\nstate by the humblest tradesman.  If he is to be successful, he must be\\r\\nable to read, write, and keep his accounts, and make, let us say,\\r\\nshoes.  But when we have said this, we have summed him up as a workman,\\r\\nbut not as a man, and he is also a man.  He may marry, and make a good\\r\\nor a bad husband, and a good or a bad father.  He stands in relations\\r\\nto his neighborhood, to the school, and to the church; and he is not\\r\\nwithout his influence.  He may be temperate or intemperate, frugal or\\r\\nextravagant, law-abiding or the reverse.  He has his share, and no\\r\\nsmall share, in the government of his city and of his state.  His\\r\\ninfluence is indeed far-reaching, and that it may be an influence for\\r\\ngood, he is in need of all the intellectual and moral enlightenment\\r\\nthat we can give him.  It is of the utmost practical utility to the\\r\\nstate that he should know a vast number of things which have no direct\\r\\nbearing upon the making and mending of shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if this is true in the case of the tradesman, it is scarcely\\r\\nnecessary to point out that the physician, the lawyer, the clergyman,\\r\\nand the whole army of those whom we regard as the leaders of men and\\r\\nthe molders of public opinion have spheres of non-professional activity\\r\\nof great importance to the state.  They cannot be mere specialists if\\r\\nthey would.  They must influence society for good or ill; and if they\\r\\nare ignorant and unenlightened, their influence cannot be good.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we consider the life of man in a broad way, we see how essential\\r\\nit is that many men should be brought to have a share in what has been\\r\\ngained by the long travail of the centuries past.  It will not do to\\r\\nask at every step whether they can put to direct professional use every\\r\\nbit of information gained.  Literature and science, sweetness and\\r\\nlight, beauty and truth, these are the heritage of the modern world;\\r\\nand unless these permeate its very being, society must undergo\\r\\ndegeneration.  It is this conviction that has led to the high\\r\\nappreciation accorded by intelligent men to courses of liberal study,\\r\\nand among such courses those which we have recognized as philosophical\\r\\nmust take their place.\\r\\n\\r\\n81. WHY PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES ARE USEFUL.--But let us ask a little more\\r\\nspecifically what is to be gained by pursuing distinctively\\r\\nphilosophical studies.  Why should those who go to college, or\\r\\nintelligent persons who cannot go to college, care to interest\\r\\nthemselves in logic and ethics, psychology and metaphysics?  Are not\\r\\nthese studies rather dry, in the first place, and rather profitless, in\\r\\nthe second?\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the first point, I should stoutly maintain that if they are dry,\\r\\nit is somebody\\'s fault.  The most sensational of novels would be dry if\\r\\ncouched in the language which some philosophers have seen fit to use in\\r\\nexpressing their thoughts.  He who defines \"existence\" as \"the still\\r\\nand simple precipitate of the oscillation between beginning to be and\\r\\nceasing to be\" has done his best to alienate our affections from the\\r\\nsubject of his predilection.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not in the least necessary to talk in this way about matters\\r\\nphilosophical.  He who is not a slave to tradition can use plain and\\r\\nsimple language.  To be sure, there are some subjects, especially in\\r\\nthe field of metaphysics, into which the student cannot expect to see\\r\\nvery deeply at the outset of his studies.  Men do not expect to\\r\\nunderstand the more difficult problems of mathematics without making a\\r\\ngood deal of preparation; but, unhappily, they sometimes expect to have\\r\\nthe profoundest problems of metaphysics made luminous to them in one or\\r\\ntwo popular lectures.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical studies are not dry, when men are properly taught, and\\r\\nare in a position to understand what is said.  They deal with the most\\r\\nfascinating of problems.  It is only necessary to pierce through the\\r\\nhusk of words which conceals the thoughts of the philosopher, and we\\r\\nshall find the kernel palatable, indeed.  Nor are such studies\\r\\nprofitless, to take up our second point.  Let us see what we may gain\\r\\nfrom them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us begin with logic--the traditional logic commonly taught to\\r\\nbeginners.  Is it worth while to study this?  Surely it is.  No one who\\r\\nhas not tried to introduce the average under-graduate to logic can\\r\\nrealize how blindly he uses his reasoning powers, how unconscious he is\\r\\nof the full meaning of the sentences he employs, how easily he may be\\r\\nentrapped by fallacious reasonings where he is not set on his guard by\\r\\nsome preposterous conclusion touching matters with which he is familiar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he is not merely unconscious of the lapses in his processes of\\r\\nreasoning, and of his imperfect comprehension of the significance of\\r\\nhis statements; he is unconscious also of the mass of inherited and\\r\\nacquired prejudices, often quite indefensible, which he unquestioningly\\r\\nemploys as premises.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe fairly represents the larger world beyond the walls of the college.\\r\\nIt is a world in which prejudices are assumed as premises, and loose\\r\\nreasonings pass current and are unchallenged until they beget some\\r\\nunpalatable conclusion.  It is a world in which men take little pains\\r\\nto think carefully and accurately unless they are dealing with\\r\\nsomething touching which it is practically inconvenient to make a\\r\\nmistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who studies logic in the proper way is not filling his mind with\\r\\nuseless facts; he is simply turning the light upon his own thinking\\r\\nmind, and realizing more clearly what he has always done rather blindly\\r\\nand blunderingly.  He may completely forget the\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferioque prioris,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nand he may be quite unable to give an account of the moods and figures\\r\\nof the syllogism; but he cannot lose the critical habit if he once has\\r\\nacquired it, and he cannot but be on his guard against himself as well\\r\\nas against others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a keen pleasure in gaining such insight.  It gives a feeling\\r\\nof freedom and power, and rids one of that horrid sense that, although\\r\\nthis or that bit of reasoning is certainly bad, it is impossible to\\r\\ntell just what is the matter with it.  And as for its practical\\r\\nutility, if it is desirable to get rid of prejudice and confusion, and\\r\\nto possess a clear and reasonable mind, then anything that makes for\\r\\nthis must be of value.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the desirability that all who can afford the luxury of a liberal\\r\\neducation should do some serious reading in ethics, it seems hardly\\r\\nnecessary to speak.  The deficiencies of the ethics of the unreflective\\r\\nhave already been touched upon in Chapter XVIII.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I cannot forbear dwelling upon it again.  What thoughtful man is\\r\\nnot struck with the variety of ethical standards which obtain in the\\r\\nsame community?  The clergyman who has a strong sense of responsibility\\r\\nfor the welfare of his flock is sometimes accused of not sufficiently\\r\\nrealizing the importance of a frank expression of the whole truth about\\r\\nthings; the man of science, whose duty it seems to be to peer into the\\r\\nmysteries of the universe, and to tell what he sees or what he guesses,\\r\\nis accused of an indifference to the effect which his utterances may\\r\\nhave upon the less enlightened who hear him speak; many criticise the\\r\\nlawyer for a devotion to the interests of his client which is at times\\r\\nin doubtful harmony with the interests of justice in the larger sense;\\r\\nin the business world commercial integrity is exalted, and lapses from\\r\\nthe ethical code which do not assail this cardinal virtue are not\\r\\nalways regarded with equal seriousness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is as though men elected to worship at the shrine of a particular\\r\\nsaint, and were inclined to overlook the claims of others.  For all\\r\\nthis there is, of course, a reason; such things are never to be looked\\r\\nupon as mere accident.  But this does not mean that these more or less\\r\\nconflicting standards are all to be accepted as satisfactory and as\\r\\nultimate.  It is inevitable that those who study ethics seriously, who\\r\\nreally reflect upon ethical problems, should sometimes criticise the\\r\\njudgments of their fellow-men rather unfavorably.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf such independent criticism many persons have a strong distrust.  I\\r\\nam reminded here of an eminent mathematician who maintained that the\\r\\nstudy of ethics has a tendency to distort the student\\'s judgments as to\\r\\nwhat is right and what is wrong.  He had observed that there is apt to\\r\\nbe some divergence of opinion between those who think seriously upon\\r\\nmorals and those who do not, and he gave the preference to the\\r\\nunthinking majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there is undoubtedly danger that the independent thinker may be\\r\\nbetrayed into eccentricities of opinion which are unjustifiable and are\\r\\neven dangerous.  But it seems a strange doctrine that it is, on the\\r\\nwhole, safer not to think, but rather to drift on the stream of public\\r\\nopinion.  In other fields we are not inclined to believe that the\\r\\nignorant man, who has given no especial attention to a subject, is the\\r\\none likely to be right.  Why should it be so in morals?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the youth who goes to college to seek a liberal education has a\\r\\nneed of ethical studies becomes very plain when we come to a\\r\\nrealization of the curious limitations of his ethical training as\\r\\npicked up from his previous experience of the world.  He has some very\\r\\ndefinite notions as to right and wrong.  He is as ready to maintain the\\r\\ndesirability of benevolence, justice, and veracity, as was Bishop\\r\\nButler, who wrote the famous \"Analogy \"; although, to be sure, he is\\r\\nmost inarticulate when called upon to explain what constitutes\\r\\nbenevolence, justice, or veracity.  But the strangest thing is, that he\\r\\nseems to place some of the most important decisions of his whole life\\r\\nquite outside the realm of right and wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe may admit that a man should not undertake to be a clergyman, unless\\r\\nhe possesses certain qualifications of mind and character which\\r\\nevidently qualify him for that profession.  But he does not see why he\\r\\nhas not the right to become a wearisome professor or an incompetent\\r\\nphysician, if he chooses to enter upon such a career.  Is a man not\\r\\nfree to take up what profession he pleases?  He must take the risk, of\\r\\ncourse; but if he fails, he fails.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he is asked to consider from the point of view of ethics the\\r\\nquestion of marriage and its responsibilities, he is at first inclined\\r\\nto consider the whole subject as rather a matter for jest.  Has a man\\r\\nnot the right to marry or remain single exactly as he pleases?  And is\\r\\nhe not free to marry any one whom he can persuade to accept him?  To be\\r\\nsure, he should be a little careful about marrying quite out of his\\r\\nclass, and he should not be hopelessly careless about money matters.\\r\\nThus, a decision, which may affect his whole life as much as any other\\r\\nthat he can be called upon to make, which may practically make it or\\r\\nmar it, is treated as though it were not a matter of grave concern, but\\r\\na private affair, entailing no serious consequences to any one and\\r\\ncalling for no reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish it could be said that the world outside of the college regarded\\r\\nthese matters in another light.  But the student faithfully represents\\r\\nthe opinions current in the community from which he comes.  And he\\r\\nrepresents, unhappily, the teachings of the stage and of the world of\\r\\ncurrent fiction.  The influence of these is too often on the side of\\r\\ninconsiderate passion, which stirs our sympathy and which lends itself\\r\\nto dramatic effect.  With the writers of romance the ethical\\r\\nphilosophers have an ancient quarrel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be said: But the world gets along very well as it is, and\\r\\nwithout brooding too much upon ethical problems.  To this we may\\r\\nanswer: Does the world get along so very well, after all?  Are there no\\r\\nevils that foresight and some firmness of character might have\\r\\nobviated?  And when we concern ourselves with the educated classes, at\\r\\nleast, the weight of whose influence is enormous, is it too much to\\r\\nmaintain that they should do some reading and thinking in the field of\\r\\nethics? should strive to attain to clear vision and correct judgment on\\r\\nthe whole subject of man\\'s duties?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at the present time, when psychological studies have so great a\\r\\nvogue, one scarcely feels compelled to make any sort of an apology for\\r\\nthem.  It is assumed on all hands that it is desirable to study\\r\\npsychology, and courses of lectures are multiplied in all quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably some of this interest has its root in the fallacy touched upon\\r\\nearlier in this chapter.  The science of psychology has revolutionized\\r\\neducational theory.  When those of us who have arrived at middle life\\r\\nlook back and survey the tedious and toilsome path along which we were\\r\\nunwillingly driven in our schoolboy days, and then see how smooth and\\r\\npleasant it has been made since, we are impelled to honor all who have\\r\\ncontributed to this result.  Moreover, it seems very clear that\\r\\nteachers of all grades should have some acquaintance with the nature of\\r\\nthe minds that they are laboring to develop, and that they should not\\r\\nbe left to pick up their information for themselves--a task\\r\\nsufficiently difficult to an unobservant person.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese considerations furnish a sufficient ground for extolling the\\r\\nscience of psychology, and for insisting that studies in it should form\\r\\nsome part of the education of a teacher.  But why should the rest of us\\r\\ncare for such studies?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo this one may answer, in the first place, that nearly all of us have,\\r\\nor ought to have, some responsibility for the education of children;\\r\\nand, in the second, that we deal with the minds of others every day in\\r\\nevery walk in life, and it can certainly do no harm to have our\\r\\nattention called to the way in which minds function.  To be sure, some\\r\\nmen are by nature tactful, and instinctively conscious of how things\\r\\nstrike the minds of those about them.  But even such persons may gain\\r\\nhelpful suggestions, and, at least, have the habit of attention to the\\r\\nmental processes of others confirmed in them.  How often we are\\r\\nimpressed at church, at the public lecture, and in private\\r\\nconversations, with the fact that the speaker lives in blissful\\r\\nunconsciousness of what can be understood by or can possibly interest\\r\\nhis hearers!  For the confirmed bore, there is, perhaps, no cure; but\\r\\nit seems as though something might be done for those who are afflicted\\r\\nto a minor degree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this brings me to another consideration, which is that a proper\\r\\nstudy of psychology ought to be of service in revealing to a man his\\r\\nown nature.  It should show him what he is, and this is surely a first\\r\\nstep toward becoming something better.  It is wonderful how blind men\\r\\nmay be with regard to what passes in their own minds and with regard to\\r\\ntheir own peculiarities.  When they learn to reflect, they come to a\\r\\nclearer consciousness of themselves--it is as though a lamp were\\r\\nlighted within them.  One may, it is true, study psychology without\\r\\nattaining to any of the good results suggested above; but, for that\\r\\nmatter, there is no study which may not be pursued in a profitless way,\\r\\nif the teacher be sufficiently unskilled and the pupil sufficiently\\r\\nthoughtless.\\r\\n\\r\\n82. METAPHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION.--Perhaps it will be said:\\r\\nFor such philosophical studies as the above a good defense may perhaps\\r\\nbe made, but can one defend in the same way the plunge into the\\r\\nobscurities of metaphysics?  In this field no two men seem to be wholly\\r\\nagreed, and if they were, what would it signify?  Whether we call\\r\\nourselves monists or dualists, idealists or realists, Lockians or\\r\\nKantians, must we not live and deal with the things about us in much\\r\\nthe same way?\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have dipped into metaphysical studies deeply enough to see\\r\\nwhat the problems discussed really are; who have been able to reach the\\r\\nideas concealed, too often, under a rather forbidding terminology; who\\r\\nare not of the dogmatic turn of mind which insists upon unquestioned\\r\\nauthority and is repelled by the uncertainties which must confront\\r\\nthose who give themselves to reflective thought,--these will hardly\\r\\nneed to be persuaded that it is desirable to give some attention to the\\r\\nquestion: What sort of a world, after all, is this world in which we\\r\\nlive?  What is its meaning?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many men the impulse to peer into these things is over-powering, and\\r\\nthe pleasure of feeling their insight deepen is extremely keen.  What\\r\\ndeters us in most instances is not the conviction that such\\r\\ninvestigations are not, or should not be, interesting, but rather the\\r\\ndifficulty of the approach.  It is not easy to follow the path which\\r\\nleads from the world of common thought into the world of philosophical\\r\\nreflection.  One becomes bewildered and discouraged at the outset.\\r\\nSometimes, after listening to the directions of guides who disagree\\r\\namong themselves, we are tempted to believe that there can be no\\r\\ncertain path to the goal which we have before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, whatever the difficulties and uncertainties of our task, a little\\r\\nreflection must show that it is not one which has no significance for\\r\\nhuman life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen can, it is true, eat and sleep and go through the routine of the\\r\\nday, without giving thought to science or religion or philosophy, but\\r\\nfew will defend such an existence.  As a matter of fact, those who have\\r\\nattained to some measure of intellectual and moral development do\\r\\nassume, consciously or unconsciously, some rather definite attitude\\r\\ntoward life, and this is not independent of their conviction as to what\\r\\nthe world is and means.\\r\\n\\r\\nMetaphysical speculations run out into the philosophy of religion; and,\\r\\non the other hand, religious emotions and ideals have again and again\\r\\nprompted men to metaphysical construction.  A glance at history shows\\r\\nthat it is natural to man to embrace some attitude toward the system of\\r\\nthings, and to try to justify this by reasoning.  Vigorous and\\r\\nindependent minds have given birth to theories, and these have been\\r\\nadopted by others.  The influence of such theories upon the evolution\\r\\nof humanity has been enormous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIdeas have ruled and still rule the world, some of them very abstract\\r\\nideas.  It does not follow that one is uninfluenced by them, when one\\r\\nhas no knowledge of their source or of their original setting.  They\\r\\nbecome part of the intellectual heritage of us all, and we sometimes\\r\\nsuppose that we are responsible for them ourselves.  Has not the fact\\r\\nthat an idealistic or a materialistic type of thought has been current\\r\\nat a particular time influenced the outlook on life of many who have\\r\\nthemselves devoted little attention to philosophy?  It would be\\r\\ninteresting to know how many, to whom Spencer is but a name, have felt\\r\\nthe influence of the agnosticism of which he was the apostle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say this without meaning to criticise here any of the types of\\r\\ndoctrine referred to.  My thesis is only that philosophy and life go\\r\\nhand in hand, and that the prying into the deeper mysteries of the\\r\\nuniverse cannot be regarded as a matter of no practical moment.  Its\\r\\nimportance ought to be admitted even by the man who has little hope\\r\\nthat he will himself be able to attain to a doctrine wholly\\r\\nsatisfactory and wholly unshakable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor, if the study of the problems of metaphysics does nothing else for\\r\\na given individual, it, at least, enables him to comprehend and\\r\\ncriticise intelligently the doctrines which are presented for his\\r\\nacceptance by others.  It is a painful thing to feel quite helpless in\\r\\nthe face of plausible reasonings which may threaten to rob us of our\\r\\nmost cherished hopes, or may tend to persuade us of the vanity of what\\r\\nwe have been accustomed to regard as of highest worth.  If we are quite\\r\\nunskilled in the examination of such doctrines, we may be captured by\\r\\nthe loosest of arguments--witness the influence of Spencer\\'s argument\\r\\nfor the \"Unknowable,\" in the \"First Principles\"; and if we are ignorant\\r\\nof the history of speculative thought, we may be carried away by old\\r\\nand exploded notions which pose as modern and impressive only because\\r\\nthey have been given a modern dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can, of course, refuse to listen to those who would talk with us.\\r\\nBut this savors of bigotry, and the world will certainly not grow\\r\\nwiser, if men generally cultivate a blind adherence to the opinions in\\r\\nwhich they happen to be brought up.  A cautious conservatism is one\\r\\nthing, and blind obstinacy is another.  To the educated man (and it is\\r\\nprobable that others will have to depend on opinions taken at second\\r\\nhand) a better way of avoiding error is open.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, it will not do to overlook the broadening influence of such\\r\\nstudies as we are discussing.  How dogmatically men are in the habit of\\r\\nexpressing themselves upon those obscure and difficult problems which\\r\\ndeal with matters that lie on the confines of human knowledge!  Such an\\r\\nassumption of knowledge cannot but make us uncomprehending and\\r\\nunsympathetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many subjects upon which, if we hold an opinion at all, we\\r\\nshould hold it tentatively, waiting for more light, and retaining a\\r\\nwillingness to be enlightened.  Many a bitter and fruitless quarrel\\r\\nmight be avoided, if more persons found it possible to maintain this\\r\\nphilosophical attitude of mind.  Philosophy is, after all, reflection,\\r\\nand the reflective man must realize that he is probably as liable to\\r\\nerror as are other men.  He is not infallible, nor has the limit of\\r\\nhuman knowledge been attained in his day and generation.  He who\\r\\nrealizes this will not assume that his neighbor is always wrong, and he\\r\\nwill come to have that wide, conscientious tolerance, which is not\\r\\nindifference, but which is at the farthest remove from the zeal of mere\\r\\nbigotry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\r\\n\\r\\nWHY WE SHOULD STUDY THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\n83. THE PROMINENCE GIVEN TO THE SUBJECT.--When one reflects upon the\\r\\nnumber of lecture courses given every year at our universities and\\r\\ncolleges on the history of philosophy, one is struck by the fact that\\r\\nphilosophy is not treated as are most other subjects with which the\\r\\nstudent is brought into contact.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we study mathematics, or chemistry, or physics, or physiology, or\\r\\nbiology, the effort is made to lay before us in a convenient form the\\r\\nlatest results which have been attained in those sciences.  Of their\\r\\nhistory very little is said; and, indeed, as we have seen (section 6),\\r\\nlectures on the history of the inductive sciences are apt to be\\r\\nregarded as philosophical in their character and aims rather than as\\r\\nmerely scientific.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interest in the history of philosophy is certainly not a\\r\\ndiminishing one.  Text-books covering the whole field or a part of it\\r\\nare multiplied; extensive studies are made and published covering the\\r\\nwork of individual philosophers; innumerable historical discussions\\r\\nmake their appearance in the pages of current philosophical journals.\\r\\nNo student is regarded as fairly acquainted with philosophy who knows\\r\\nnothing of Plato and Aristotle, Descartes and Spinoza, Berkeley and\\r\\nHume, Kant and Hegel, and the rest.  We should look upon him as having\\r\\na very restricted outlook if he had read only the works of the thinkers\\r\\nof our own day; indeed, we should not expect him to have a proper\\r\\ncomprehension even of these, for their chapters must remain blind and\\r\\nmeaningless to one who has no knowledge of what preceded them and has\\r\\ngiven birth to the doctrines there set forth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a fair question to ask: Why is philosophy so bound up with the\\r\\nstudy of the past?  Why may we not content ourselves with what has up\\r\\nto the present been attained, and omit a survey of the road along which\\r\\nour predecessors have traveled?\\r\\n\\r\\n84. THE ESPECIAL IMPORTANCE OF HISTORICAL STUDIES TO REFLECTIVE\\r\\nTHOUGHT.--In some of the preceding chapters dealing with the various\\r\\nphilosophical sciences, it has been indicated that, in the sciences we\\r\\ndo not regard as philosophical, men may work on the basis of certain\\r\\ncommonly accepted assumptions and employ methods which are generally\\r\\nregarded as trustworthy within the given field.  The value both of the\\r\\nfundamental assumptions and of the methods of investigation appear to\\r\\nbe guaranteed by the results attained.  There are not merely\\r\\nobservation and hypothesis; there is also verification, and where this\\r\\nis lacking, men either abandon their position or reserve their judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, a certain body of interrelated facts is built up, the\\r\\nsignificance of which, in many fields at least, is apparent even to the\\r\\nlayman.  Nor is it wholly beyond him to judge whether the results of\\r\\nscientific investigations can be verified.  An eclipse, calculated by\\r\\nmethods which he is quite unable to follow, may occur at the appointed\\r\\nhour and confirm his respect for the astronomer.  The efficacy of a\\r\\nserum in the cure of diseases may convince him that work done in the\\r\\nlaboratory is not labor lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems evident that the several sciences do really rise on stepping\\r\\nstones of their dead selves, and that those selves of the past are\\r\\nreally dead and superseded.  Who would now think of going back for his\\r\\nscience to Plato\\'s \"Timaeus,\" or would accept the description of the\\r\\nphysical world contained in the works of Aristotle?  What chemist or\\r\\nphysicist need busy himself with the doctrine of atoms and their\\r\\nclashings presented in the magnificent poem of Lucretius?  Who can\\r\\nforbear a smile--a sympathetic one--when he turns over the pages of\\r\\nAugustine\\'s \"City of God,\" and sees what sort of a world this\\r\\nremarkable man believed himself to inhabit?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the historic and human interest that carries us back to these\\r\\nthings.  We say: What ingenuity! what a happy guess! how well that was\\r\\nreasoned in the light of what was actually known about the world in\\r\\nthose days!  But we never forget that what compels our admiration does\\r\\nso because it makes us realize that we stand in the presence of a great\\r\\nmind, and not because it is a foundation-stone in the great edifice\\r\\nwhich science has erected.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is not so in philosophy.  It is not possible to regard the\\r\\nphilosophical reflections of Plato and of Aristotle as superseded in\\r\\nthe same sense in which we may so regard their science.  The reason for\\r\\nthis lies in the difference between scientific thought and reflective\\r\\nthought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two have been contrasted in Chapter II of this volume.  It was\\r\\nthere pointed out that the sort of thinking demanded in the special\\r\\nsciences is not so very different from that with which we are all\\r\\nfamiliar in common life.  Science is more accurate and systematic, it\\r\\nhas a broader outlook, and it is free from the imperfections which\\r\\nvitiate the uncritical and fragmentary knowledge which experience of\\r\\nthe world yields the unscientific.  But, after all, the world is much\\r\\nthe same sort of a world to the man of science and to his uncritical\\r\\nneighbor.  The latter can, as we have seen, understand what, in\\r\\ngeneral, the former is doing, and can appropriate many of his results.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, it often happens that the man who has not, with\\r\\npains and labor, learned to reflect, cannot even see that the\\r\\nphilosopher has a genuine problem before him.  Thus, the plain man\\r\\naccepts the fact that he has a mind and that it knows the world.  That\\r\\nboth mental phenomena and physical phenomena should be carefully\\r\\nobserved and classified he may be ready to admit.  But that the very\\r\\nconceptions of mind and of what it means to know a world are vague and\\r\\nindefinite in the extreme, and stand in need of careful analysis, he\\r\\ndoes not realize.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, he sees that our knowledge needs to be extended and\\r\\nrendered more accurate and reliable, but he does not see that, if we\\r\\nare to think clearly and consciously, all our knowledge needs to be\\r\\ngone over in a different way.  In common life it is quite possible to\\r\\nuse in the attainment of practical ends knowledge which has not been\\r\\nanalyzed and of the full meaning of which we are ignorant.  I hope it\\r\\nhas become evident in the course of this volume that something closely\\r\\nanalogous is true in the field of science.  The man of science may\\r\\nmeasure space and time, and may study the phenomena of the human mind,\\r\\nwithout even attempting to answer all the questions which may be raised\\r\\nas to what is meant, in the last analysis, by such concepts as space,\\r\\ntime, and the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat such concepts should be analyzed has, I hope, been made clear, if\\r\\nonly that erroneous and misleading notions as to these things should be\\r\\navoided.  But when a man with a genius for metaphysical analysis\\r\\naddresses himself to this task, he cannot simply hand the results\\r\\nattained by his reflections over to his less reflective fellow-man.\\r\\nHis words are not understood; he seems to be dealing with shadows, with\\r\\nunrealities; he has passed from the real world of common thought into\\r\\nanother world which appears to have little relation to the former.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor can verification, indubitable proof, be demanded and furnished as\\r\\nit can in many parts of the field cultivated by the special sciences.\\r\\nWe may judge science fairly well without ourselves being scientists,\\r\\nbut it is not possible to judge philosophy without being to some extent\\r\\na philosopher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, the conclusions of reflective thought must be judged by\\r\\nfollowing the process and discovering its cogency or the reverse.\\r\\nThus, when the philosopher lays before us an argument to prove that we\\r\\nmust regard the only ultimate reality in the world as unknowable, and\\r\\nmust abandon our theistic convictions, how shall we make a decision as\\r\\nto whether he is right or is wrong?  May we expect that the day will\\r\\ncome when he will be justified or condemned as is the astronomer on the\\r\\nday predicted for an eclipse?  Neither the philosophy of Locke, nor\\r\\nthat of Descartes, nor that of Kant, can be vindicated as can a\\r\\nprediction touching an eclipse of the sun.  To judge these men, we must\\r\\nlearn to think with them, to survey the road by which they travel; and\\r\\nthis we cannot do until we have learned the art.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether we like to admit it or not, we must admit, if we are\\r\\nfair-minded and intelligent, that philosophy cannot speak with the same\\r\\nauthority as science, where science has been able to verify its\\r\\nresults.  There are, of course, scientific hypotheses and speculations\\r\\nwhich should be regarded as being quite as uncertain as anything\\r\\nbrought forward by the philosophers.  But, admitting this, the fact\\r\\nremains that there is a difference between the two fields as a whole,\\r\\nand that the philosopher should learn not to speak with an assumption\\r\\nof authority.  No final philosophy has been attained, so palpably firm\\r\\nin its foundation, and so admittedly trustworthy in its construction,\\r\\nthat we are justified in saying: Now we need never go back to the past\\r\\nunless to gratify the historic interest.  It is a weakness of young\\r\\nmen, and of older men of partisan temper, to feel very sure of matters\\r\\nwhich, in the nature of things, must remain uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince these things are so, and since men possess the power of\\r\\nreflection in very varying degree, it is not surprising that we find it\\r\\nworth while to turn back and study the thoughts of those who have had a\\r\\ngenius for reflection, even though they lived at a time when modern\\r\\nscience was awaiting its birth.  Some things cannot be known until\\r\\nother things are known; often there must be a vast collection of\\r\\nindividual facts before the generalizations of science can come into\\r\\nbeing.  But many of the problems with which reflective thought is still\\r\\nstruggling have not been furthered in the least by information which\\r\\nhas been collected during the centuries which have elapsed since they\\r\\nwere attacked by the early Greek philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we are still discussing the distinction between \"appearance\" and\\r\\n\"reality,\" and many and varied are the opinions at which philosophers\\r\\narrive.  But Thales, who heads the list of the Greek philosophers, had\\r\\nquite enough material, given in his own experience, to enable him to\\r\\nsolve this problem as well as any modern philosopher, had he been able\\r\\nto use the material.  He who is familiar with the history of philosophy\\r\\nwill recognize that, although one may smile at Augustine\\'s accounts of\\r\\nthe races of men, and of the spontaneous generation of small animals,\\r\\nno one has a right to despise his profound reflections upon the nature\\r\\nof time and the problems which arise out of its character as past,\\r\\npresent, and future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is that metaphysics does not lag behind because of our lack of\\r\\nmaterial to work with.  The difficulties we have to face are nothing\\r\\nelse than the difficulties of reflective thought.  Why can we not tell\\r\\nclearly what we mean when we use the word \"self,\" or speak of\\r\\n\"knowledge,\" or insist that we know an \"external world\"?  Are we not\\r\\nconcerned with the most familiar of experiences?  To be sure we\\r\\nare--with experiences familiarly, but vaguely and unanalytically, known\\r\\nand, hence, only half known.  All these experiences the great men of\\r\\nthe past had as well as we; and if they had greater powers of\\r\\nreflection, perhaps they saw more deeply into them than we do.  At any\\r\\nrate, we cannot afford to assume that they did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing, however, I must not omit to mention.  Although one man\\r\\ncannot turn over bodily the results of his reflection to another, it by\\r\\nno means follows that he cannot give the other a helping hand, or warn\\r\\nhim of dangers by himself stumbling into pitfalls, as the case may be.\\r\\nWe have an indefinite advantage over the solitary thinkers who opened\\r\\nup the paths of reflection, for we have the benefit of their teaching.\\r\\nAnd this brings me to a consideration which I must discuss in the next\\r\\nsection.\\r\\n\\r\\n85. THE VALUE OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW.--The man who has not read is\\r\\nlike the man who has not traveled--he is not an intelligent critic, for\\r\\nhe has nothing with which to compare what falls within the little\\r\\ncircle of his experiences.  That the prevailing architecture of a town\\r\\nis ugly can scarcely impress one who is acquainted with no other town.\\r\\nIf we live in a community in which men\\'s manners are not good, and\\r\\ntheir standard of living not the highest, our attention does not dwell\\r\\nmuch upon the fact, unless some contrasted experience wakes within us a\\r\\nclear consciousness of the difference.  That to which we are accustomed\\r\\nwe accept uncritically and unreflectively.  It is difficult for us to\\r\\nsee it somewhat as one might see it to whom it came as a new experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, there may be in the one town buildings of more and of less\\r\\narchitectural beauty; and there may be in the one community differences\\r\\nof opinion that furnish intellectual stimulus and keep awake the\\r\\ncritical spirit.  Still, there is such a thing as a prevalent type of\\r\\narchitecture, and there is such a thing as the spirit of the times.  He\\r\\nwho is carried along by the spirit of the age may easily conclude that\\r\\nwhat is, is right, because he hears few raise their voices in protest.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo estimate justly the type of thought in which he has been brought up,\\r\\nhe must have something with which to compare it.  He must stand at a\\r\\ndistance, and try to judge it as he would judge a type of doctrine\\r\\npresented to him for the first rime.  And in the accomplishment of this\\r\\ntask he can find no greater aid than the study of the history of\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is at first something of a shock to a man to discover that\\r\\nassumptions which he has been accustomed to make without question have\\r\\nbeen frankly repudiated by men quite as clever as he, and, perhaps,\\r\\nmore critical.  It opens the eyes to see that his standards of worth\\r\\nhave been weighed by others and have been found wanting.  It may well\\r\\nincline him to reexamine reasonings in which he has detected no flaw,\\r\\nwhen he finds that acute minds have tried them before, and have\\r\\ndeclared them faulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor can it be without its influence upon his judgment of the\\r\\nsignificance of a doctrine, when it becomes plain to him that this\\r\\nsignificance can scarcely be fully comprehended until the history of\\r\\nthe doctrine is known.  For example, he thinks of the mind as somehow\\r\\nin the body, as interacting with it, as a substance, and as immaterial.\\r\\nIn the course of his reading it begins to dawn upon his consciousness\\r\\nthat he has not thought all this out for himself; he has taken these\\r\\nnotions from others, who in turn have had them from their predecessors.\\r\\nHe begins to realize that he is not resting upon evidence independently\\r\\nfound in his own experience, but has upon his hands a sheaf of opinions\\r\\nwhich are the echoes of old philosophies, and whose rise and\\r\\ndevelopment can be traced over the stretch of the centuries.  Can he\\r\\nhelp asking himself, when he sees this, whether the opinions in\\r\\nquestion express the truth and the whole truth?  Is he not forced to\\r\\ntake the critical attitude toward them?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he views the succession of systems which pass in review before\\r\\nhim, noting how a truth may be dimly seen by one writer, denied by\\r\\nanother, taken up again and made clearer by a third, and so on, how can\\r\\nhe avoid the reflection that, as there was some error mixed with the\\r\\ntruth presented in earlier systems, so there probably is some error in\\r\\nwhatever may happen to be the form of doctrine generally received in\\r\\nhis own time?  The evolution of humanity is not yet at an end; men\\r\\nstill struggle to see clearly, and fall short of the ideal; it must be\\r\\na good thing to be freed from the dogmatic assumption of finality\\r\\nnatural to the man of limited outlook.  In studying the history of\\r\\nphilosophy sympathetically we are not merely calling to our aid critics\\r\\nwho possess the advantage of seeing things from a different point of\\r\\nview, but we are reminding ourselves that we, too, are human and\\r\\nfallible.\\r\\n\\r\\n86. PHILOSOPHY AS POETRY, AND PHILOSOPHY AS SCIENCE.--The recognition\\r\\nof the truth that the problems of reflection do not admit of easy\\r\\nsolution and that verification can scarcely be expected as it can in\\r\\nthe fields of the special sciences, need not, even when it is brought\\r\\nhome to us, as it is apt to be, by the study of the history of\\r\\nphilosophy, lead us to believe that philosophies are like the fashions,\\r\\na something gotten up to suit the taste of the day, and to be dismissed\\r\\nwithout regret as soon as that taste changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy is sometimes compared with poetry.  It is argued that each\\r\\nage must have its own poetry, even though it be inferior to that which\\r\\nit has inherited from the past.  Just so, it is said, each age must\\r\\nhave its own philosophy, and the philosophy of an earlier age will not\\r\\nsatisfy its demands.  The implication is that in dealing with\\r\\nphilosophy we are not concerned with what is true or untrue in itself\\r\\nconsidered, but with what is satisfying to us or the reverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it would sound absurd to say that each age must have its own\\r\\ngeometry or its own physics.  The fact that it has long been known that\\r\\nthe sum of the interior angles of a plane triangle is equal to two\\r\\nright angles, does not warrant me in repudiating that truth; nor am I\\r\\njustified in doing so, and in believing the opposite, merely because I\\r\\nfind the statement uninteresting or distasteful.  When we are dealing\\r\\nwith such matters as these, we recognize that truth is truth, and that,\\r\\nif we mistake it or refuse to recognize it, so much the worse for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it otherwise in philosophy?  Is it a perfectly proper thing that, in\\r\\none age, men should be idealists, and in another, materialists; in one,\\r\\ntheists, and in another, agnostics?  Is the distinction between true\\r\\nand false nothing else than the distinction between what is in harmony\\r\\nwith the spirit of the times and what is not?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it is natural that there should be such fluctuations of opinion,\\r\\nwe may freely admit.  Many things influence a man to embrace a given\\r\\ntype of doctrine, and, as we have seen, verification is a difficult\\r\\nproblem.  But have we here, any more than in other fields, the right to\\r\\nassume that a doctrine was true at a given time merely because it\\r\\n_seemed_ to men true at that time, or because they found it pleasing?\\r\\nThe history of science reveals that many things have long been believed\\r\\nto be true, and, indeed, to be bound up with what were regarded as the\\r\\nhighest interests of man, and that these same things have later been\\r\\ndiscovered to be false--not false merely for a later age, but false for\\r\\nall time; as false when they were believed in as when they were\\r\\nexploded and known to be exploded.  No man of sense believes that the\\r\\nPtolemaic system was true for a while, and that then the Copernican\\r\\nbecame true.  We say that the former only _seemed_ true, and that the\\r\\nenthusiasm of its adherents was a mistaken enthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to remember that philosophies are brought forward because it\\r\\nis believed or hoped that they are true.  A fairy tale may be recited\\r\\nand may be approved, although no one dreams of attaching faith to the\\r\\nevents narrated in it.  But a philosophy attempts to give us some\\r\\naccount of the nature of the world in which we live.  If the\\r\\nphilosopher frankly abandons the attempt to tell us what is true, and\\r\\nwith a Celtic generosity addresses himself to the task of saying what\\r\\nwill be agreeable to us, he loses his right to the title.  It is not\\r\\nenough that he stirs our emotions, and works up his unrealities into\\r\\nsomething resembling a poem.  It is not primarily his task to please,\\r\\nas it is not the task of the serious worker in science to please those\\r\\nwhom he is called upon to instruct.  Truth is truth, whether it be\\r\\nscientific truth or philosophical truth.  And error, no matter how\\r\\nagreeable or how nicely adjusted to the temper of the times, is always\\r\\nerror.  If it is error in a field in which the detection and exposure\\r\\nof error is difficult, it is the more dangerous, and the more should we\\r\\nbe on our guard against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may, then, accept the lesson of the history of philosophy, to wit,\\r\\nthat we have no right to regard any given doctrine as final in such a\\r\\nsense that it need no longer be held tentatively and as subject to\\r\\npossible revision; but we need not, on that account, deny that\\r\\nphilosophy is, what it has in the past been believed to be, an earnest\\r\\nsearch for truth.  A philosophy that did not even profess to be this\\r\\nwould not be listened to at all.  It would be regarded as too trivial\\r\\nto merit serious attention.  If we take the word \"science\" in the broad\\r\\nsense to indicate a knowledge of the truth more exact and satisfactory\\r\\nthan that which obtains in common life, we may say that every\\r\\nphilosophy worthy of the name is, at least, an attempt at scientific\\r\\nknowledge.  Of course, this sense of the word \"science\" should not be\\r\\nconfused with that in which it has been used elsewhere in this volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n87. HOW TO READ THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY.--He who takes up the history\\r\\nof philosophy for the first time is apt to be impressed with the fact\\r\\nthat he is reading something that might not inaptly be called the\\r\\nhistory of human error.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt begins with crude and, to the superficial spectator, seemingly\\r\\nchildish attempts in the field of physical science.  There are clever\\r\\nguesses at the nature of the physical world, but the boldest of\\r\\nspeculations are entered upon with no apparent recognition of the\\r\\ndifficulty of the task undertaken, and with no realization of the need\\r\\nfor caution.  Somewhat later a different class of problems makes its\\r\\nappearance--the problems which have to do with the mind and with the\\r\\nnature of knowledge, reflective problems which scarcely seem to have\\r\\ncome fairly within the horizon of the earliest thinkers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese problems even the beginner may be willing to recognize as\\r\\nphilosophical; but he may conscientiously harbor a doubt as to the\\r\\ndesirability of spending time upon the solutions which are offered.\\r\\nSystem rises after system, and confronts him with what appear to be new\\r\\nquestions and new answers.  It seems as though each philosopher were\\r\\nconstructing a world for himself independently, and commanding him to\\r\\naccept it, without first convincing him of his right to assume this\\r\\ntone of authority and to set up for an oracle.  In all this conflict of\\r\\nopinions where shall we seek for truth?  Why should we accept one man\\r\\nas a teacher rather than another?  Is not the lesson to be gathered\\r\\nfrom the whole procession of systems best summed up in the dictum of\\r\\nProtagoras: \"Man is the measure of all things\"--each has his own truth,\\r\\nand this need not be truth to another?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, I say, is a first impression and a natural one.  I hasten to add:\\r\\nthis should not be the last impression of those who read with\\r\\nthoughtful attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing should be emphasized at the outset: nothing will so often\\r\\nbear rereading as the history of philosophy.  When we go over the\\r\\nground after we have obtained a first acquaintance with the teachings\\r\\nof the different philosophers, we begin to realize that what we have in\\r\\nour hands is, in a sense, a connected whole.  We see that if Plato and\\r\\nAristotle had not lived, we could not have had the philosophy which\\r\\npassed current in the Middle Ages and furnished a foundation for the\\r\\nteachings of the Church.  We realize that without this latter we could\\r\\nnot have had Descartes, and without Descartes we could not have had\\r\\nLocke and Berkeley and Hume.  And had not these lived, we should not\\r\\nhave had Kant and his successors.  Other philosophies we should\\r\\nundoubtedly have had, for the busy mind of man must produce something.\\r\\nBut whatever glimpses at the truth these men have vouchsafed us have\\r\\nbeen guaranteed by the order of development in which they have stood.\\r\\nThey could not independently have written the books that have come down\\r\\nto us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis should be evident from what has been said earlier in this chapter\\r\\nand elsewhere in this book.  Let us bear in mind that a philosopher\\r\\ndraws his material from two sources.  First of all, he has the\\r\\nexperience of the mind and the world which is the common property of us\\r\\nall.  But it is, as we have seen, by no means easy to use this\\r\\nmaterial.  It is vastly difficult to reflect.  It is fatally easy to\\r\\nmisconceive what presents itself in our experience.  With the most\\r\\nearnest effort to describe what lies before us, we give a false\\r\\ndescription, and we mislead ourselves and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second place, the philosopher has the interpretations of\\r\\nexperience which he has inherited from his predecessors.  The influence\\r\\nof these is enormous.  Each age has, to a large extent, its problems\\r\\nalready formulated or half formulated for it.  Every man must have\\r\\nancestors, of some sort, if he is to appear upon this earthly stage at\\r\\nall; and a wholly independent philosopher is as impossible a creature\\r\\nas an ancestorless man.  We have seen how Descartes (section 60) tried\\r\\nto repudiate his debt to the past, and how little successful he was in\\r\\ndoing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we make a mistake if we overlook the genius of the individual\\r\\nthinker.  The history of speculative thought has many times taken a\\r\\nturn which can only be accounted for by taking into consideration the\\r\\ngenius for reflective thought possessed by some great mind.  In the\\r\\ncrucible of such an intellect, old truths take on a new aspect,\\r\\nfamiliar facts acquire a new and a richer meaning.  But we also make a\\r\\nmistake if we fail to see in the writings of such a man one of the\\r\\nstages which has been reached in the gradual evolution of human\\r\\nthought, if we fail to realize that each philosophy is to a great\\r\\nextent the product of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one comes to understand these things, the history of philosophy no\\r\\nlonger presents itself as a mere agglomeration of arbitrary and\\r\\nindependent systems.  And an attentive reading gives us a further key\\r\\nto the interpretation of what seemed inexplicable.  We find that there\\r\\nmay be distinct and different streams of thought, which, for a while,\\r\\nrun parallel without commingling their waters.  For centuries the\\r\\nEpicurean followed his own tradition, and walked in the footsteps of\\r\\nhis own master.  The Stoic was of sterner stuff, and he chose to travel\\r\\nanother path.  To this day there are adherents of the old church\\r\\nphilosophy, Neo-Scholastics, whose ways of thinking can only be\\r\\nunderstood when we have some knowledge of Aristotle and of his\\r\\ninfluence upon men during the Middle Ages.  We ourselves may be\\r\\nKantians or Hegelians, and the man at our elbow may recognize as his\\r\\nspiritual father Comte or Spencer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not follow that, because one system follows another in\\r\\nchronological order, it is its lineal descendant.  But some ancestor a\\r\\nsystem always has, and if we have the requisite learning and ingenuity,\\r\\nwe need not find it impossible to explain why this thinker or that was\\r\\ninfluenced to give his thought the peculiar turn that characterizes it.\\r\\nSometimes many influences have conspired to attain the result, and it\\r\\nis no small pleasure to address oneself to the task of disentangling\\r\\nthe threads which enter into the fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, as we read thus with discrimination, we begin to see that the\\r\\ngreat men of the past have not spoken without appearing to have\\r\\nsufficient reason for their utterances in the light of the times in\\r\\nwhich they lived.  We may make it a rule that, when they seem to be\\r\\nspeaking arbitrarily, to be laying before us reasonings that are not\\r\\nreasonings, dogmas for which no excuse seems to be offered, the fault\\r\\nlies in our lack of comprehension.  Until we can understand how a man,\\r\\nliving in a certain century, and breathing a certain moral and\\r\\nintellectual atmosphere, could have said what he did, we should assume\\r\\nthat we have read his words, but not his real thought.  For the latter\\r\\nthere is always a psychological, if not a logical, justification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd this brings me to the question of the language in which the\\r\\nphilosophers have expressed their thoughts.  The more attentively one\\r\\nreads the history of philosophy, the clearer it becomes that the number\\r\\nof problems with which the philosophers have occupied themselves is not\\r\\noverwhelmingly great.  If each philosophy which confronts us seems to\\r\\nus quite new and strange, it is because we have not arrived at the\\r\\nstage at which it is possible for us to recognize old friends with new\\r\\nfaces.  The same old problems, the problems which must ever present\\r\\nthemselves to reflective thought, recur again and again.  The form is\\r\\nmore or less changed, and the answers which are given to them are not,\\r\\nof course, always the same.  Each age expresses itself in a somewhat\\r\\ndifferent way.  But sometimes the solution proposed for a given problem\\r\\nis almost the same in substance, even when the two thinkers we are\\r\\ncontrasting belong to centuries which lie far apart.  In this case,\\r\\nonly our own inability to strip off the husk and reach the fruit itself\\r\\nprevents us from seeing that we have before us nothing really new.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, if we read the history of philosophy with patience and with\\r\\ndiscrimination, it grows luminous.  We come to feel nearer to the men\\r\\nof the past.  We see that we may learn from their successes and from\\r\\ntheir failures; and if we are capable of drawing a moral at all, we\\r\\napply the lesson to ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\r\\n\\r\\nSOME PRACTICAL ADMONITIONS\\r\\n\\r\\n88. BE PREPARED TO ENTER UPON A NEW WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS.--We have\\r\\nseen that reflective thought tries to analyze experience and to attain\\r\\nto a clear view of the elements that make it up--to realize vividly\\r\\nwhat is the very texture of the known world, and what is the nature of\\r\\nknowledge.  It is possible to live to old age, as many do, without even\\r\\na suspicion that there may be such a knowledge as this, and\\r\\nnevertheless to possess a large measure of rather vague but very\\r\\nserviceable information about both minds and bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is something of a shock to learn that a multitude of questions may\\r\\nbe asked touching the most familiar things in our experience, and that\\r\\nour comprehension of those things may be so vague that we grope in vain\\r\\nfor an answer.  Space, time, matter, minds, realities,--with these\\r\\nthings we have to do every day.  Can it be that we do not know what\\r\\nthey are?  Then we must be blind, indeed.  How shall we set about\\r\\nenlightening our ignorance?\\r\\n\\r\\nNot as we have enlightened our ignorance heretofore.  We have added\\r\\nfact to fact; but our task now is to gain a new light on all facts, to\\r\\nsee them from a different point of view; not so much to extend our\\r\\nknowledge as to deepen it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems scarcely necessary to point out that our world, when looked at\\r\\nfor the first time in this new way, may seem to be a new and strange\\r\\nworld.  The real things of our experience may appear to melt away, to\\r\\nbe dissolved by reflection into mere shadows and unrealities.  Well do\\r\\nI remember the consternation with which, when almost a schoolboy, I\\r\\nfirst made my acquaintance with John Stuart Mill\\'s doctrine that the\\r\\nthings about us are \"permanent possibilities of sensation.\"  To Mill,\\r\\nof course, chairs and tables were still chairs and tables, but to me\\r\\nthey became ghosts, inhabitants of a phantom world, to find oneself in\\r\\nwhich was a matter of the gravest concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that this sense of the unreality of things comes often to\\r\\nthose who have entered upon the path of reflection, It may be a comfort\\r\\nto such to realize that it is rather a thing to be expected.  How can\\r\\none feel at home in a world which one has entered for the first time?\\r\\nOne cannot become a philosopher and remain exactly the man that one was\\r\\nbefore.  Men have tried to do it,--Thomas Reid is a notable instance\\r\\n(section 50); but the result is that one simply does not become a\\r\\nphilosopher.  It is not possible to gain a new and a deeper insight\\r\\ninto the nature of things, and yet to see things just as one saw them\\r\\nbefore one attained to this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, we are willing to study philosophy at all, we must be willing\\r\\nto embrace new views of the world, if there seem to be good reasons for\\r\\nso doing.  And if at first we suffer from a sense of bewilderment, we\\r\\nmust have patience, and must wait to see whether time and practice may\\r\\nnot do something toward removing our distress.  It may be that we have\\r\\nonly half understood what has been revealed to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n89. BE WILLING TO CONSIDER POSSIBILITIES WHICH AT FIRST STRIKE ONE AS\\r\\nABSURD.--It must be confessed that the philosophers have sometimes\\r\\nbrought forward doctrines which seem repellent to good sense, and\\r\\nlittle in harmony with the experience of the world which we have all\\r\\nour lives enjoyed.  Shall we on this account turn our backs upon them\\r\\nand refuse them an impartial hearing?\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, the idealist maintains that there is no existence save psychical\\r\\nexistence; that the material things about us are really mental things.\\r\\nOne of the forms taken by this doctrine is that alluded to above, that\\r\\nthings are permanent possibilities of sensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it can hardly be denied that this sounds out of harmony with\\r\\nthe common opinion of mankind.  Men do not hesitate to distinguish\\r\\nbetween minds and material things, nor do they believe that material\\r\\nthings exist only in minds.  That dreams and hallucinations exist only\\r\\nin minds they are very willing to admit; but they will not admit that\\r\\nthis is true of such things as real chairs and tables.  And if we ask\\r\\nthem why they take such a position, they fall back upon what seems\\r\\ngiven in experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the reader of the earlier chapters has seen, I think that the\\r\\nplain man is more nearly right in his opinion touching the existence of\\r\\na world of non-mental things than is the idealistic philosopher.  The\\r\\nlatter has seen a truth and misconceived it, thus losing some truth\\r\\nthat he had before he began to reflect.  The former has not seen the\\r\\ntruth which has impressed the idealist, and he has held on to that\\r\\nvague recognition that there are two orders of things given in our\\r\\nexperience, the physical and the mental, which seems to us so\\r\\nunmistakable a fact until we fall into the hands of the philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all this does not prove that we have a right simply to fall back\\r\\nupon \"common sense,\" and refuse to listen to the idealist.  The\\r\\ndeliverances of unreflective common sense are vague in the extreme; and\\r\\nthough it may seem to assure us that there is a world of things\\r\\nnon-mental, its account of that world is confused and incoherent.  He\\r\\nwho must depend on common sense alone can find no answer to the\\r\\nidealists; he refuses to follow them, but he cannot refute them.  He is\\r\\nreduced to dogmatic denial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is in itself an uncomfortable position.  And when we add to this\\r\\nthe reflection that such a man loses the truth which the idealist\\r\\nemphasizes, the truth that the external world of which we speak must\\r\\nbe, if we are to know it at all, a world revealed to our senses, a\\r\\nworld given in our experience, we see that he who stops his ears\\r\\nremains in ignorance.  The fact is that the man who has never weighed\\r\\nthe evidence that impresses the idealist is not able to see clearly\\r\\nwhat is meant by that external world in which we all incline to put\\r\\nsuch faith.  We may say that he _feels_ a truth blindly, but does not\\r\\nsee it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us take another illustration.  If there is one thing that we feel\\r\\nto be as sure as the existence of the external world, it is that there\\r\\nare other minds more or less resembling our own.  The solipsist may try\\r\\nto persuade us that the evidence for such minds is untrustworthy.  We\\r\\nmay see no flaw in his argument, but he cannot convince us.  May we\\r\\nignore him, and refuse to consider the matter at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely not, if we wish to substitute clear thinking for vague and\\r\\nindefinite opinion.  We should listen with attention, strive to\\r\\nunderstand all the reasonings laid before us, and then, if they seem to\\r\\nlead to conclusions really not in harmony with our experience, go\\r\\ncarefully over the ground and try to discover the flaw in them.  It is\\r\\nonly by doing something like this that we can come to see clearly what\\r\\nis meant when we speak of two or more minds and the relation between\\r\\nthem.  The solipsist can help us, and we should let him do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should, therefore, be willing to consider seriously all sorts of\\r\\ndoctrines which may at first strike us as unreasonable.  I have chosen\\r\\ntwo which I believe to contain error.  But the man who approaches a\\r\\ndoctrine which impresses him as strange has no right to assume at the\\r\\noutset that it contains error.  We have seen again and again how easy\\r\\nit is to misapprehend what is given in experience.  The philosopher may\\r\\nbe in the right, and what he says may repel us because we have become\\r\\naccustomed to certain erroneous notions, and they have come to seem\\r\\nself-evident truths.\\r\\n\\r\\n90. DO NOT HAVE TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY.--But if it is an error\\r\\nto refuse to listen to the philosopher, it is surely no less an error\\r\\nto accord him an authority above what he has a right to demand.  Bear\\r\\nin mind what was said in the last chapter about the difference between\\r\\nthe special sciences and philosophy.  There is in the latter field no\\r\\nbody of doctrine that we may justly regard as authoritative.  There are\\r\\n\"schools\" of philosophy, and their adherents fall into the very human\\r\\nerror of feeling very sure that they and those who agree with them are\\r\\nright; and the emphasis with which they speak is apt to mislead those\\r\\nwho are not well informed.  I shall say a few words about the dangers\\r\\nof the \"school.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we look about us, we are impressed by the fact that there are\\r\\n\"schools\" of philosophy, somewhat as there are religious sects and\\r\\npolitical parties.  An impressive teacher sets the mark of his\\r\\npersonality and of his preferences upon those who come under his\\r\\ninfluence.  They are not at an age to be very critical, and, indeed,\\r\\nthey have not as yet the requisite learning to enable them to be\\r\\ncritical.  They keep the trend which has been given them early in life,\\r\\nand, when they become teachers, they pass on the type of thought with\\r\\nwhich they have been inoculated, and the circle widens.  \"Schools\" may\\r\\narise, of course, in a different way.  An epoch-making book may sweep\\r\\nmen off of their feet and make of them passionate adherents.  But he\\r\\nwho has watched the development of the American universities during the\\r\\nlast twenty-five years must be impressed with the enormous influence\\r\\nwhich certain teachers have had in giving a direction to the\\r\\nphilosophic thought of those who have come in contact with them.  We\\r\\nexpect the pupils of a given master to have a given shade of opinion,\\r\\nand very often we are not disappointed in our guess.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is entirely natural that this should be so.  Those who betake\\r\\nthemselves to the study of philosophy are men like other men.  They\\r\\nhave the same feelings, and the bending of the twig has the same\\r\\nsignificance in their case that it has in that of others.  It is no\\r\\nsmall compliment to a teacher that he can thus spread his influence,\\r\\nand leave his proxies even when he passes away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, when we strive to \"put off humanity\" and to look at the whole\\r\\nmatter under the cold light of reason, we may well ask ourselves,\\r\\nwhether he who unconsciously accepts his philosophy, in whole or in\\r\\npart, because it has been the philosophy of his teacher, is not doing\\r\\nwhat is done by those persons whose politics and whose religion take\\r\\ntheir color from such accidental circumstances as birth in a given\\r\\nclass or family traditions?\\r\\n\\r\\nI am far from saying that it is, in general, a bad thing for the world\\r\\nthat men should be influenced in this way by one another.  I say only\\r\\nthat, when we look at the facts of the case, we must admit that even\\r\\nour teachers of philosophy do not always become representatives of the\\r\\npeculiar type of thought for which they stand, merely through a\\r\\ndeliberate choice from the wealth of material which the history of\\r\\nspeculative thought lays before them.  They are influenced by others to\\r\\ntake what they do take, and the traces of this influence are apt to\\r\\nremain with them through life.  He who wishes to be entirely impartial\\r\\nmust be on his guard against such influences as these, and must\\r\\ndistrust prejudices for or against certain doctrines, when he finds\\r\\nthat he imbibed them at an uncritical age and has remained under their\\r\\ninfluence ever since.  Some do appear to be able to emancipate\\r\\nthemselves, and to outgrow what they first learned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, as I have said, natural that there should be a tendency to form\\r\\n\"schools\" in philosophy.  And there are certain things that make this\\r\\nsomewhat uncritical acceptance of a doctrine very attractive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, if we are willing to take a system of any sort as a\\r\\nwhole, it saves us a vast amount of trouble.  We seem to have a\\r\\ncitadel, a point of vantage from which we can look out upon life and\\r\\ninterpret it.  If the house we live in is not in all respects ideal, at\\r\\nleast it is a house, and we are not homeless.  There is nothing more\\r\\nintolerable to most men than the having of no opinions.  They will\\r\\nchange one opinion for another, but they will rarely consent to do\\r\\nwithout altogether.  It is something to have an answer to offer to\\r\\nthose who persist in asking questions; and it is something to have some\\r\\nsort of ground under one\\'s feet, even if it be not very solid ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  Man is a social creature, and he is greatly fortified in his\\r\\nopinions by the consciousness that others share them with him.  If we\\r\\nbecome adherents of a \"school,\" we have the agreeable consciousness\\r\\nthat we are not walking alone through the maze of speculations that\\r\\nconfronts those who reflect.  There appears to be a traveled way in\\r\\nwhich we may have some confidence.  Are we not following the crowd, or,\\r\\nat least, a goodly number of the pilgrims who are seeking the same goal\\r\\nwith ourselves?  Under such circumstances we are not so often impelled\\r\\nto inquire anxiously whether we are after all upon the right road.  We\\r\\nassume that we have made no mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder such circumstances we are apt to forget that there are many such\\r\\nroads, and that these have been traveled in ages past by troops very\\r\\nmuch like our own, who also cherished the hope that they were upon the\\r\\none and only highway.  In other words, we are apt to forget the lesson\\r\\nof the history of philosophy.  This is a serious mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what intensifies our danger, if we belong to a school which happens\\r\\nto be dominant and to have active representatives, is that we get very\\r\\nlittle real criticism.  The books that we write are usually criticised\\r\\nby those who view our positions sympathetically, and who are more\\r\\ninclined to praise than to blame.  He who looks back upon the past is\\r\\nstruck with the fact that books which have been lauded to the skies in\\r\\none age have often been subjected to searching criticism and to a good\\r\\ndeal of condemnation in the next.  Something very like this is to be\\r\\nexpected of books written in our own time.  It is, however, a pity that\\r\\nwe should have to wait so long for impartial criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis leads me to say a word of the reviews which fill our philosophical\\r\\njournals, and which we must read, for it is impossible to read all the\\r\\nbooks that come out, and yet we wish to know something about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the novice it is something of a surprise to find that books by men\\r\\nwhom he knows to be eminent for their ingenuity and their learning are\\r\\ncondemned in very offhand fashion by quite young men, who as yet have\\r\\nattained to little learning and to no eminence at all.  One sometimes\\r\\nis tempted to wonder that men admittedly remarkable should have\\r\\nfathered such poor productions as we are given to understand them to\\r\\nbe, and should have offered them to a public that has a right to be\\r\\nindignant.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there can be no doubt that, in philosophy, a cat has the right to\\r\\nlook at a king, and has also a right to point out his misdoings, if\\r\\nsuch there be.  But it seems just to indicate that, in this matter,\\r\\ncertain cautions should be observed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a great man has been guilty of an error in reasoning, there is no\\r\\nreason why it should not be pointed out by any one who is capable of\\r\\ndetecting it.  The authority of the critic is a matter of no moment\\r\\nwhere the evidence is given.  In such a case, we take a suggestion and\\r\\nwe do the criticising for ourselves.  But where the evidence is not\\r\\ngiven, where the justice of the criticism is not proved, the case is\\r\\ndifferent.  Here we must take into consideration the authority of the\\r\\ncritic, and, if we follow him at all, we must follow him blindly.  Is\\r\\nit safe to do this?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is never safe in philosophy, or, at any rate, it is safe so seldom\\r\\nthat the exceptions are not worth taking into account.  Men write from\\r\\nthe standpoint of some school of opinion; and, until we know their\\r\\nprepossessions, their statements that this is good, that is bad, the\\r\\nthird thing is profound, are of no significance whatever.  We should\\r\\nsimply set them aside, and try to find out from our reviewer what is\\r\\ncontained in the book under criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the evils arising out of the bias I am discussing is, that books\\r\\nand authors are praised or condemned indiscriminately because of their\\r\\npoint of view, and little discrimination is made between good books and\\r\\npoor books.  There is all the difference in the world between a work\\r\\nwhich can be condemned only on the ground that it is realistic or\\r\\nidealistic in its standpoint, and those feeble productions which are to\\r\\nbe condemned from every point of view.  If we consistently carry out\\r\\nthe principle that we may condemn all those who are not of our party,\\r\\nwe must give short shrift to a majority of the great men of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I say, beware of authority in philosophy, and, above all, beware of\\r\\nthat most insidious form of authority, the spirit of the \"school.\"  It\\r\\ncannot but narrow our sympathies and restrict our outlook.\\r\\n\\r\\n91. REMEMBER THAT ORDINARY RULES OF EVIDENCE APPLY.--What I am going to\\r\\nsay in this section is closely related to what has been said just\\r\\nabove.  To the disinterested observer it may seem rather amusing that\\r\\none should think it worth while to try to show that we have not the\\r\\nright to use a special set of weights and measures when we are dealing\\r\\nwith things philosophical.  There was a time when men held that a given\\r\\ndoctrine could be philosophically false, and, at the same time,\\r\\ntheologically true; but surely the day of such twists and turnings is\\r\\npast!\\r\\n\\r\\nI am by no means sure that it is past.  With the lapse of time, old\\r\\ndoctrines take on new aspects, and come to be couched in a language\\r\\nthat suits the temper of the later age.  Sometimes the doctrine is\\r\\nveiled and rendered less startling, but remains essentially what it was\\r\\nbefore, and may be criticised in much the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose we may say that every one who is animated by the party spirit\\r\\ndiscussed above, and who holds to a group of philosophical tenets with\\r\\na warmth of conviction out of proportion to the authority of the actual\\r\\nevidence which may be claimed for them, is tacitly assuming that the\\r\\ntruth or falsity of philosophical dogmas is not wholly a matter of\\r\\nevidence, but that the desires of the philosopher may also be taken\\r\\ninto account.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis position is often taken unconsciously.  Thus, when, instead of\\r\\nproving to others that a given doctrine is false, we try to show them\\r\\nthat it is a dangerous doctrine, and leads to unpalatable consequences,\\r\\nwe assume that what seems distasteful cannot be true, and we count on\\r\\nthe fact that men incline to believe what they like to believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nMay we give this position the dignity of a philosophical doctrine and\\r\\nhold that, in the somewhat nebulous realm inhabited by the philosopher,\\r\\nmen are not bound by the same rules of evidence that obtain elsewhere?\\r\\nThat this is actually done, those who read much in the field of modern\\r\\nphilosophy are well aware.  Several excellent writers have maintained\\r\\nthat we need not, even if there seems to be evidence for them, accept\\r\\nviews of the universe which do not satisfy \"our whole nature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should not confuse with this position the very different one which\\r\\nmaintains that we have a right to hold tentatively, and with a\\r\\nwillingness to abandon them should evidence against them be\\r\\nforthcoming, views which we are not able completely to establish, but\\r\\nwhich seem reasonable.  One may do this with perfect sincerity, and\\r\\nwithout holding that philosophical truth is in any way different from\\r\\nscientific truth.  But the other position goes beyond this; it assumes\\r\\nthat man must be satisfied, and that only that can be true which\\r\\nsatisfies him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ask, is it not significant that such an assumption should be made\\r\\nonly in the realm of the unverifiable?  No man dreams of maintaining\\r\\nthat the rise and fall of stocks will be such as to satisfy the whole\\r\\nnature even of the elect, or that the future history of man on this\\r\\nplanet is a thing to be determined by some philosopher who decides for\\r\\nus what would or would not be desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurely all truths of election--those truths that we simply choose to\\r\\nhave true--are something much less august than that Truth of Evidence\\r\\nwhich sometimes seems little to fall in with our desires, and in the\\r\\nface of which we are humble listeners, not dictators.  Before the\\r\\nlatter we are modest; we obey, lest we be confounded.  And if, in the\\r\\nphilosophic realm, we believe that we may order Truth about, and make\\r\\nher our slave, is it not because we have a secret consciousness that we\\r\\nare not dealing with Truth at all, but with Opinion, and with Opinion\\r\\nthat has grown insolent because she cannot be drawn from her obscurity\\r\\nand be shown to be what she is?\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes it is suddenly revealed to a man that he has been accepting\\r\\ntwo orders of truth.  I once walked and talked with a good scholar who\\r\\ndiscoursed of high themes and defended warmly certain theses.  I said\\r\\nto him: If you could go into the house opposite, and discover\\r\\nunmistakably whether you are in the right or in the wrong,--discover it\\r\\nas unmistakably as you can discover whether there is or is not\\r\\nfurniture in the drawing-room,--would you go?  He thought over the\\r\\nmatter for a while, and then answered frankly; No! I should not go; I\\r\\nshould stay out here and argue it out.\\r\\n\\r\\n92. AIM AT CLEARNESS AND SIMPLICITY.--There is no department of\\r\\ninvestigation in which it is not desirable to cultivate clearness and\\r\\nsimplicity in thinking, speaking, and writing.  But there are certain\\r\\nreasons why we should be especially on our guard in philosophy against\\r\\nthe danger of employing a tongue \"not understanded of the people.\"\\r\\nThere are dangerous pitfalls concealed under the use of technical words\\r\\nand phrases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe value of technical expressions in the special sciences must be\\r\\nconceded.  They are supposed to be more exact and less ambiguous than\\r\\nterms in ordinary use, and they mark an advance in our knowledge of the\\r\\nsubject.  The distinctions which they indicate have been carefully\\r\\ndrawn, and appear to be of such authority that they should be generally\\r\\naccepted.  Sometimes, as, for example, in mathematics, a conventional\\r\\nset of symbols may quite usurp the function of ordinary language, and\\r\\nmay enormously curtail the labor of setting forth the processes and\\r\\nresults of investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we must never forget that we have not in philosophy an\\r\\nauthoritative body of truth which we have the right to impose upon all\\r\\nwho enter that field.  A multitude of distinctions have been made and\\r\\nare made; but the representatives of different schools of thought are\\r\\nnot at one touching the value and significance of these distinctions.\\r\\nIf we coin a word or a phrase to mark such, there is some danger that\\r\\nwe fall into the habit of using such words or phrases, as we use the\\r\\ncoins in our purse, without closely examining them, and with the ready\\r\\nassumption that they must pass current everywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, there is always a possibility that our technical expressions may\\r\\nbe nothing less than crystallized error.  Against this we should surely\\r\\nbe on our guard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain.  When we translate the language of common life into the dialect\\r\\nof the learned, there is danger that we may fall into the error of\\r\\nsupposing that we are adding to our knowledge, even though we are doing\\r\\nnothing save to exchange one set of words for another.  Thus, we all\\r\\nknow very well that one mind can communicate with another.  One does\\r\\nnot have to be a scholar to be aware of this.  If we choose to call\\r\\nthis \"intersubjective intercourse,\" we have given the thing a sounding\\r\\nname; but we know no more about it than we did before.  The problem of\\r\\nthe relation between minds, and the way in which they are to be\\r\\nconceived as influencing each other, remains just what it was.  So,\\r\\nalso, we recognize the everyday fact that we know both ourselves and\\r\\nwhat is not ourselves.  Shall we call this knowledge of something not\\r\\nourselves \"self-transcendence\"?  We may do so if we wish, but we ought\\r\\nto realize that this bestowal of a title makes no whit clearer what is\\r\\nmeant by knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnhappily, men too often believe that, when they have come into the\\r\\npossession of a new word or phrase, they have gained a new thought.\\r\\nThe danger is great in proportion to the breadth of the gulf which\\r\\nseparates the new dialect from the old language of common life in which\\r\\nwe are accustomed to estimate things.  Many a philosopher would be\\r\\nbereft, indeed, were he robbed of his vocabulary and compelled to\\r\\nexpress his thoughts in ordinary speech.  The theories which are\\r\\nimplicit in certain recurring expressions would be forced to come out\\r\\ninto the open, and stand criticism without disguise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut can one write philosophical books without using words which are not\\r\\nin common use among the unphilosophic?  I doubt it.  Some such words it\\r\\nseems impossible to avoid.  However, it does seem possible to bear in\\r\\nmind the dangers of a special philosophical terminology and to reduce\\r\\nsuch words to a minimum.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we may appeal to the humanity of the philosopher.  The path to\\r\\nreflection is a sufficiently difficult one as it is; why should he roll\\r\\nrocks upon it and compel those who come after him to climb over them?\\r\\nIf truths are no truer for being expressed in a repellent form, why\\r\\nshould he trick them out in a fantastic garb?  What we want is the\\r\\nnaked truth, and we lose time and patience in freeing our mummy from\\r\\nthe wrappings in which learned men have seen fit to encase it.\\r\\n\\r\\n93. DO NOT HASTILY ACCEPT A DOCTRINE.--This brings me to the last of\\r\\nthe maxims which I urge upon the attention of the reader.  All that has\\r\\nbeen said so far may be regarded as leading up to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulty that confronts us is this: On the one hand, we must\\r\\nrecognize the uncertainty that reigns in this field of investigation.\\r\\nWe must ever weigh probabilities and possibilities; we do not find\\r\\nourselves in the presence of indubitable truths which all competent\\r\\npersons stand ready to admit.  This seems to argue that we should learn\\r\\nto suspend judgment, and should be most wary in our acceptance of one\\r\\nphilosophical doctrine and our rejection of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, philosophy is not a mere matter of intellectual\\r\\ncuriosity.  It has an intimate connection with life.  As a man thinks,\\r\\nso is he, to a great extent, at least.  How, then, can one afford to\\r\\nremain critical and negative?  To counsel this seems equivalent to\\r\\nadvising that one abandon the helm and consent to float at the mercy of\\r\\nwind and tide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulty is a very real one.  It presents itself insistently to\\r\\nthose who have attained to that degree of intellectual development at\\r\\nwhich one begins to ask oneself questions and to reflect upon the worth\\r\\nand meaning of life.  An unreflective adherence to tradition no longer\\r\\nsatisfies such persons.  They wish to know why they should believe in\\r\\nthis or that doctrine, and why they should rule their lives in harmony\\r\\nwith this or that maxim.  Shall we advise them to lay hold without\\r\\ndelay of a set of philosophical tenets, as we might advise a disabled\\r\\nman to aid himself with any staff that happens to come to hand?  Or\\r\\nshall we urge them to close their eyes to the light, and to go back\\r\\nagain to the old unreflective life?\\r\\n\\r\\nNeither of these counsels seems satisfactory, for both assume tacitly\\r\\nthat it does not much matter what the _truth_ is, and that we can\\r\\nafford to disregard it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps we may take a suggestion from that prudent man and acute\\r\\nphilosopher, Descartes.  Discontented with the teachings of the schools\\r\\nas they had been presented to him, he resolved to set out upon an\\r\\nindependent voyage of discovery, and to look for a philosophy of his\\r\\nown.  It seemed necessary to him to doubt, provisionally at least, all\\r\\nthat he had received from the past.  But in what house should he live\\r\\nwhile he was reconstructing his old habitation?  Without principles of\\r\\nsome sort he could not live, and without reasonable principles he could\\r\\nnot live well.  So he framed a set of provisional rules, which should\\r\\nguide his life until he had new ground beneath his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we examine these rules, we find that, on the whole, they are such\\r\\nas the experience of mankind has found prudent and serviceable.  In\\r\\nother words, we discover that Descartes, until he was in a position to\\r\\nsee clearly for himself, was willing to be led by others.  He was a\\r\\nunit in the social order, and he recognized that truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does not seem out of place to recall this fact to the consciousness\\r\\nof those who are entering upon the reflective life.  Those who are\\r\\nrather new to reflection upon philosophical matters are apt to seize\\r\\nsingle truths, which are too often half-truths, and to deduce their\\r\\nconsequences remorselessly.  They do not always realize the extreme\\r\\ncomplexity of society, or see the full meaning of the relations in\\r\\nwhich they stand to the state and to the church.  Breadth of view can\\r\\nonly come with an increase of knowledge and with the exercise of\\r\\nreflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason I advise patience, and a willingness to accept the\\r\\nestablished order of things until one is very sure that one has\\r\\nattained to some truth--some real truth, not a mere truth of\\r\\nelection--which may serve as the basis of a reconstruction.  The first\\r\\nglimpses of truth cannot be depended upon to furnish such a foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we may suspend judgment, and, nevertheless, be ready to act.  But\\r\\nis not this a mere compromise?  Certainly.  All life is a compromise;\\r\\nand in the present instance it means only that we should keep our eyes\\r\\nopen to the light, whatever its source, and yet should nourish that\\r\\nwholesome self-distrust that prevents a man from being an erratic and\\r\\nrevolutionary creature, unmindful of his own limitations.  Prudent men\\r\\nin all walks in life make this compromise, and the world is the better\\r\\nfor it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I, sections 1-5.  If the student will take a good history of\\r\\nphilosophy, and look over the accounts of the different systems\\r\\nreferred to, he will see the justice of the position taken in the text,\\r\\nnamely, that philosophy was formerly synonymous with universal\\r\\nknowledge.  It is not necessary, of course, to read the whole history\\r\\nof philosophy to attain this end.  One may take such a text-book as\\r\\nUeberweg\\'s \"History of Philosophy,\" and run over the summaries\\r\\ncontained in the large print.  To see how the conception of what\\r\\nconstitutes universal knowledge changed in successive ages, compare\\r\\nThales, the Sophists, Aristotle, the Schoolmen, Bacon, and Descartes.\\r\\nFor the ancient philosophy one may consult Windelband\\'s \"History of the\\r\\nAncient Philosophy,\" a clear and entertaining little work (English\\r\\ntranslation, N.Y., 1899).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Professor Paulsen\\'s \"Introduction to Philosophy\" (English\\r\\ntranslation, N.Y., 1895), there is an interesting introductory chapter\\r\\non \"The Nature and Import of Philosophy\" (pp. 1-41).  The author pleads\\r\\nfor the old notion of philosophy as universal knowledge, though he does\\r\\nnot, of course, mean that the philosopher must be familiar with all the\\r\\ndetails of all the sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 6.  In justification of the meaning given to the word\\r\\n\"philosophy\" in this section, I ask the reader to look over the list of\\r\\ncourses in philosophy advertised in the catalogues of our leading\\r\\nuniversities at home and abroad.  There is a certain consensus of\\r\\nopinion as to what properly comes under the title, even among those who\\r\\ndiffer widely as to what is the proper definition of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II, sections 7-10.  Read the chapter on \"The Mind and the World\\r\\nin Common Thought and in Science\" (Chapter I) in my \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics,\" N.Y., 1904.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne can be brought to a vivid realization of the fact that the sciences\\r\\nproceed upon a basis of assumptions which they do not attempt to\\r\\nanalyze and justify, if one will take some elementary work on\\r\\narithmetic or geometry or psychology and examine the first few\\r\\nchapters, bearing in mind what philosophical problems may be drawn from\\r\\nthe materials there treated.  Section 11.  The task of reflective\\r\\nthought and its difficulties are treated in the chapter entitled \"How\\r\\nThings are Given in Consciousness\" (Chapter III), in my \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III, sections 12-13.  Read \"The Inadequacy of the Psychological\\r\\nStandpoint,\" \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapter II.  I call especial\\r\\nattention to the illustration of \"the man in the cell\" (pp. 18 ff.).\\r\\nIt would be a good thing to read these pages with the class, and to\\r\\nimpress upon the students the fact that those who have doubted or\\r\\ndenied the existence of the external material world have, if they have\\r\\nfallen into error, fallen into a very natural error, and are not\\r\\nwithout some excuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 14.  See \"The Metaphysics of the Telephone Exchange,\" \"System\\r\\nof Metaphysics,\" Chapter XXII, where Professor Pearson\\'s doctrine is\\r\\nexamined at length, with quotations and references.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is interesting to notice that a doubt of the external world has\\r\\nalways rested upon some sort of a \"telephone exchange\" argument;\\r\\nnaturally, it could not pass by that name before the invention of the\\r\\ntelephone, but the reasoning is the same.  It puts the world at one\\r\\nremove, shutting the mind up to the circle of its ideas; and then it\\r\\ndoubts or denies the world, or, at least, holds that its existence must\\r\\nbe proved in some roundabout way.  Compare Descartes, \"Of the Existence\\r\\nof Material Things,\" \"Meditations,\" VI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV, sections 15-18.  See Chapters VI and VII, \"What we mean by\\r\\nthe External World,\" and \"Sensations and \\'Things,\\'\" in my \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics.\"  In that work the discussion of the distinction between\\r\\nthe objective order of experience and the subjective order is completed\\r\\nin Chapter XXIII, \"The Distinction between the World and the Mind.\"\\r\\nThis was done that the subjective order might be treated in the part of\\r\\nthe book which discusses the mind and its relation to matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it is possible that the reader may be puzzled by differences of\\r\\nexpression which obtain in the two books, a word of explanation is not\\r\\nout of place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the \"Metaphysics,\" for example, it is said that sensations so\\r\\nconnect themselves together as to form what we call the system of\\r\\nmaterial things (p. 105).  It is intimated in a footnote that this is a\\r\\nprovisional statement and the reader is referred to later chapters.\\r\\nNow, in the present book (sections 16-17), it is taught that we may not\\r\\ncall material things groups of sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe apparent contradiction is due to the fact that, in this volume, the\\r\\nfull meaning of the word \"sensation\" is exhibited at the outset, and\\r\\nsensations, as phenomena of the subjective order, are distinguished\\r\\nfrom the phenomena of the objective order which constitute the external\\r\\nworld.  In the earlier work the word \"sensation\" was for a while used\\r\\nloosely to cover all our experiences that do not belong to the class\\r\\ncalled imaginary, and the distinction between the subjective and\\r\\nobjective in this realm was drawn later (Chapter XXIII).\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the present arrangement is the better one, as it avoids from\\r\\nthe outset the suggestion that the real world is something\\r\\nsubjective--our sensations or ideas--and thus escapes the idealistic\\r\\nflavor which almost inevitably attaches to the other treatment, until\\r\\nthe discussion is completed, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V, sections 10-21.  See Chapters VIII and IX, \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics,\" \"The Distinction between Appearance and Reality\" and \"The\\r\\nSignificance of the Distinction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 22.  See Chapter XXVI, \"The World as Unperceived, and the\\r\\n\\'Unknowable,\\'\" where Spencer\\'s doctrine is examined at length, and\\r\\nreferences are given.  I think it is very important that the student\\r\\nshould realize that the \"Unknowable\" is a perfectly useless assumption\\r\\nin philosophy, and can serve no purpose whatever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI, sections 23-25.  See Chapters X and XI, \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics,\" \"The Kantian Doctrine of Space\" and \"Difficulties\\r\\nconnected with the Kantian Doctrine of Space.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be an excellent thing for the student, after he has read the\\r\\nabove chapters, to take up Kant\\'s \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" and read\\r\\nand analyze the argument of Antinomies I and II, with the Observations\\r\\nappended.  One can understand these arguments without being familiar\\r\\nwith the \"Critique\" as a whole; at any rate, the account of Kant\\'s\\r\\nphilosophy contained in section 51 of this book will serve to explain\\r\\nhis use of certain terms, such as \"the laws of our sensibility.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKant\\'s reasonings are very curious and interesting in this part of his\\r\\nbook.  It seems to be proved that the world must be endless in space\\r\\nand without a beginning or end in time, and just as plausibly proved\\r\\nthat it cannot be either.  It seems to be proved that finite spaces and\\r\\ntimes are infinitely divisible, and at the same time that they cannot\\r\\nbe infinitely divisible.  The situation is an amusing one, and rendered\\r\\nnot the less amusing by the seriousness with which the mutually\\r\\ndestructive arguments are taken.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the student meets such a tangle in the writings of any\\r\\nphilosopher, I ask him to believe that it is not the human reason that\\r\\nis at fault--at least, let him not assume that it is.  The fault\\r\\nprobably lies with a human reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 26.  See Chapter XII, \"The Berkeleian Doctrine of Space,\" in my\\r\\n\"System of Metaphysics.\"  The argument ought not to be difficult to one\\r\\nwho has mastered Chapter V of this volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII, sections 27-29.  Compare Chapter XIII, \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics,\" \"Of Time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the chapters on Space and Time it would be well for the student to\\r\\nread Chapter XIV, \"The Real World in Space and Time,\" where it is made\\r\\nclear why we have no hesitation in declaring space and time to be\\r\\ninfinite, although we recognize that it seems to be an assumption of\\r\\nknowledge to declare the material world infinite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII, sections 30-32.  Read, in the \"System of Metaphysics,\"\\r\\nChapters V and XVII, \"The Self or Knower\" and \"The Atomic Self.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 33.  The suggestions, touching the attitude of the psychologist\\r\\ntoward the mind, contained in the preface to Professor William James\\'s\\r\\n\"Psychology\" are very interesting and instructive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX, sections 35-36.  For a strong argument in favor of\\r\\ninteractionism see James\\'s \"Psychology,\" Chapter V.  I wish the student\\r\\nwould, in reading it, bear in mind what is said in my chapter on \"The\\r\\nAtomic Self,\" above referred to.  The subject should be approached with\\r\\nan open mind, and one should suspend judgment until both sides have\\r\\nbeen heard from.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 37.  Descartes held that the lower animals are automata and\\r\\nthat their actions are not indicative of consciousness; he regarded\\r\\ntheir bodies as machines lacking the soul in the \"little pineal gland.\"\\r\\nProfessor Huxley revived the doctrine of animal automatism and extended\\r\\nit so as to include man.  He regarded consciousness as a \"collateral\\r\\nproduct\" of the working of the body, related to it somewhat as is the\\r\\nsteam-whistle of a locomotive engine to the working of the machine.  He\\r\\nmade it an effect, but not a cause, of motions.  See \"System of\\r\\nMetaphysics,\" Chapter XVIII, \"The Automaton Theory: its Genesis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe owe the doctrine of parallelism, in its original form, to Spinoza.\\r\\nIt was elaborated by W. K. Clifford, and to him the modern interest in\\r\\nthe subject is largely due.  The whole subject is discussed at length\\r\\nin my \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapters XIX-XXI.  The titles are: \"The\\r\\nAutomaton Theory: Parallelism,\" \"What is Parallelism?\" and \"The Man and\\r\\nthe Candlestick.\"  Clifford\\'s doctrine is presented in a new form in\\r\\nProfessor Strong\\'s recent brilliant work, \"Why the Mind has a Body\"\\r\\nN.Y., 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 38.  See \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapter XXIV, \"The Time and\\r\\nPlace of Sensations and Ideas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X, sections 40-42.  See \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapters XXVII\\r\\nand XXVIII, \"The Existence of Other Minds,\" and \"The Distribution of\\r\\nMinds.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWriters seem to be divided into three camps on this question of other\\r\\nminds.\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) I have treated our knowledge of other minds as due to an inference.\\r\\nThis is the position usually taken.\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) We have seen that Huxley and Clifford cast doubts upon the validity\\r\\nof the inference, but, nevertheless, made it.  Professor Strong, in the\\r\\nwork mentioned in the notes to the previous chapter, maintains that it\\r\\nis not an inference, and that we do not directly perceive other minds,\\r\\nbut that we are assured of their existence just the same.  He makes our\\r\\nknowledge an \"intuition\" in the old-fashioned sense of the word, a\\r\\nsomething to be accepted but not to be accounted for.\\r\\n\\r\\n(3) Writers who have been influenced more or less by the Neo-Kantian or\\r\\nNeo-Hegelian doctrine are apt to speak as though we had the same direct\\r\\nevidence of the existence of other minds that we have of the existence\\r\\nof our own.  I have never seen a systematic and detailed exposition of\\r\\nthis doctrine.  It appears rather in the form of hints dropped in\\r\\npassing.  A number of such are to be found in Taylor\\'s \"Elements of\\r\\nMetaphysics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 43. The \"Mind-stuff\" doctrine is examined at length and its\\r\\norigin discussed in Chapter XXXI of the \"System of Metaphysics,\"\\r\\n\"Mental Phenomena and the Causal Nexus.\"  It is well worth while for\\r\\nthe student to read the whole of Clifford\\'s essay \"On the Nature of\\r\\nThings-in-themselves,\" even if he is pressed for time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI, section 44.  See \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapter XV, \"The\\r\\nWorld as Mechanism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 45.  See Chapter XXXI, \"The Place of Mind in Nature.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 46.  For a definition of Fatalism, and a description of its\\r\\ndifference from the scientific doctrine of Determinism, see Chapter\\r\\nXXXIII, \"Fatalism, \\'Freewill\\' and Determinism.\"  For a vigorous defense\\r\\nof \"Freewill\" (which is not, in my opinion, free will at all, in the\\r\\ncommon acceptation of the word) see Professor James\\'s Essay on \"The\\r\\nDilemma of the Determinist,\" in his volume, \"The Will to Believe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFatalism and Determinism are constantly confused, and much of the\\r\\nopposition to Determinism is attributable to this confusion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 47.  See Chapter XXXII, \"Mechanism and Teleology.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII, section 48.  The notes to Chapter III (see above) are in\\r\\npoint here.  It is well worth the student\\'s while to read the whole of\\r\\nChapter XI, Book IV, of Locke\\'s \"Essay.\"  It is entitled \"Of our\\r\\nKnowledge of the Existence of Other Things.\"  Notice the headings of\\r\\nsome of his sections:--\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 1.  \"It is to be had only by sensation.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 2.  \"Instance whiteness of this paper.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  \"This, though not so certain as demonstration, yet may be\\r\\ncalled \\'Knowledge,\\' and proves the existence of things without us.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke\\'s argument proceeds, as we have seen, on the assumption that we\\r\\nperceive external things directly,--an assumption into which he slips\\r\\nunawares,--and yet he cannot allow that we really do perceive directly\\r\\nwhat is external.  This makes him uncomfortably conscious that he has\\r\\nnot absolute proof, after all.  The section that closes the discussion\\r\\nis entitled: \"Folly to expect demonstration in everything.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 49.  I wish that I could believe that every one of my readers\\r\\nwould sometime give himself the pleasure of reading through Berkeley\\'s\\r\\n\"Principles of Human Knowledge\" and his \"Three Dialogues between Hylas\\r\\nand Philonous.\"  Clearness of thought, beauty of style, and elevation\\r\\nof sentiment characterize them throughout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Principles\" is a systematic treatise.  If one has not time to read\\r\\nit all, one can get a good idea of the doctrine by running through the\\r\\nfirst forty-one sections.  For brief readings in class, to illustrate\\r\\nBerkeley\\'s reasoning, one may take sections 1-3, 14, 18-20, and 38.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Dialogues\" is a more popular work.  As the etymology of the names\\r\\nin the title suggests, we have in it a dispute between a man who pins\\r\\nhis faith to matter and an idealist.  The aim of the book is to confute\\r\\nskeptics and atheists from the standpoint of idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Hume\\'s treatment of the external world, see his \"Treatise of Human\\r\\nNature,\" Part IV, section 2.  For his treatment of the mind, see Part\\r\\nIV, section 6.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 50.  Reid repeats himself a great deal, for he gives us\\r\\nasseveration rather than proof.  One can get the gist of his argument\\r\\nby reading carefully a few of his sections.  It would be a good\\r\\nexercise to read in class, if time permitted, the two sections of his\\r\\n\"Inquiry\" entitled \"Of Extension\" (Chapter V, section 5), and \"Of\\r\\nPerception in General\" (Chapter VI, section 20).\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 51.  For an account of the critical Philosophy, see\\r\\nFalckenberg\\'s \"History of Modern Philosophy\" (English translation,\\r\\nN.Y., 1893).  Compare with this the accounts in the histories of\\r\\nphilosophy by Ueberweg and H\\xc3\\xb6ffding (English translation of the latter,\\r\\nLondon, 1900).  Full bibliographies are to be found especially in\\r\\nUeberweg.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to look at the philosophy of Kant through more than one pair\\r\\nof eyes.  Thus, if one reads Morris\\'s \"Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason\"\\r\\n(Chicago, 1882), one should read also Sidgwick\\'s \"Lectures on the\\r\\nPhilosophy of Kant\" (N.Y., 1905).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIII, section 52.  It is difficult to see how Hamilton could\\r\\nregard himself as a \"natural\" realist (the word is employed by him).\\r\\nSee his \"Lectures on Metaphysics,\" VIII, where he develops his\\r\\ndoctrine.  He seems to teach, in spite of himself, that we can know\\r\\ndirectly only the impressions that things make on us, and must infer\\r\\nall else: \"Our whole knowledge of mind and matter is, thus, only\\r\\nrelative; of existence, absolutely and in itself, we know nothing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhom may we regard as representing the three kinds of \"hypothetical\\r\\nrealism\" described in the text?  Perhaps we may put the plain man, who\\r\\nhas not begun to reflect, in the first class.  John Locke is a good\\r\\nrepresentative of the second; see the \"Essay concerning Human\\r\\nUnderstanding,\" Book II, Chapter VIII.  Herbert Spencer belonged to the\\r\\nthird while he wrote Chapter V of his \"First Principles of Philosophy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 53.  I have said enough of the Berkeleian idealism in the notes\\r\\non Chapter XII.  As a good illustration of objective idealism in one of\\r\\nits forms I may take the doctrine of Professor Royce; see his address,\\r\\n\"The Conception of God\" (N.Y., 1902).\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bradley\\'s doctrine is criticised in Chapter XXXIV (entitled \"Of\\r\\nGod\"), \"System of Metaphysics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIV, section 55.  See \"System of Metaphysics,\" Chapter XVI,\\r\\n\"The Insufficiency of Materialism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 56.  Professor Strong\\'s volume, \"Why the Mind has a Body\"\\r\\n(N.Y., 1903), advocates a panpsychism much like that of Clifford.  It\\r\\nis very clearly written, and with Clifford\\'s essay on \"The Nature of\\r\\nThings-in-themselves,\" ought to give one a good idea of the\\r\\nconsiderations that impel some able men to become panpsychists.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 57.  The pantheistic monism of Spinoza is of such importance\\r\\nhistorically that it is desirable to obtain a clear notion of its\\r\\nmeaning.  I have discussed this at length in two earlier works: \"The\\r\\nPhilosophy of Spinoza\" (N.Y., 1894) and \"On Spinozistic Immortality.\"\\r\\nThe student is referred to the account of Spinoza\\'s \"God or Substance\"\\r\\ncontained in these.  See, especially, the \"Introductory Note\" in the\\r\\nback of the first-mentioned volume.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Royce is a good illustration of the idealistic monist; see\\r\\nthe volume referred to in the note above (section 53).  His \"Absolute,\"\\r\\nor God, is conceived to be an all-inclusive mind of which our finite\\r\\nminds are parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 58.  Sir William Hamilton\\'s dualism is developed in his\\r\\n\"Lectures on Metaphysics,\" VIII.  He writes: \"Mind and matter, as known\\r\\nor knowable, are only two different series of phenomena or qualities;\\r\\nas unknown and unknowable, they are the two substances in which these\\r\\ntwo different series of phenomena or qualities are supposed to inhere.\\r\\nThe existence of an unknown substance is only an inference we are\\r\\ncompelled to make, from the existence of known phenomena; and the\\r\\ndistinction of two substances is only inferred from the seeming\\r\\nincompatibility of the two series of phenomena to coinhere in one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XV, section 60.  The reader will find Descartes\\'s path traced\\r\\nin the \"Meditations.\"  In I, we have his sweeping doubt; in II, his\\r\\ndoctrine as to the mind; in III, the existence of God is established;\\r\\nin VI, he gets around to the existence of the external world.  We find\\r\\na good deal of the \"natural light\" in the first part of his \"Principles\\r\\nof Philosophy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 61.  We have an excellent illustration of Locke\\'s inconsistency\\r\\nin violating his own principles and going beyond experience, in his\\r\\ntreatment of \"Substance.\"  Read, in his \"Essay,\" Book I, Chapter IV,\\r\\nsection 18, and Book II, Chapter XXIII, section 4.  These sections are\\r\\nnot long, and might well be read and analyzed in class.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 62.  See the note to section 51.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 64.  I write this note (in 1908) to give the reader some idea\\r\\nof later developments of the doctrine called pragmatism.  There has\\r\\nbeen a vast amount printed upon the subject in the last two or three\\r\\nyears, but I am not able to say even yet that we have to do with \"a\\r\\nclear-cut doctrine, the limits and consequences of which have been\\r\\nworked out in detail.\"  Hence, I prefer to leave section 64 as I first\\r\\nwrote it, merely supplementing it here.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may fairly consider the three leaders of the pragmatic movement to\\r\\nbe Professor William James, Dr. F. C. S. Schiller, and Professor John\\r\\nDewey.  The first has developed his doctrine at length in his volume\\r\\nentitled \"Pragmatism\" (London, 1907); the second, who calls his\\r\\ndoctrine \"Humanism,\" but declares himself a pragmatist, and in\\r\\nessential agreement with Professor James, has published two volumes of\\r\\nphilosophical essays entitled \"Humanism\" (London, 1903) and \"Studies in\\r\\nHumanism\" (London, 1907); the third has developed his position in the\\r\\nfirst four chapters of the \"Studies in Logical Theory\" (Chicago, 1903).\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor James, in his \"Pragmatism\" (Lecture II), says that\\r\\npragmatism, at the outset, at least, stands for no particular results.\\r\\nIt has no dogmas, and no doctrines save its method.  This method means:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The attitude of looking away from first things, principles,\\r\\n\\'categories,\\' supposed necessities; and of looking towards last things,\\r\\nfruits, consequences, facts.\"  He remarks further, however, that\\r\\npragmatism has come to be used also in a wider sense, as signifying a\\r\\ncertain theory of truth (pp. 54-55).  This theory is brought forward in\\r\\nLecture VI.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theory maintains that: \"True ideas are those that we can\\r\\nassimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify.  False ideas are those\\r\\nthat we can not\" (p. 201).  This sounds as though Professor James\\r\\nabandoned his doctrine touching the Turk and the Christian mentioned in\\r\\nsection 64.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what do the words \"verification\" and \"validation\" pragmatically\\r\\nmean?  We are told that they signify certain practical consequences of\\r\\nthe verified and validated idea.  Our ideas may be said to \"agree\" with\\r\\nreality when they lead us, through acts and other ideas which they\\r\\ninstigate, up to or towards other parts of experience with which we\\r\\nfeel that the original ideas remain in agreement.  \"The connections and\\r\\ntransitions come to us from point to point as being progressive,\\r\\nharmonious, satisfactory.  This function of agreeable leading is what\\r\\nwe mean by an idea\\'s verification\" (p. 202).\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we do not seem to be concerned with verification in the sense in\\r\\nwhich the word has usually been employed heretofore.  The tendency to\\r\\ntake as true what is useful or serviceable has not been abandoned.\\r\\nThat Professor James does not really leave his Turk in the lurch\\r\\nbecomes clear to any one who will read his book attentively and note\\r\\nhis reasons for taking the various pragmatic attitudes which he does\\r\\ntake.  See, for example, his pragmatic argument for \"free-will.\"  The\\r\\ndoctrine is simply assumed as a doctrine of \"relief\" (pp. 110-121).\\r\\n\\r\\nBriefly stated, Dr. Schiller\\'s doctrine is that truths are man-made,\\r\\nand that it is right for man to consult his desires in making them.  It\\r\\nis in substantial harmony with the pragmatism of Professor James, and I\\r\\nshall not dwell upon it.  Dr. Schiller\\'s essays are very entertainingly\\r\\nwritten.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Dewey\\'s pragmatism seems to me sufficiently different from\\r\\nthe above to merit another title.  In the \"Journal of Philosophy,\\r\\nPsychology, and Scientific Methods,\" Volume IV, No. 4, Professor Dewey\\r\\nbrings out the distinction between his own position and that of\\r\\nProfessor James.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the periodical literature on pragmatism I cannot refer in detail.\\r\\nProfessor James defends his position against misconceptions in the\\r\\n\"Philosophical Review,\" Volume XVII, No. 1.  See, on the other side,\\r\\nProfessor Perry, in the \"Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and\\r\\nScientific Methods,\" Volume IV, pp. 365 and 421; Professor Hibben,\\r\\n\"Philosophical Review,\" XVII, 4; and Dr. Carus, \"The Monist,\" July,\\r\\n1908.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVI, sections 65-68.  To see how the logicians have regarded\\r\\ntheir science and its relation to philosophy, see; Keynes\\'s \"Formal\\r\\nLogic\" (London, 1894), Introduction; Hobhouse\\'s \"Theory of Knowledge\"\\r\\n(London, 1896), Introduction; Aikins\\'s \"The Principles of Logic\" (N.Y.,\\r\\n1902), Introduction; and Creighton\\'s \"Introductory Logic\" (N.Y., 1898),\\r\\nPreface.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Aikins writes: \"Thus, in so far as logic tries to make us\\r\\nreason correctly by giving us correct conceptions of things and the way\\r\\nin which their relations involve each other, it is a kind of simple\\r\\nmetaphysics studied for a practical end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Creighton says, \"Although in treating the syllogistic logic I\\r\\nhave followed to a large extent the ordinary mode of presentation, I\\r\\nhave both here, and when dealing with the inductive methods, endeavored\\r\\nto interpret the traditional doctrines in a philosophical way, and to\\r\\nprepare for the theoretical discussions of the third part of the book.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Stuart Mill tried not to be metaphysical; but let the reader\\r\\nexamine, say, his third chapter, \"Of the Things denoted by Names,\" or\\r\\nlook over Book VI, in his \"System of Logic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Sigwart\\'s great work, \"Logik\" (Freiburg, 2d edition, Volume\\r\\nI, 1889, Volume II, 1893), may almost be called a philosophy of logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVII, section 69.  Compare with Professor James\\'s account of\\r\\nthe scope of psychology the following from Professor Baldwin: \"The\\r\\nquestion of the relation of psychology to metaphysics, over which a\\r\\nfierce warfare has been waged in recent years, is now fairly settled by\\r\\nthe adjustment of mutual claims. . . .  The terms of the adjustment of\\r\\nwhich I speak are briefly these: on the one hand, empirical\\r\\ninvestigation must precede rational interpretation, and this empirical\\r\\ninvestigation must be absolutely unhampered by fetters of dogmatism and\\r\\npreconception; on the other hand, rational interpretation must be\\r\\nequally free in its own province, since progress from the individual to\\r\\nthe general, from the detached fact to its universal meaning, can be\\r\\nsecured only by the judicious use of hypotheses, both metaphysical and\\r\\nspeculative.  Starting from the empirical we run out at every step into\\r\\nthe metempirical.\"  \"Handbook of Psychology,\" Preface, pp. iii and iv.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XVIII, section 71.  The teacher might very profitably take\\r\\nextracts from the two chapters of Whewell\\'s \"Elements of Morality\"\\r\\nreferred to in the text, and read them with the class.  It is\\r\\nsignificant of the weakness of Whewell\\'s position that he can give us\\r\\nadvice as long as we do not need it, but, when we come to the\\r\\ncross-roads, he is compelled to leave the matter to the individual\\r\\nconscience, and gives us no hint of a general principle that may guide\\r\\nus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 72.  Wundt, in his volume \"The Facts of the Moral Life\" (N.Y.,\\r\\n1897), tries to develop an empirical science of ethics independent of\\r\\nmetaphysics; see the Preface.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompare with this: Martineau\\'s \"Types of Ethical Theory\" (London,\\r\\n1885), Preface; T. H. Green\\'s \"Prolegomena to Ethics,\" Introduction;\\r\\nMuirhead\\'s \"The Elements of Ethics\" (N.Y., 1892); Mackenzie\\'s \"A Manual\\r\\nof Ethics\" (London, 1893); Jodl\\'s \"Gesduchte der Ethik\" (Stuttgart,\\r\\n1882), Preface.  I give but a few references, but they will serve to\\r\\nillustrate how close, in the opinion of ethical writers, is the\\r\\nrelation between ethics and philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XIX, section 74.  The student who turns over the pages of\\r\\nseveral works on metaphysics may be misled by a certain superficial\\r\\nsimilarity that is apt to obtain among them.  One sees the field mapped\\r\\nout into Ontology (the science of Being or Reality), Rational\\r\\nCosmology, and Rational Psychology.  These titles are mediaeval\\r\\nlandmarks which have been left standing.  I may as well warn the reader\\r\\nthat two men who discourse of Ontology may not be talking about the\\r\\nsame thing at all.  Bear in mind what was said in section 57 of the\\r\\ndifferent ways of conceiving the \"One Substance\"; and bear in mind also\\r\\nwhat was said in Chapter V of the proper meaning of the word \"reality.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI have discarded the above titles in my \"System of Metaphysics,\"\\r\\nbecause I think it is better and less misleading to use plain and\\r\\nunambiguous language.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 75.  See the note to Chapter XVI.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XX, sections 76-77.  One can get an idea of the problems with\\r\\nwhich the philosophy of religion has to deal by turning to my \"System\\r\\nof Metaphysics\" and reading the two chapters entitled \"Of God,\" at the\\r\\nclose of the book.  It would be interesting to read and criticise in\\r\\nclass some of the theistic arguments that philosophers have brought\\r\\nforward.  Quotations and references are given in Chapter XXXIV.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXI, sections 78-79.  What is said of the science of logic, in\\r\\nChapter XVI, has, of course, a bearing upon these sections.  I suggest\\r\\nthat the student examine a few chapters of \"The Grammar of Science\";\\r\\nthe book is very readable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXII, sections 80-82.  The reader will find in lectures I and\\r\\nII in Sir William Hamilton\\'s \"Lectures on Metaphysics\" a discussion of\\r\\nthe utility of philosophy.  It has a pleasant, old-fashioned flavor,\\r\\nand contains some good thoughts.  What is said in Chapters XVI-XXI of\\r\\nthe present volume has a good deal of bearing upon the subject.  See\\r\\nespecially what is said in the chapters on logic, ethics, and the\\r\\nphilosophy of religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIII, sections 83-87.  There is a rather brief but good and\\r\\nthoughtful discussion of the importance of historical study to the\\r\\ncomprehension of philosophical doctrines in Falckenberg\\'s \"History of\\r\\nModern Philosophy\" (English translation, N.Y., 1893); see the\\r\\nIntroduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have a good illustration of the fact that there may be parallel\\r\\nstreams of philosophic thought (section 87) when we turn to the Stoics\\r\\nand the Epicureans.  Zeno and Epicurus were contemporaries, but they\\r\\nwere men of very dissimilar character, and the schools they founded\\r\\ndiffered widely in spirit.  Zeno went back for his view of the physical\\r\\nworld to Heraclitus, and for his ethics to the Cynics.  Epicurus\\r\\nborrowed his fundamental thoughts from Democritus.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, philosophers may sometimes be regarded as links in\\r\\nthe one chain.  Witness the series of German thinkers: Kant, Fichte,\\r\\nSchelling, Hegel, Schopenhauer; or the series of British thinkers:\\r\\nLocke, Berkeley, Hume, Mill.  Herbert Spencer represents a confluence\\r\\nof the streams.  The spirit of his doctrine is predominantly British;\\r\\nbut he got his \"Unknowable\" from Kant, through Hamilton and Mansel.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any point in a given stream there may be a division.  Thus, Kant was\\r\\nawakened to his creative effort by Hume.  But Mill is also the\\r\\nsuccessor of Hume, and more truly the successor, for he carries on the\\r\\ntraditional way of approaching philosophical problems, while Kant\\r\\nrebels against it, and heads a new line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XXIV, sections 88-93.  I hardly think it is necessary for me to\\r\\ncomment upon this chapter.  The recommendations amount to this: that a\\r\\nman should be fair-minded and reasonable, free from partisanship,\\r\\ncautious, and able to suspend judgment where the evidence is not clear;\\r\\nalso that where the light of reason does not seem to him to shine\\r\\nbrightly and to illumine his path as he could wish, he should be\\r\\ninfluenced in his actions by the reflection that he has his place in\\r\\nthe social order, and must meet the obligations laid upon him by this\\r\\nfact.  When the pragmatist emphasizes the necessity of accepting ideals\\r\\nand living by them, he is doing us a service.  But we must see to it\\r\\nthat he does not lead us into making arbitrary decisions and feeling\\r\\nthat we are released from the duty of seeking for evidence.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.

Selecting his cut and uncut jewels from very various\\r\\nBuddhistic sources, Mr. Bowden has here supplied those who buy and use\\r\\nthe book with rubies and sapphires and emeralds of wisdom, compassion,\\r\\nand human brotherhood, any one of which, worn on the heart, would be\\r\\nsufficient to make the wearer rich beyond estimation for a day. The\\r\\nauthor disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic\\r\\nmorality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be\\r\\npossible within such narrow limits; but I rejoice to observe how well\\r\\nand faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India\\r\\nand the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great\\r\\nAsiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This\\r\\ncompassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by\\r\\nthe collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to\\r\\nemploy; but many another lofty tenet of the \"Light\" of Asia finds\\r\\nillumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by;\\r\\nand he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple\\r\\npages must become, I think, a better man at the year\\'s end than at\\r\\nits beginning. I recommend this compilation without hesitation or\\r\\nreserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDWIN ARNOLD.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCOMPILER\\'S PROEM.\\r\\n\\r\\nE. M. BOWDEN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this compilation no attempt has been made to present a general view\\r\\nof Buddhism as a religious or philosophical system. The aim has rather\\r\\nbeen to turn Buddhism to account as a moral force by bringing together\\r\\na selection of its beautiful sentiments, and lofty maxims, and\\r\\nparticularly including some of those which inculcate mercy to the\\r\\nlower animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this point a far higher stand is taken by Buddhism than by\\r\\nChristianity--or at any rate than by Christianity as understood and\\r\\ninterpreted by those who ought to know. Not only is the whole question\\r\\nof our duties to the lower animals commonly ignored in Christian works\\r\\nas, for instance, in the famous Imitation of Christ, and scores of\\r\\nothers; but, as if this were not enough, a reasoned attempt has\\r\\nactually been made, on the strength of Christian teaching, to explode\\r\\nthe notion that animals have any right (e.g., in Moral Philosophy, by\\r\\nFather Joseph Rickaby). Very different in this respect is the tone of\\r\\nthe average Buddhist treatise, with its earnest exhortations,\\r\\nrecurring as a matter of course, to show mercy on every living thing;\\r\\nand this difference alone is an adequate reason for compiling a\\r\\nBuddhist anthology.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regard to the sources quoted from, considerable latitude seemed\\r\\nallowable. They do not all, by any means, possess canonical authority.\\r\\nBut they are all distinctly Buddhist in character. The supposed dates\\r\\nof the originals range from at least the third century B. C. to\\r\\nmedieval and later times.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, it is clear that, should any one think to make use of\\r\\nquotations from this work for controversial purposes, a certain degree\\r\\nof caution will be necessary. The context of the passage, and the date\\r\\nand the authorship of the original work, may all need to be taken into\\r\\naccount; while it must also be borne in mind that the religious terms,\\r\\nsuch as \"heaven\" and \"sin,\" which have to be employed in English, do\\r\\nnot always correspond exactly to the Buddhist conception.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the numerous Buddhist works which have now been translated from\\r\\nsome eight or ten eastern languages, the greater number, when regarded\\r\\npurely as literature, occupy a very low level. At times they are so\\r\\nremarkably dull and silly that the reader is inclined to ask why they\\r\\nwere ever translated. But the one redeeming feature in the voluminous\\r\\ncompositions of Buddhist writers is the boundless compassion which\\r\\nthey consistently inculcate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe insertion of a passage in these pages does not necessarily imply\\r\\nthat the compiler accepts in its entirety the teaching it conveys.\\r\\nConcerning that oft-repeated injunction, not to kill any living\\r\\ncreature whatsoever, we can hardly doubt that there are many cases in\\r\\nwhich to take life, provided it is taken painlessly, not only is not\\r\\non the whole an unkindness, but is an act of beneficence. If we\\r\\nsometimes give to this injunction the sense of extending our sympathy\\r\\nto the lowest sentient being, and not causing pain to living creatures\\r\\nwhile they live, we shall perhaps not be doing violence to the spirit\\r\\nof mercy by which it was prompted. There are many passages in Buddhist\\r\\nworks which advocate preference for the spirit over the letter, or the\\r\\nexercise of judgment in accepting what we are taught.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few passages, though not many, have been included more because they\\r\\nare striking or poetical than for the sake of their moral teaching.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the references given are mostly to the Oriental origins, it is only\\r\\nfair to insert here a list of the English and French translations\\r\\nwhich have been principally used in compiling this book. The following\\r\\nworks comprise most of those which have proved directly of service for\\r\\nthe purpose--\"Sacred Books of the East,\" namely:\\r\\n\\r\\n     Vol. 10. Dhammapada, by F.

It affords an adequate idea of the march of facts and of\\r\\nideas.

It aims above all at being _a\\r\\nframe_ in which can conveniently be inscribed, in the course of further\\r\\nstudies, new conceptions more detailed and more thoroughly examined.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will have fulfilled its design should it incite to research and\\r\\nmeditation, and if it prepares for them correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nE.

That is why, taking \"principle\" in all the senses\\r\\nof the word, it has been called the science of first principles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy has always existed. Religions--all religions--are\\r\\nphilosophies. They are indeed the most complete. But, apart from religions,\\r\\nmen have sought the causes and principles of everything and endeavoured to\\r\\nacquire general ideas. These researches apart from religious dogmas in\\r\\npagan antiquity are the only ones with which we are here to be concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE IONIAN SCHOOL: THALES.--The Ionian School is the most ancient\\r\\nschool of philosophy known. It dates back to the seventh century before\\r\\nChrist. Thales of Miletus, a natural philosopher and astronomer, as we\\r\\nshould describe him, believed matter--namely, that of which all things and\\r\\nall beings are made--to be in perpetual transformation, and that these\\r\\ntransformations are produced by powerful beings attached to every portion\\r\\nof matter. These powerful beings were gods. Everything, therefore, was full\\r\\nof gods. His philosophy was a mythology. He also thought that the\\r\\nessential element of matter was water, and that it was water, under the\\r\\ninfluence of the gods, which transformed itself into earth, air, and fire,\\r\\nwhilst from water, earth, air, and fire came everything that is in nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nANAXIMANDER; HERACLITUS.--Anaximander of Miletus, an astronomer\\r\\nalso, and a geographer, believed that the principle of all things is\\r\\n_indeterminate_--a kind of chaos wherein nothing has form or shape;\\r\\nthat from chaos come things and beings, and that they return thither in\\r\\norder to emerge again. One of his particular theories was that fish were\\r\\nthe most ancient of animals, and that all animals had issued from them\\r\\nthrough successive transformations. This theory was revived for a while\\r\\nabout fifty years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeraclitus of Ephesus (very obscure, and with this epithet attached\\r\\npermanently to his name) saw all things as a perpetual growth--in an\\r\\nindefinite state of becoming. Nothing is; all things grow and are destined\\r\\nto eternal growth. Behind them, nevertheless, there is an eternal master\\r\\nwho does not change. It is our duty to resemble him as much as we can; that\\r\\nis to say, as much as an ape can resemble a man. Calmness is imperative: to\\r\\nbe as motionless as transient beings can. The popular legend runs that\\r\\nHeraclitus \"always wept\"; what is known of him only tends to prove that he\\r\\nwas grave, and did not favour emotionalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nANAXAGORAS; EMPEDOCLES.--Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, above all else a\\r\\nnatural philosopher, settled at Athens about 470 B.C.; was the master and\\r\\nfriend of Pericles; was on the point of being put to death, as Socrates was\\r\\nlater on, for the crime of indifference towards the religion of the\\r\\nAthenians, and had to take refuge at Lampsacus, where he died. Like\\r\\nAnaximander, he believed that everything emerged from something\\r\\nindeterminate and confused; but he added that what caused the emergence\\r\\nfrom that state was the organizing intelligence, the Mind, just as in man,\\r\\nit is the intelligence which draws thought from cerebral undulations, and\\r\\nforms a clear idea out of a confused idea. Anaxagoras exerted an almost\\r\\nincomparable influence over Greek philosophy of the classical times.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpedocles of Agrigentum, a sort of magician and high-priest, almost a\\r\\ndeity, whose life and death are but little known, appears to have possessed\\r\\nan encyclopaedic brain. From him is derived the doctrine of the four\\r\\nelements, for whereas the philosophers who preceded him gave as the sole\\r\\nsource of things--some water, others air, others fire, others the earth, he\\r\\nregarded them all four equally as the primal elements of everything. He\\r\\nbelieved that the world is swayed by two contrary forces--love and hate,\\r\\nthe one desiring eternally to unite, the other eternally to\\r\\ndisintegrate. Amid this struggle goes on a movement of organization,\\r\\nincessantly retarded by hate, perpetually facilitated by love; and from\\r\\nthis movement have issued--first, vegetation, then the lower animals, then\\r\\nthe higher animals, then men. In Empedocles can be found either evident\\r\\ntraces of the religion of Zoroaster of Persia (the perpetual antagonism of\\r\\ntwo great gods, that of good and that of evil), or else a curious\\r\\ncoincidence with this doctrine, which will appear again later among the\\r\\nManicheans.\\r\\n\\r\\nPYTHAGORAS.--Pythagoras appears to have been born about B.C. 500 on\\r\\nthe Isle of Elea, to have travelled much, and to have finally settled in\\r\\nGreater Greece (southern Italy). Pythagoras, like Empedocles, was a sort\\r\\nof magician or god. His doctrine was a religion, the respect with which he\\r\\nwas surrounded was a cult, the observances he imposed on his family and on\\r\\nhis disciples were rites. What he taught was that the true realities, which\\r\\ndo not change, were numbers. The fundamental and supreme reality is\\r\\n_one_; the being who is one is God; from this number, which is one,\\r\\nare derived all the other numbers which are the foundation of beings, their\\r\\ninward cause, their essence; we are all more or less perfect numbers; each\\r\\ncreated thing is a more or less perfect number. The world, governed thus by\\r\\ncombinations of numbers, has always existed and will always exist. It\\r\\ndevelops itself, however, according to a numerical series of which we do\\r\\nnot possess the key, but which we can guess. As for human destiny it is\\r\\nthis: we have been animated beings, human or animal; according as we have\\r\\nlived well or ill we shall be reincarnated either as superior men or as\\r\\nanimals more or less inferior. This is the doctrine of _metempsychosis_,\\r\\nwhich had many adherents in ancient days, and also in a more or less\\r\\nfanciful fashion in modern times.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo Pythagoras have been attributed a certain number of maxims which are\\r\\ncalled the _Golden Verses_.\\r\\n\\r\\nXENOPHANES; PARMENIDES.--Xenophanes of Colophon is also a\\r\\n\"unitarian.\" He accepts only one God, and of all the ancient philosophers\\r\\nappears to be the most opposed to mythology, to belief in a multiplicity of\\r\\ngods resembling men, a doctrine which he despises as being immoral. There\\r\\nis one God, eternal, immutable, immovable, who has no need to transfer\\r\\nHimself from one locality to another, who is _without place_, and who\\r\\ngoverns all things by His thought alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvancing further, Parmenides told himself that if He alone really exists\\r\\nwho is one and eternal and unchangeable, all else is not only inferior to\\r\\nHim, but is only a _semblance_, and that mankind, earth, sky, plants,\\r\\nand animals are only a vast illusion--phantoms, a mirage, which would\\r\\ndisappear, which would no longer exist, and _would never have existed_\\r\\nif we could perceive the Self-existent.\\r\\n\\r\\nZENO; DEMOCRITUS.--Zeno of Elea, who must be mentioned more\\r\\nespecially because he was the master of that Gorgias of whom Socrates was\\r\\nthe adversary, was pre-eminently a subtle dialectician in whom the sophist\\r\\nalready made his appearance, and who embarrassed the Athenians by captious\\r\\narguments, at the bottom of which always could be found this fundamental\\r\\nprinciple: apart from the Eternal Being all is only semblance; apart from\\r\\nHim who is all, all is nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocritus of Abdera, disciple of Leucippus of Abdera (about whom nothing\\r\\nis known), is the inventor of the theory of atoms. Matter is composed of an\\r\\ninfinite number of tiny indivisible bodies which are called atoms; these\\r\\natoms from all eternity, or at least since the commencement of matter, have\\r\\nbeen endued with certain movements by which they attach themselves to one\\r\\nanother, and agglomerate or separate, and thence is caused the formation of\\r\\nall things, and the destruction, which is only the disintegration, of all\\r\\nthings. The soul itself is only an aggregation of specially tenuous and\\r\\nsubtle atoms. It is probable that when a certain number of these atoms quit\\r\\nthe body, sleep ensues; that when nearly all depart, it causes the\\r\\nappearance of death (lethargy, catalepsy); that when they all depart, death\\r\\noccurs. We are brought into relation with the external world by the advent\\r\\nin us of extremely subtle atoms--reflections of things, semblances of\\r\\nthings--which enter and mingle with the constituent atoms of our\\r\\nsouls. There is nothing in our intelligence which has not been brought\\r\\nthere by our senses, and our intelligence is only the combination of the\\r\\natoms composing our souls with the atoms that external matter sends, so to\\r\\nspeak, into our souls. The doctrines of Democritus will be found again in\\r\\nthose of Epicurus and Lucretius.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SOPHISTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLogicians and Professors of Logic, and of the Analysis of\\r\\nIdeas, and of Discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTRINES OF THE SOPHISTS.--The Sophists descend from Parmenides and\\r\\nZeno of Elea; Gorgias was the disciple of the latter. By dint of thinking\\r\\nthat all is semblance save the Supreme Being, who alone is real, it is very\\r\\neasy to arrive at belief in all being semblance, including that Being; or\\r\\nat least what is almost tantamount, that all is semblance, inclusive of any\\r\\nidea we can possibly conceive of the Supreme Being. To believe nothing, and\\r\\nto demonstrate that there is no reason to believe in anything, is the\\r\\ncardinal principle of all the Sophists. Then, it may be suggested, there is\\r\\nnothing for it but to be silent. No, there is the cultivation of one\\'s\\r\\nmind (the only thing of the existence of which we are sure), so as to give\\r\\nit ability, readiness, and strength. With what object? To become a\\r\\ndexterous thinker, which in itself is a fine thing; to be also a man of\\r\\nconsideration, listened to in one\\'s city, and to arrive at its government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sophists accordingly gave lessons, especially in psychology,\\r\\ndialectics, and eloquence. They further taught philosophy, but in order to\\r\\ndemonstrate that all philosophy is false; and, as Pascal observed later,\\r\\nthat to ridicule philosophy is truly philosophical. They seem to have been\\r\\nextremely intellectual, very learned, and most serious despite their\\r\\nscepticism, and to have rendered Greece the very great service of making a\\r\\npenetrating analysis--the first recorded--of our faculty of knowledge and\\r\\nof the limitations, real, possible, or probable, of that faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nPROTAGORAS; GORGIAS; PRODICUS.--They were very numerous, the taste\\r\\nfor their art, which might be called philosophical criticism, being\\r\\nwidespread in Attica. It may be believed, as Plato maintains, that some\\r\\nwere of very mediocre capacity, and this is natural; but there were also\\r\\nsome who clearly were eminent authorities. The most illustrious were\\r\\nProtagoras, Gorgias, and Prodicus of Ceos. Protagoras seems to have been\\r\\nthe most philosophical of them all, Gorgias the best orator and the chief\\r\\nprofessor of rhetoric, Prodicus the most eminent moralist and poet.\\r\\nProtagoras rejected all metaphysics--that is, all investigation of first\\r\\ncauses and of the universe--and reduced all philosophy to the science of\\r\\nself-control with a view to happiness, and control of others with a view to\\r\\ntheir happiness. Like Anaxagoras, he was banished from the city under the\\r\\ncharge of impiety, and his books were publicly burnt.\\r\\n\\r\\nGorgias appears to have maintained the same ideas with more moderation and\\r\\nalso with less profundity. He claimed, above all, to be able to make a good\\r\\norator. According to Plato, it was he whom Socrates most persistently made\\r\\nthe butt of his sarcasms.\\r\\n\\r\\nProdicus, whom Plato himself esteemed, appears to have been principally\\r\\npreoccupied with the moral problem. He was the author of the famous\\r\\napologue which represented Hercules having to choose between two paths, the\\r\\none being that of virtue, the other of pleasure. Like Socrates later on, he\\r\\ntoo was subject to the terrible accusation of impiety, and underwent\\r\\ncapital punishment. The Sophists furnish the most important epoch in the\\r\\nhistory of ancient philosophy; until their advent the philosophic systems\\r\\nwere great poems on the total of all things, known and unknown. The\\r\\nSophists opposed these ambitious and precipitate generalizations, in which\\r\\nimagination had the larger share, and their discovery was to bring\\r\\nphilosophy back to its true starting point by affirming that the first\\r\\nthing to do, and that before all else, was to know our own mind and its\\r\\nmechanism. Their error possibly was, while saying that it was the first\\r\\nthing to do, too often to affirm that it was the only thing to do; still\\r\\nthe fact remains that they were perfectly accurate in their assurance that\\r\\nit was primary.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nSOCRATES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy Entirely Reduced to Morality, and Morality\\r\\nConsidered as the End of all Intellectual Activity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCRATES.--Of Socrates nothing is known except\\r\\nthat he was born at Athens, that he held many public discussions with all\\r\\nand sundry in the streets of Athens, and that he died under the Thirty\\r\\nTyrants. Of his ideas we know nothing, because he wrote nothing, and\\r\\nbecause his disciples were far too intelligent; in consequence of which it\\r\\nis impossible to know if what they said was thought by him, had really been\\r\\nhis ideas or theirs. What seems certain is that neither Aristophanes nor\\r\\nthe judges at the trial of Socrates were completely deceived in considering\\r\\nhim a Sophist; for he proceeded from them. It is true he proceeded from\\r\\nthem by reaction, because evidently their universal scepticism had\\r\\nterrified him; but nevertheless he was their direct outcome, for like them\\r\\nhe was extremely mistrustful of the old vast systems of philosophy, and to\\r\\nthose men who pretended to know everything he opposed a phrase which is\\r\\nprobably authentic: \"I know that I know nothing;\" for, like the Sophists,\\r\\nhe wished to recall philosophy to earth from heaven, namely from\\r\\nmetaphysics to the study of man, and nothing else; for, like the Sophists,\\r\\nhe confined and limited the field with a kind of severe and imperious\\r\\nmodesty which was none the less contemptuous of the audacious; for,\\r\\nfinally, like the Sophists, but in this highly analogous to many\\r\\nphilosophers preceding the Sophists, he had but a very moderate and\\r\\nmitigated respect for the religion of his fellow-citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to what we know of Socrates from Xenophon, unquestionably the\\r\\nleast imaginative of his disciples, Socrates, like the Sophists, reduced\\r\\nphilosophy to the study of man; but his great and incomparable originality\\r\\nlay in the fact that whereas the Sophists wished man to study himself in\\r\\norder to be happy, Socrates wished him to study himself in order to be\\r\\nmoral, honest, and just, without any regard to happiness. For Socrates,\\r\\neverything had to tend towards morality, to contribute to it, and to be\\r\\nsubordinated to it as the goal and as the final aim. He applied himself\\r\\nunceasingly, relates Xenophon, to examine and to determine what is good and\\r\\nevil, just and unjust, wise and foolish, brave and cowardly, etc. He\\r\\nincessantly applied himself, relates Aristotle--and therein he was as much\\r\\na true professor of rhetoric as of morality--thoroughly to define and\\r\\ncarefully to specify the meaning of words in order not to be put off with\\r\\nvague terms which are illusions of thought, and in order to discipline his\\r\\nmind rigorously so as to make it an organ for the ascertainment of truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS METHOD.--He had dialectical methods, \"the art of conferring,\" as\\r\\nMontaigne called it, more or less happy, which he had probably borrowed\\r\\nfrom the Sophists, that contributed to cause him to be considered one of\\r\\nthem, and exercised a wide vogue long after him. He \"delivered men\\'s\\r\\nminds,\" as he himself said--that is, he believed, or affected to believe,\\r\\nthat the verities are in a latent state in all minds, and that it needed\\r\\nonly patience, dexterity, and skillful investigation to bring them to\\r\\nlight. Elsewhere, he _interrogated_ in a captious fashion in order to\\r\\nset the interlocutor in contradiction to himself and to make him confess\\r\\nthat he had said what he had not thought he had said, agreed to what he had\\r\\nnot believed he had agreed to; and he triumphed maliciously over such\\r\\nconfusions. In short, he seems to have been a witty and teasing Franklin,\\r\\nand to have taught true wisdom by laughing at everyone. Folk never like to\\r\\nbe ridiculed, and no doubt the recollection of these ironies had much to do\\r\\nwith the iniquitous judgment which condemned him, and which he seems to\\r\\nhave challenged up to the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS INFLUENCE.--His influence was infinite. It is from him that\\r\\nmorality became the end itself, the last and supreme end of all\\r\\nphilosophy--the reason of philosophy; and, as was observed by Nietzsche,\\r\\nthe Circe of philosophers, who enchants them, who dictates to them\\r\\nbeforehand, or who modifies their systems in advance by terrifying them as\\r\\nto what their systems may contain irreverent towards itself or dangerous in\\r\\nrelation to it. From Socrates to Kant and thence onward, morality has been\\r\\nthe Circe of philosophers, and morality is, as it were, the spiritual\\r\\ndaughter of Socrates. On the other hand, his influence was terrible for the\\r\\nreligion of antiquity because it directed the mind towards the idea that\\r\\nmorality is the sole object worthy of knowledge, and that the ancient\\r\\nreligions were immoral, or of such a dubious morality as to deserve the\\r\\ndesertion and scorn of honest men. Christianity fought paganism with the\\r\\narguments of the disciples of Socrates--with Socratic arguments; modern\\r\\nphilosophies and creeds are all impregnated with Socraticism. When it was\\r\\nobserved that the Sophists form the most important epoch in the history of\\r\\nancient philosophy, it was because they taught Socrates to seek a\\r\\nphilosophy which was entirely human and preoccupied solely with the\\r\\nhappiness of man. This led a great mind, and in his track other very great\\r\\nminds, to direct all philosophy, and even all human science, towards the\\r\\ninvestigation of goodness, goodness being regarded as the condition of\\r\\nhappiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nPLATO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlato, like Socrates, is Pre-eminently a Moralist,\\r\\nbut he reverts to General Consideration of the Universe\\r\\nand Deals with Politics and Legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPLATO A DISCIPLE OF SOCRATES.--Plato, like Xenophon, was a pupil of\\r\\nSocrates, but Xenophon only wanted to be the clerk of Socrates; and Plato,\\r\\nas an enthusiastic disciple, was at the same time very faithful and very\\r\\nunfaithful to Socrates. He was a faithful disciple to Socrates in never\\r\\nfailing to place morality in the foremost rank of all philosophical\\r\\nconsiderations; in that he never varied. He was an unfaithful disciple to\\r\\nSocrates in that, imaginative and an admirable poet, he bore back\\r\\nphilosophy from earth to heaven; he did not forbid himself--quite the\\r\\ncontrary--to pile up great systems about all things and to envelop the\\r\\nuniverse in his vast and daring conceptions. He invincibly established\\r\\nmorality, the science of virtue, as the final goal of human knowledge, in\\r\\nhis brilliant and charming _Socratic Dialogues_; he formed great\\r\\nsystems in all the works in which he introduces himself as speaking in his\\r\\nown name. He was very learned, and acquainted with everything that had been\\r\\nwritten by all the philosophers before Socrates, particularly Heraclitus,\\r\\nPythagoras, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras. He reconsidered all their teaching,\\r\\nand he himself brought to consideration a force and a wealth of mind such\\r\\nas appear to have had no parallel in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE \"IDEAS.\"--Seeking, in his turn, what are the first causes of all\\r\\nand what is eternally real behind the simulations of this transient world,\\r\\nhe believed in a single God, as had many before him; but in the bosom of\\r\\nthis God, so to speak, he placed, he seemed to see, _Ideas_--that is\\r\\nto say, eternal types of all things which in this world are variable,\\r\\ntransient, and perishable. What he effected by such novel, original, and\\r\\npowerful imagination is clear. He replaced the Olympus of the populace by a\\r\\nspiritual Olympus; the material mythology by an idealistic mythology;\\r\\npolytheism by polyideism, if it may be so expressed--the gods by\\r\\ntypes. Behind every phenomenon, stream, forest, mountain, the Greeks\\r\\nperceived a deity, a material being like themselves, more powerful than\\r\\nthemselves. Behind every phenomenon, behind every thought as well, every\\r\\nfeeling, every institution--behind _everything, no matter what it be_,\\r\\nPlato perceived an idea, immortal, eternal, indestructible, and\\r\\nincorruptible, which existed in the bosom of the Eternal, and of which all\\r\\nthat comes under our observation is only the vacillating and troubled\\r\\nreflection, and which supports, animates, and for a time preserves\\r\\neverything that we can perceive. Hence, all philosophy consists in having\\r\\nsome knowledge of these Ideas. How is it possible to attain such knowledge?\\r\\nBy raising the mind from the particular to the general; by distinguishing\\r\\nin each thing what is its permanent foundation, what it contains that is\\r\\nleast changing, least variable, least circumstantial. For example, a man is\\r\\na very complex being; he has countless feelings, countless diversified\\r\\nideas, countless methods of conduct and existence. What is his permanent\\r\\nfoundation? It is his conscience, which does not vary, undergoes no\\r\\ntransformation, always obstinately repeats the same thing; the foundation\\r\\nof man, the eternal idea of which every man on earth is here the\\r\\nreflection, is the consciousness of good; man is an incarnation on earth of\\r\\nthat part of God which is the will for good; according as he diverges from\\r\\nor approaches more nearly to this will, is he less or more man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PLATONIC DIALECTIC AND MORALITY.--This method of raising oneself\\r\\nto the ideas is what Plato termed dialectic--that is to say, the art of\\r\\ndiscernment. Dialectic differentiates between the fundamental and the\\r\\nsuperficial, the permanent and the transient, the indestructible and the\\r\\ndestructible. This is the supreme philosophic method which contains all the\\r\\nothers and to which all the others are reduced. Upon this metaphysic and by\\r\\nthe aid of this dialectic, Plato constructed an extremely pure system of\\r\\nmorality which was simply an _Imitation of God_ (as, later on, came\\r\\nthe Imitation of Jesus Christ). The whole duty of man was to be as like\\r\\nGod as he could. In God exist the ideas of truth, goodness, beauty,\\r\\ngreatness, power, etc.; man ought to aim at relatively realizing those\\r\\nideas which God absolutely realizes. God is just, or justice lies in the\\r\\nbosom of God, which is the same thing; man cannot be the just one, but he\\r\\ncan be a just man, and there is the whole matter; for justice comprises\\r\\neverything, or, to express it differently, is the characteristic common to\\r\\nall which is valuable. Justice is goodness, justice is beautiful, justice\\r\\nis true; justice is great, because it reduces all particular cases to one\\r\\ngeneral principle; justice is powerful, being the force which maintains,\\r\\nopposed to the force which destroys; justice is eternal and invariable. To\\r\\nbe just in all the meanings of the word is the duty of man and his proper\\r\\ngoal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL.--Plato shows marked reserve as to the\\r\\nimmortality of the soul and as to rewards and penalties beyond the\\r\\ngrave. He is neither in opposition nor formally favourable. We feel that he\\r\\nwishes to believe in it rather than that he is sure about it. He says that\\r\\n\"it is a fine wager to make\"; which means that even should we lose, it is\\r\\nbetter to believe in this possible gain than to disbelieve. Further, it is\\r\\nlegitimate to conclude--both from certain passages in the _Laws_ and\\r\\nfrom the beautiful theory of Plato on the punishment which is an expiation,\\r\\nand on the expiation which is medicinal to the soul and consequently highly\\r\\ndesirable--that Plato often inclined strongly towards the doctrine of\\r\\nposthumous penalties and rewards, which presupposes the immortality of the\\r\\nsoul.\\r\\n\\r\\nPLATONIC LOVE.--Platonic love, about which there has been so much\\r\\ntalk and on which, consequently, we must say a word, at least to define it,\\r\\nis one of the applications of his moral system. As in the case of all other\\r\\nthings, the idea of love is in God. There it exists in absolute purity,\\r\\nwithout any mixture of the idea of pleasure, since pleasure is essentially\\r\\nephemeral and perishable. Love in God consists simply in the impassioned\\r\\ncontemplation of beauty (physical and moral); we shall resemble God if we\\r\\nlove beauty precisely in this way, without excitement or agitation of the\\r\\nsenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nPOLITICS.--One of the originalities in Plato is that he busies\\r\\nhimself with politics--that is, that he makes politics a part of\\r\\nphilosophy, which had barely been thought of before him (I say\\r\\n_barely_, because Pythagoras was a legislator), but which has ever\\r\\nsince been taken into consideration. Plato is aristocratic, no doubt\\r\\nbecause his thought is generally such, independently of circumstances,\\r\\nalso, perhaps, because he attributed the great misfortunes of his country\\r\\nwhich he witnessed to the Athenian democracy; then yet again, perhaps,\\r\\nbecause that Athenian democracy had been violently hostile and sometimes\\r\\ncruel to philosophers, and more especially to his own master. According to\\r\\nPlato, just as man has three souls, or if it be preferred, three centres of\\r\\nactivity, which govern him--intelligence in the head, courage in the heart,\\r\\nand appetite in the bowels--even so the city is composed of three classes:\\r\\nwise and learned men at the top, the warriors below, and the artisans and\\r\\nslaves lower still. The wise men will govern: accordingly the nations will\\r\\nnever be happy save when philosophers are kings, or when kings are\\r\\nphilosophers. The warriors will fight to defend the city, never as\\r\\naggressors. They will form a caste--poor, stern to itself, and\\r\\nredoubtable. They will have no individual possessions; everything will be\\r\\nin common, houses, furniture, weapons, wives even, and children. The\\r\\npeople, finally, living in strict equality, either by equal partition of\\r\\nland, or on land cultivated in common, will be strictly maintained in\\r\\nprobity, honesty, austerity, morality, sobriety, and submissiveness. All\\r\\narts, except military music and war dances, will be eliminated from the\\r\\ncity. She needs neither poets nor painters not yet musicians, who corrupt\\r\\nmorals by softening them, and by making all feel the secret pang of\\r\\nvoluptuousness. All theories, whether aristocratic or tending more or less\\r\\nto communism, are derived from the politics of Plato either by being\\r\\nevolved from them or by harking back to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MASTER OF THE IDEALISTIC PHILOSOPHY.--Plato is for all thinkers,\\r\\neven for his opponents, the greatest name in human philosophy. He is the\\r\\nsupreme authority of the idealistic philosophy--that is, of all philosophy\\r\\nwhich believes that ideas govern the world, and that the world is\\r\\nprogressing towards a perfection which is somewhere and which directs and\\r\\nattracts it. For those even who are not of his school, Plato is the most\\r\\nprodigious of all the thinkers who have united psychological wisdom,\\r\\ndialectical strength, the power of abstraction and creative imagination,\\r\\nwhich last in him attains to the marvellous.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nARISTOTLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Man of Encyclopedic Learning; as Philosopher,\\r\\nmore especially Moralist and Logician.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nARISTOTLE, PUPIL OF PLATO.--Aristotle of Stagira was a pupil of\\r\\nPlato, and he remembered it, as the best pupils do as a rule, in order to\\r\\noppose him. For some years he was tutor to Alexander, son of Philip, the\\r\\nfuture Alexander the Great. He taught long at Athens. After the death of\\r\\nAlexander, being the target in his turn of the eternal accusation of\\r\\nimpiety, he was forced to retire to Chalcis, where he died. Aristotle is,\\r\\nbefore all else, a learned man. He desired to embrace the whole of the\\r\\nknowledge of his time, which was then possible by dint of prodigious\\r\\neffort, and he succeeded. His works, countless in number, are the record of\\r\\nhis knowledge. They are the _summa_ of all the sciences of his\\r\\nepoch. Here we have only to occupy ourselves with his more especially\\r\\nphilosophical ideas. To Aristotle, as to Plato, but more precisely, man is\\r\\ncomposed of soul and body. The body is composed of organs, a well-made\\r\\npiece of mechanism; the soul is its final purpose; the body, so to speak,\\r\\nresults in the soul, but, in turn, the soul acts on the body, and is in it\\r\\nnot its end but its means of acting upon things, and the whole forms a full\\r\\nand continuous harmony. The faculties of the soul are its divers aspects,\\r\\nand its divers methods of acting; for the soul is one and\\r\\nindivisible. Reason is the soul considered as being able to conceive what\\r\\nis most general, and in consequence it forms within us an intermediary\\r\\nbetween ourselves and God. God is unique; He is eternal; from all eternity\\r\\nHe has given motion to matter. He is purely spiritual, but all is material\\r\\nsave Him, and He has not, as Plato would have it, _ideas_--immaterial\\r\\nliving personifications--residing in His bosom. Here may be perceived, in a\\r\\ncertain sense, progress, from Plato to Aristotle, towards monotheism; the\\r\\nOlympus of ideas in Plato was still a polytheism, a spiritual polytheism\\r\\ncertainly, yet none the less a polytheism; there is no longer any\\r\\npolytheism at all in Aristotle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS THEORIES OF MORALS AND POLITICS.--The moral system of Aristotle\\r\\nsometimes approaches that of Plato, as when he deems that the supreme\\r\\nhappiness is the supreme good, and that the supreme good is the\\r\\ncontemplation of thought by thought--thought being self-sufficing; which is\\r\\napproximately the imitation of God which Plato recommended. Sometimes, on\\r\\nthe contrary, it is very practical and almost mediocre, as when he makes it\\r\\nconsist of a mean between the extremes, a just measure, a certain tact, art\\r\\nrather than science, and practical science rather than conscience, which\\r\\nwill know how to distinguish which are the practices suitable for an honest\\r\\nand a well-born man. It is only just to add that in detail and when after\\r\\nall deductions he describes the just man, he invites us to contemplate\\r\\nvirtues which if not sublime are none the less remarkably lofty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis very confused political philosophy (the volume containing it, according\\r\\nto all appearance, having been composed, after his death, of passages and\\r\\nfragments and different portions of his lectures) is specially a review of\\r\\nthe divergent political constitutions which existed throughout the Greek\\r\\nworld. The tendencies, for there are no conclusions, are still very\\r\\naristocratic, but less radically aristocratic than those of Plato.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE AUTHORITY OF ARISTOTLE.--Aristotle, by reason of his\\r\\nuniversality, also because he is clearer than his master, and again because\\r\\nhe dogmatises--not always, but very frequently--instead of discussing and\\r\\ncollating, had throughout both antiquity and the Middle Ages an authority\\r\\ngreater than that of Plato, an authority which became (except on matters of\\r\\nfaith) despotic and well-nigh sacrosanct. Since the sixteenth century he\\r\\nhas been relegated to his due rank--one which is still very distinguished,\\r\\nand he has been regarded as among the geniuses of the widest range, if not\\r\\nof the greatest power, that have appeared among men; even now he is very\\r\\nfar from having lost his importance. For some he is a transition between\\r\\nthe Greek genius--extremely subtle, but always poetic and always somewhat\\r\\noriental--and the Roman genius: more positive, more bald, more practical,\\r\\nmore attached to reality and to pure science.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nVARIOUS SCHOOLS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Development in Various Schools of the General Ideas\\r\\nof Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCHOOL OF PLATO; THEOPHRASTUS.--The school of Plato (not\\r\\nregarding Aristotle as belonging entirely to that school) was continued by\\r\\nSpeusippus, Polemo, Xenocrates, Crates, and Crantor. Owing to a retrograde\\r\\nmovement, widely different from that of Aristotle, it dabbled in the\\r\\nPythagorean ideas, with which Plato was acquainted and which he often\\r\\nappreciated, but not blindly, and to which he never confined himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most brilliant pupil of Aristotle was Theophrastus, naturalist,\\r\\nbotanist, and moralist. His great claim to fame among posterity, which\\r\\nknows nothing of him but this, is the small volume of _Characters_,\\r\\nwhich served as a model for La Bruy\\xc3\\xa8re, and before him to the comic poets\\r\\nof antiquity, and which is full of wit and flavour, and--to make use of a\\r\\nmodern word exactly applicable to this ancient work--\"humour.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHOOLS OF MEGARA AND OF ELIS.--We may just mention the very\\r\\ncelebrated schools which, owing to lack of texts, are unknown to us--that\\r\\nof Megara, which was called the Eristic or \"wrangling\" school, so marked\\r\\nwas its predilection for polemics; and that of Elis, which appears to have\\r\\nbeen well versed in the sophistic methods of Zeno of Elea and of Gorgias.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CYNIC SCHOOL; ANTISTHENES; DIOGENES.--Much more important is the\\r\\nCynic school, because a school, which was nothing less than Stoicism\\r\\nitself, emanated or appeared to emanate from it. As often happens, the\\r\\nvague commencements of Stoicism bore a close resemblance to its end. The\\r\\nStoics of the last centuries of antiquity were a sort of mendicant friars,\\r\\nill-clothed, ill-fed, of neglected appearance, despising all the comforts\\r\\nof life; the Cynics at the time of Alexander were much the same, professing\\r\\nthat happiness is the possession of all good things, and that the only way\\r\\nto possess all things is to know how to do without them. It was\\r\\nAntisthenes who founded this school, or rather this order. He had been the\\r\\npupil of Socrates, and there can be no doubt that his sole idea was to\\r\\nimitate Socrates by exaggeration. Socrates had been poor, had scorned\\r\\nwealth, had derided pleasure, and poured contempt on science. The cult of\\r\\npoverty, the contempt for pleasures, for honours, for riches, and the\\r\\nperfect conviction that any knowledge is perfectly useless to man--that is\\r\\nall the teaching of Antisthenes. That can lead far, at least in systematic\\r\\nminds. If all is contemptible except individual virtue, it is reversion to\\r\\nsavage and solitary existence which is preached: there is no more\\r\\ncivilization or society or patriotism. Antisthenes in these ideas was\\r\\nsurpassed by his disciples and successors; they were cosmopolitans and\\r\\nanarchists. The most illustrious of this school--illustrious especially\\r\\nthrough his eccentricity--was Diogenes, who rolled on the ramparts of\\r\\nCorinth the tub which served him as a house, lighted his lantern in broad\\r\\ndaylight on the pretext of \"searching for a man,\" called himself a citizen\\r\\nof the world, was accused of being banished from Sinope by his\\r\\nfellow-countrymen and replied, \"It was I who condemned them to remain,\" and\\r\\nsaid to Alexander, who asked him what he could do for him: \"Get out of my\\r\\nsunshine; you are putting me in the shade.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCRATES; MENIPPUS; ARISTIPPUS.--Crates of Thebes is also mentioned,\\r\\nless insolent and better-mannered, yet also a despiser of the goods of this\\r\\nworld; and Menippus, the maker of satires, whom Lucian, much later, made\\r\\nthe most diverting interlocutor of his amusing dialogues. In an opposite\\r\\ndirection, at the same epoch, Aristippus, a pupil of Socrates, like\\r\\nAntisthenes, founded the school of pleasure, and maintained that the sole\\r\\nsearch worthy of man was that of happiness, and that it was his duty to\\r\\nmake himself happy; that in consequence, it having been sufficiently proved\\r\\nand being even self-evident, that happiness cannot come to us from without,\\r\\nbut must be sought within ourselves, it is necessary to study to know\\r\\nourselves thoroughly (and this was from Socrates) in order to decide what\\r\\nare the states of the mind which give us a durable, substantial, and, if\\r\\npossible, a permanent happiness. Now the seeker and the finder of\\r\\nsubstantial happiness is wisdom, or rather, there is no other wisdom than\\r\\nthe art of distinguishing between pleasure and choosing, with a very\\r\\nrefined discrimination, those which are genuine. Wisdom further consists in\\r\\ndominating misfortunes by the mastery of self so as not to be affected by\\r\\nthem, and in dominating also pleasures even whilst enjoying them, so that\\r\\nthey may not obtain dominion over us; \"possessing without being possessed\"\\r\\nwas one of his mottoes which Horace thus translated: \"I strive to subject\\r\\nthings to myself, not myself to things.\" This eminently practical wisdom,\\r\\nwhich is only a highly-developed egoism, is that of Horace and Montaigne,\\r\\nand was expressed by Voltaire in verses that were sometimes felicitous.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCHOOL OF CYRENE.--Aristippus had for successor in the direction\\r\\nof his school, first his daughter Arete, then his grandson. The\\r\\nAristippists, or Cyrenaics (the school being established in Cyrene),\\r\\nfrankly despised the gods, regarding them as inventions to frighten women\\r\\nand little children. One of them, Euhemerus, invented the theory, which in\\r\\npart is false and in part accurate, that the gods are simply heroes, kings,\\r\\ngreat men deified after their death by the gratitude or terror of the\\r\\npopulace. As often happens, philosophic theories being essentially plastic\\r\\nand taking the form of the temperament which receives them, a certain\\r\\nCyrenaic (Hegesias) enunciated the doctrine that the supreme happiness of\\r\\nman was suicide. In fact, if the object of man is happiness, since life\\r\\naffords far fewer joys than sorrows, the philosophy of happiness is to get\\r\\nrid of life, and the sole wisdom lies in suicide. It does not appear that\\r\\nHegesias gave the only proof of sincere belief in this doctrine which can\\r\\nbe given by anyone professing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nEPICUREANISM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEpicureanism Believes that the Duty of Man is to Seek\\r\\nHappiness, and that Happiness Consists in Wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMORAL PHILOSOPHY.--Continuing to feel the strong impulse which it\\r\\nhad received from Socrates, philosophy was now for a long while to be\\r\\nalmost exclusively moral philosophy. Only it divided very sharply in two\\r\\ndirections. Antisthenes and Aristippus were both pupils of Socrates. From\\r\\nAntisthenes came the Cynics; from Aristippus the philosophers of\\r\\npleasure. The Cynics gave birth to the Stoics, the philosophers of pleasure\\r\\nto the Epicureans, and these two great schools practically divided all\\r\\nantiquity between them. We will take the Epicureans first because,\\r\\nchronologically, they slightly preceded the Stoics.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPICURUS.--Epicurus, born at Athens a little after the death of\\r\\nPlato, brought up at Samos by his parents who had been forced to expatriate\\r\\nthemselves owing to reverses of fortune, returned to Athens about 305 B.C.,\\r\\nand there founded a school. Personally he was a true wise man, sober,\\r\\nscrupulous, a despiser of pleasure, severe to himself, _in practice_ a\\r\\nStoic. As his general view of the universe, he taught approximately the\\r\\ndoctrine of Democritus: the world is composed of a multitude of atoms,\\r\\nendowed with certain movements, which attach themselves to one another and\\r\\ncombine together, and there is nothing else in the world. Is there not a\\r\\nfirst cause, a being who set all these atoms in motion--in short, a God?\\r\\nEpicurus did not think so. Are there gods, as the vulgar believe? Epicurus\\r\\nbelieved so; but he considered that the gods are brilliant, superior, happy\\r\\ncreatures, who do not trouble about this world, do not interfere with it,\\r\\nand are even less occupied, were it possible, with mankind. Also they did\\r\\nnot create the world, for why should they have created it? From goodness,\\r\\nsaid Plato; but there is so much evil in the world that if they created it\\r\\nfrom goodness, they were mistaken and must be fools; and if they willingly\\r\\npermitted evil, they are wicked; and therefore it is charitable towards\\r\\nthem to believe that they did not create it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEPICUREAN MORALITY.--From the ethical point of view, Epicurus\\r\\ncertainly attaches himself to Aristippus; but with the difference that lies\\r\\nbetween pleasure and happiness. Aristippus taught that the aim of life was\\r\\nintelligent pleasure, Epicurus declared that the aim of life was\\r\\nhappiness. Now, does happiness consist in pleasures, or does it exclude\\r\\nthem? Epicurus was quite convinced that it excluded them. Like Lord\\r\\nBeaconsfield, he would say, \"Life would be almost bearable, were it not for\\r\\nits pleasures.\" Happiness for Epicurus lay in \"phlegm,\" as Philinte would\\r\\nput it; it lay in the calm of the mind that has rendered itself\\r\\ninaccessible to every emotion of passion, which is never irritated, never\\r\\nmoved, never annoyed, never desires, and never fears. Why, for instance,\\r\\nshould we dread death? So long as we fear it, it is not here; when it\\r\\narrives, we shall no longer fear it; then, why is it an evil?--But, during\\r\\nlife itself, how about sufferings?--We greatly increase our sufferings by\\r\\ncomplaints and by self-commiseration. If we acted in the reverse way, if\\r\\nwhen we were tortured by them we recalled past pleasures and thought of\\r\\npleasures to come, they would be infinitely mitigated.--But, of what\\r\\npleasures can a man speak who makes happiness consist in the exclusion of\\r\\npleasures? The pleasures of the wise man are the satisfaction he feels in\\r\\nassuring himself of his own happiness. He finds pleasure when he controls a\\r\\npassion in order to revert to calmness; he feels pleasure when he converses\\r\\nwith his friends about the nature of true happiness; he feels pleasure when\\r\\nhe has diverted a youth from passionate follies or from despair, and\\r\\nbrought him back to peace of mind, etc.--But what about sufferings after\\r\\ndeath? They do not exist. There is no hell because there is no immortality\\r\\nof the soul. The soul is as material as the body, and dies with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will say, perhaps, that this very severe and austere morality more\\r\\nnearly approaches to Stoicism than to the teaching of Aristippus. This is\\r\\nso true that when Horace confessed with a smile that he returned to the\\r\\nmorality of pleasure, he did not say, as we should, \"I feel that I am\\r\\nbecoming an Epicurean,\" he said, \"I fall back on the precepts of\\r\\nAristippus;\" and Seneca, a professed Stoic, cites Epicurus almost as often\\r\\nas Zeno in his lessons. It may not be quite accurate to state, but there\\r\\nwould not be much exaggeration in affirming, that Epicureanism is a smiling\\r\\nStoicism and Stoicism a gloomy Epicureanism. In the current use of the word\\r\\nwe have changed the meaning of Epicurean to make it mean \"addicted to\\r\\npleasure.\" The warning must be given that there is no more grievous error.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VOGUE OF EPICUREANISM.--Epicureanism had an immense vogue in\\r\\nantiquity. The principal professors of it at Athens were Metrodorus,\\r\\nHermarchus, Polystratus, and Apollodorus. Penetrating to Italy Epicureanism\\r\\nfound its most brilliant representative in Lucretius, who of the system\\r\\nmade a poem--the admirable _De Natura Rerum_; there were also\\r\\nAtticus, Horace, Pliny the younger, and many more. It even became a\\r\\npolitical opinion: the Caesarians were Epicureans, the Republicans\\r\\nStoics. On the appearance of Christianity Epicureanism came into direct\\r\\nopposition with it, and so did Stoicism also; but in a far less degree. In\\r\\nmodern times, as will be seen, Epicureanism has enjoyed a revival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nSTOICISM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Passions are Diseases which can and must be Extirpated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LOGIC OF STOICISM.--Stoicism existed as a germ in the Cynic\\r\\nphilosophy (and also in Socrates) as did Epicureanism in Aristippus. Zeno\\r\\nwas the pupil of Crates. In extreme youth he opened a school at Athens in\\r\\nthe Poecile. The Poecile was a portico; portico in Greek is _stoa_,\\r\\nhence the name of Stoic. Zeno taught for about thirty years; then, on the\\r\\napproach of age, he died by his own hand. Zeno thought, as did Epicurus and\\r\\nSocrates, that philosophy should only be the science of life and that the\\r\\nscience of life lay in wisdom. Wisdom consists in thinking justly and\\r\\nacting rightly; but to think justly only in order to act rightly--which is\\r\\nquite in the spirit of Socrates, and eliminates all the science of\\r\\nresearch, all consideration of the constitution of the world as well as the\\r\\ntotal and even the details of matter. Therein is Stoicism more narrow than\\r\\nEpicureanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence, man needs clear, precise, and severe \"logic\" (the Stoics\\r\\nwere the first to use this word). Armed with this weapon, and only\\r\\nemploying it for self-knowledge and self-control, man makes himself\\r\\nwise. The \"wise man\" of the Stoic is a kind of saint--a superman, as it has\\r\\nsince been called--very analogous to his God. All his efforts are\\r\\nconcentrated on safeguarding, conquering, and suppressing his passions,\\r\\nwhich are nothing save \"diseases of the soul.\" In the external world he\\r\\ndisregards all the \"things of chance\"--everything, that is, that does not\\r\\ndepend on human will--and considers them as non-existent: the ailments of\\r\\nthe body, pangs, sufferings, misfortunes, and humiliations are not evils,\\r\\nthey are things indifferent. On the contrary, crimes and errors are such\\r\\nevils that they are _equally_ execrable, and the wise man should\\r\\nreproach himself as severely for the slightest fault as for the greatest\\r\\ncrime--a paradoxical doctrine which has aroused the warmth of even\\r\\nrespectful opponents of Stoicism, notably Cicero.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAXIMS OF THE STOICS.--Their most frequently repeated maxim is\\r\\n\"abstain and endure\"; abstain from all evil, suffer all aggression and\\r\\nso-called misfortune without rebelling or complaining. Another precept\\r\\nwidely propagated among them and by them, \"Live according to nature,\"\\r\\nremarkably resembles an Epicurean maxim. This must be made clear. This\\r\\nprecept as they interpreted it meant: adhere freely and respectfully to the\\r\\nlaws of the universe. The world is a God who lives according to the laws He\\r\\nHimself made, and of which we are not judges. These laws surround us and\\r\\ncompel us; sometimes they wound us. We must respect and obey them, have a\\r\\nsort of pious desire that they should operate even against ourselves, and\\r\\nlive in reverent conformity with them. Thus understood, the \"life in\\r\\nconformity with nature\" is nothing else than an aspect of the maxim,\\r\\n\"Endure.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPRINCIPAL STOICS.--The principal adepts and masters of Stoicism with\\r\\nand after Zeno were Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Aristo, and Herillus in Greece;\\r\\nat Rome, Cato, Brutus, Cicero to a certain degree, Thrasea, Epictetus\\r\\n(withal a Greek, who wrote in Greek), Seneca, and finally the Emperor\\r\\nMarcus Aurelius. Stoicism rapidly developed into a religion, having its\\r\\nrites, obediences, ascetic practices, directors of conscience, examination\\r\\nof conscience, and its adepts with a traditional dress, long cloak, and\\r\\nlong beard. It exerted considerable influence, comparable (comparable\\r\\nonly) to Christianity, but it penetrated only the upper and middle classes\\r\\nof society in antiquity without descending, or barely descending, to the\\r\\nmasses. Like Epicureanism, Stoicism had a renaissance in modern times in\\r\\nopposition to Christianity; this will be dealt with later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nECLECTICS AND SCEPTICS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophers who Wished to Belong to No School\\r\\nPhilosophers who Decried All Schools and All Doctrines.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWO TENDENCIES.--As might be expected to happen, and as always\\r\\nhappens, the multiplicity of sects brought about two tendencies, one\\r\\nconsisting in selecting somewhat arbitrarily from each sect what one found\\r\\nbest in it, which is called \"eclecticism,\" the other in thinking that no\\r\\nschool grasped the truth, that the truth is not to be grasped, which is\\r\\ncalled \"scepticism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ECLECTICS: PLUTARCH.--The Eclectics, who did not form a school,\\r\\nwhich would have been difficult in the spirit in which they acted, had only\\r\\nthis in common, that they venerated the great thinkers of ancient Greece,\\r\\nand that they felt or endeavoured to feel respect and toleration for all\\r\\nreligions. They venerated Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Zeno,\\r\\nMoses, Jesus, St. Paul, and loved to imagine that they were each a partial\\r\\nrevelation of the great divine thought, and they endeavoured to reconcile\\r\\nthese divergent revelations by proceeding on broad lines and general\\r\\nconsiderations. Among them were Moderatus, Nicomachus, Nemesius, etc. The\\r\\nmost illustrious, without being the most profound--though his literary\\r\\ntalent has always kept him prominent--was Plutarch. His chief effort, since\\r\\nthen often renewed, was to reconcile reason and faith (I am writing of the\\r\\npolytheistic faith). Perceiving in mythology ingenious allegories, he\\r\\nshowed that under the name of allegories covering and containing profound\\r\\nideas, all polytheism could be accepted by the reason of a Platonist, an\\r\\nAristotelian, or a Stoic. The Eclectics had not much influence, and only\\r\\npleased two sorts of minds: those who preferred knowledge rather than\\r\\nconviction, and found in Eclecticism an agreeable variety of points of\\r\\nview; and those who liked to believe a little in everything, and possessing\\r\\nreceptive but not steadfast minds were not far from sceptics and who might\\r\\nbe called affirmative sceptics in opposition to the negative sceptics:\\r\\nsceptics who say, \"Heavens, yes,\" as opposed to sceptics who always say,\\r\\n\"Presumably, no.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCEPTICS: PYRRHO.--The Sceptics proper were chronologically more\\r\\nancient. The first famous Sceptic was a contemporary of Aristotle; he\\r\\nfollowed Alexander on his great expedition into Asia. This was Pyrrho. He\\r\\ntaught, as it appears, somewhat obscurely at Athens, and for successor had\\r\\nTimon. These philosophers, like so many others, sought happiness and\\r\\naffirmed that it lay in abstention from decision, in the mind remaining in\\r\\nabeyance, in _aphasia_. Pyrrho being accustomed to say that he was\\r\\nindifferent whether he was alive or dead, on being asked, \"Then why do you\\r\\nlive?\" answered: \"Just because it is indifferent whether one lives or is\\r\\ndead.\" As may be imagined, their favourite sport was to draw the various\\r\\nschools into mutual opposition, to rout some by the rest, to show that all\\r\\nwere strong in what they negatived, but weak in what they affirmed, and so\\r\\nto dismiss them in different directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NEW ACADEMY.--Scepticism, albeit attenuated, softened, and less\\r\\naggressive, reappeared in a school calling itself the New Academy. It\\r\\nclaimed to adhere to Socrates--not without some show of reason, since\\r\\nSocrates had declared that the only thing he knew was that he knew\\r\\nnothing--and the essential tenet of this school was to affirm nothing. Only\\r\\nthe Academicians believed that certain things were probable, more probable\\r\\nthan others, and they are the founders of probabilism, which is nothing\\r\\nmore than conviction accompanied with modesty. They were more or less\\r\\nmoderate, according to personal temperament. Arcesilaus was emphatically\\r\\nmoderate, and limited himself to the development of the critical faculties\\r\\nof his pupil. Carneades was more negative, and arrived at or reverted to\\r\\nscepticism and sophistry pure and simple. Cicero, with a certain foundation\\r\\nof Stoicism, was a pupil, and one of the most moderate, of the New Academy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAENESIDEMUS; AGRIPPA; EMPIRICUS.--Others built on experience itself,\\r\\non the incertitude of our sensations and observations, on everything that\\r\\ncan cheat us and cause us illusion in order to display how _relative_\\r\\nand how miserably partial is human knowledge. Such was Aenesidemus, whom\\r\\nit might be thought Pascal had read, so much does the latter give the\\r\\nreasons of the former when he is not absorbed in faith, and when he assumes\\r\\nthe position of a sceptic precisely in order to prove the necessity of\\r\\ntaking refuge in faith. Such was Agrippa; such, too, was Sextus Empiricus,\\r\\nso often critical of science, who demonstrates (as to a slight extent M.\\r\\nHenri Poincar\\xc3\\xa9 does in our own day) that all sciences, even those which,\\r\\nlike mathematics and geometry, are proudest of their certainty, rest upon\\r\\nconventions and intellectual \"conveniences.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X\\r\\n\\r\\nNEOPLATONISM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReversion to Metaphysics.\\r\\nImaginative Metaphysicians after the Manner of Plato, but in Excess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALEXANDRINISM.--Amid all this, metaphysics--namely, the effort to\\r\\ncomprehend the universe--appears somewhat at a discount. It enjoyed a\\r\\nrenaissance in the third century of our era among some teachers from\\r\\nAlexandria (hence the name of the Alexandrine school) who came to lecture\\r\\nat Rome with great success. Alexandrinism is a \"Neoplatonism\"--that is, a\\r\\nrenewed Platonism and, as considered by its authors, an augmented one.\\r\\n\\r\\nPLOTINUS.--Plotinus taught this: God and matter exist. God is one,\\r\\nmatter is multiple and divisible. God in Himself is incomprehensible, and\\r\\nis only to be apprehended in his manifestations. Man rises not to\\r\\ncomprehension of Him but to the perception of Him by a series of degrees\\r\\nwhich are, as it were, the progressive purification of faith, and which\\r\\nlead us to a kind of union with Him resembling that of one being with\\r\\nanother whom he could never see, but of whose presence he could have no\\r\\ndoubt. Matter, that is, the universe, is an emanation from God, as perfume\\r\\ncomes from a flower. All is not God, and only God can be God, but all is\\r\\ndivine and all participates in God, just as each of our thoughts\\r\\nparticipates of our soul. Now, if all emanates from God, all also tends to\\r\\nreturn to Him, as bodies born of earth, nourished by earth, invigorated by\\r\\nthe forces proceeding from the earth, tend to return to the earth. This is\\r\\nwhat makes the harmony of the world. The law of laws is, that every\\r\\nfragment of the universe derived from God returns to Him and desires to\\r\\nreturn to Him. The universe is an emanation from the perfect, and an\\r\\neffort towards perfection. The universe is a God in exile who has\\r\\nnostalgia for himself. The universe is a progressive descent from God with\\r\\na tendency towards reintegration with Him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does this emanation from God becoming matter take place? That is a\\r\\nmystery; but it may be supposed to take place by successive stages. From\\r\\nGod emanates spirit, impersonal spirit which is not spirit of this or that,\\r\\nbut universal spirit spread through the whole world and animating it. From\\r\\nspirit emanates the soul, which can unite itself to a body and form an\\r\\nindividual. The soul is less divine than spirit, which in turn is less\\r\\ndivine than God, but yet retains divinity. From the soul emanates the body\\r\\nto which it unites itself. The body is less divine than the soul, which was\\r\\nless divine than spirit, which was less divine than God; but it still\\r\\npossesses divinity for it has a form, a figure, a design marked and\\r\\nimpressed with divine spirit. Finally, matter without form is the most\\r\\ndistant of the emanations from God, and the lowest of the descending stages\\r\\nof God. God _is_ in Himself; He thinks in pure thought in spirit; He\\r\\nthinks in mixed and confused thought in the soul; He feels in the body; He\\r\\nsleeps in unformed matter. The object of unformed matter is to acquire\\r\\nform, that is a body; and the object of a body is to have a soul; and the\\r\\naim of a soul is to be united in spirit, and the aim of spirit is to be\\r\\nabsorbed into God.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouls not united to bodies contemplate spirit and enjoy absolute\\r\\nhappiness. Other souls not united to bodies, but solicited by a certain\\r\\ninstinct to unite themselves to bodies, are of ambiguous but still very\\r\\nexalted nature. Souls united to bodies (our own) have descended far, but\\r\\ncan raise themselves and be purified by contemplation of the eternal\\r\\nintelligence, and by relative union with it. This contemplation has\\r\\nseveral degrees, so to speak, of intensity, degrees which Plotinus termed\\r\\nhypostases. By perception we obtain a glimpse of ideas, by dialectics we\\r\\npenetrate them; by a final hypostasis, which is ecstasy, we can sometimes\\r\\nunite ourselves directly to God and live in Him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PUPILS OF PLOTINUS.--Plotinus had as pupils and successors,\\r\\namongst others, Porphyry and Iamblichus. Porphyry achieves little except\\r\\nthe exposition of the doctrine of his master, and shows originality only as\\r\\na logician. Iamblichus and his school made a most interesting effort to\\r\\nrevive exhausted and expiring paganism and to constitute a philosophic\\r\\npaganism. The philosophers of the school of Iamblichus are, by the way,\\r\\nmagicians, charlatans, miracle-mongers, men as antipositivist as\\r\\npossible. Iamblichus himself sought to reconcile polytheism with\\r\\nNeoplatonism by putting in the centre of all a supreme deity, an essential\\r\\ndeity from whom he made a crowd of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary\\r\\ndeities to emanate, ranging from those purely immaterial to those inherent\\r\\nin matter. The subtle wanderings of Neoplatonism were continued obscurely\\r\\nin the school of Athens until it was closed for ever in 529 by the Emperor\\r\\nJustinian as being hostile to the religion of the Empire, which at that\\r\\nepoch was Christianity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRISTIANITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophic Ideas which Christianity Welcomed, Adopted, or Created\\r\\nHow it must Give a Fresh Aspect to All Philosophy,\\r\\neven that Foreign to Itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY AND MORALITY.--Christianity spread through the\\r\\nEmpire by the propaganda of the Apostles, and more especially St. Paul,\\r\\nfrom about the year 40. Its success was extremely rapid, especially among\\r\\nthe populace, and little by little it won over the upper classes. As a\\r\\ngeneral philosophy, primitive Christianity did not absolutely bring more\\r\\nthan the Hebrew dogmas: the unity of God, a providential Deity, that is,\\r\\none directly interfering in human affairs; immortality of the soul with\\r\\nrewards and penalties beyond the grave (a recent theory among the Jews, yet\\r\\none anterior to Christianity). As a moral system, Christianity brought\\r\\nsomething so novel and so beautiful that it is not very probable that\\r\\nhumanity will ever surpass it, which may be imperfectly and incompletely\\r\\nsummed up thus: love of God; He must not only be feared as He was by the\\r\\npagans and the ancient Jews; He must be loved passionately as a son loves\\r\\nhis father, and all things must be done for this love and in consideration\\r\\nof this love; all men are brethren as sons of God, and they should love one\\r\\nanother as brothers; love your neighbour as yourself, love him who does not\\r\\nlove you; love your enemies; be not greedy for the goods of this world, nor\\r\\nambitious, nor proud; for God loves the lowly, the humble, the suffering,\\r\\nand the miserable, and He will exalt the lowly and put down the mighty from\\r\\ntheir seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing like this had been said in all antiquity, and it needs\\r\\nextraordinary ingenuity (of a highly interesting character, by the way), to\\r\\nfind in ancient wisdom even a few traces of this doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, into politics, so to speak, Christianity brought this novelty:\\r\\nthere are two empires, the empire of God and the empire of man; you do not\\r\\nowe everything to the earthly empire; you are bound to give it faithfully\\r\\nonly what is needed for it to be strong and to preserve society; apart from\\r\\nthat, and that done, you are the subject of God and have only to answer to\\r\\nGod for your thoughts, your belief, your conscience; and over that portion\\r\\nof yourself the State has neither right nor authority unless it be usurped\\r\\nand tyrannical. And therein lay the charter of individual liberty like the\\r\\ncharter of the rights of man.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs appeal to the feelings, Christianity brought the story of a young God,\\r\\ninfinitely good and gentle, who had never cursed, who had been infinitely\\r\\nloved, who had been persecuted and betrayed, who had forgiven his\\r\\nexecutioners, and who died in great sufferings and who was to be imitated\\r\\n(whence came the thirst for martyrdom). This story in itself is not more\\r\\naffecting than that of Socrates, but it is that of a young martyr and not\\r\\nof an old one, and therein lies a marked difference for the imagination and\\r\\nemotions of the multitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SUCCESS OF CHRISTIANITY.--The prodigious rapidity of the success\\r\\nof Christianity is easily explicable. Polytheism had no longer a great hold\\r\\non the masses, and no philosophic doctrine had found or had even sought the\\r\\npath to the crowd; Christianity, essentially democratic, loved the weak and\\r\\nhumble, had a tendency to prefer them to the great ones of this world, and\\r\\nto regard them as being more the children of God, and was therefore\\r\\nreceived by the masses as the only doctrine which could replace the\\r\\nworm-eaten polytheism. And in Christianity they saw the religion for which\\r\\nthey were waiting, and in the heads of Christianity their own protectors\\r\\nand defenders.\\r\\n\\r\\nITS EVOLUTION.--The evolution of Christianity was very rapid, and\\r\\nfrom a great moral doctrine with a minimum of rudimentary metaphysics it\\r\\nbecame, perchance mistakenly, a philosophy giving account, or desirous of\\r\\ngiving account of everything; it so to speak incorporated a metaphysic,\\r\\nborrowed in great part from Greek philosophy, in great part from the Hebrew\\r\\ntraditions. It possessed ideas on the origin of matter, and whilst\\r\\nmaintaining that God was eternal, denied that matter was, and asserted that\\r\\nGod created it out of nothing. It had theories on the essence of God, and\\r\\nsaw Him in three Persons, or hypostases, one aspect of God as power,\\r\\nanother as love, and the other as intelligence. It presented theories on\\r\\nthe incarnation and humanisation of God, God being made man in Jesus Christ\\r\\nwithout ceasing to be God. It conceived new relationships of man to God,\\r\\nman having in himself powers of purgation and perfection, but always\\r\\nneeding divine help for self-perfection (theory of grace). And this he\\r\\nmust believe; if not he would feel insolent pride in his freedom. It had\\r\\nideas about the existence of evil, declaring in \"justification of God\" for\\r\\nhaving permitted evil on earth, that the world was a place of trial, and\\r\\nthat evil was only a way of putting man to the test and discovering what\\r\\nwere his merits. It had its notions on the rewards and penalties beyond the\\r\\ngrave, hell for the wicked and heaven for the good, as had been known to\\r\\nantiquity, but added purgatory, a place for both punishment and\\r\\npurification by punishment, an entirely Platonic theory, which Plato may\\r\\nhave inspired but did not himself entertain. Finally, it was a complete\\r\\nphilosophy answering, and that in a manner often admirable, all the\\r\\nquestions that mankind put or could ever put.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as so often happens, that has proved a weakness and a strength to it:\\r\\na weakness because embarrassed with subtle, complicated, insoluble\\r\\nquestions wherein mankind will always be involved, it was forced to engage\\r\\nin endless discussions wherein the bad or feeble reasons advanced by this\\r\\nor that votary compromised the whole work; a strength because whoever\\r\\nbrings a rule of life is practically compelled to support it by general\\r\\nideas bearing on the relations of things and to give it a place in a\\r\\ngeneral survey of the world; otherwise he appears impotent, weak,\\r\\ndisqualified to give that very rule of life, incapable of replying to the\\r\\ninterrogations raised by that rule of life; and finally, lacking in\\r\\nauthority.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHISMS AND HERESIES.--Right or wrong, and it is difficult and\\r\\nhighly hazardous to decide the question, Christianity was a complete\\r\\nphilosophy, which was why it had its schisms and heresies, a certain number\\r\\nof sincere Christians not resolving the metaphysical questions in the way\\r\\nof the majority. Heresies were innumerable; only the two shall be cited\\r\\nwhich are deeply interesting in the history of philosophy. Manes, an Arab\\r\\n(and Arabia was then a Persian province), revived the old Zoroastrian\\r\\ndoctrine of two principles of good and evil, and saw in the world two\\r\\ncontending gods, the God of perfection and the god of sin, and laid upon\\r\\nman the duty of assisting the God of goodness so that His kingdom should\\r\\ncome and cause the destruction of evil in the world. From him proceeded the\\r\\nManicheans, who exerted great influence and were condemned by many Councils\\r\\nuntil their sect died out, only to reappear or seem to reappear fairly\\r\\noften in the Middle Ages and in modern times.\\r\\n\\r\\nArius denied the Trinity, believing only in one God, not only unique, but\\r\\nin one Person, and in consequence denied the divinity of Jesus Christ. He\\r\\nwas perpetually involved in controversies and polemics, supported by some\\r\\nBishops, opposed by the majority. After his death his doctrine spread\\r\\nstrangely. It was stifled in the East by Theodosius, but was widely\\r\\nadopted by the \"barbarians\" of the West (Goths, Vandals, Burgundians,\\r\\nLombards). It was revived, more or less exactly, after the Reformation,\\r\\namong the Socinians.\\r\\n\\r\\nROME AND CHRISTIANITY.--The relations of Christianity with the Roman\\r\\ngovernment were in the highest degree tragic, as is common knowledge. There\\r\\nwere ten sanguinary persecutions, some being atrocious. It has often been\\r\\nasked what was the cause of this animosity against the Christians on the\\r\\npart of a government which tolerated all religions and all\\r\\nphilosophies. Persecutions were natural at Athens where a democracy,\\r\\nobstinately attached to the local deities, treated as enemies of the\\r\\ncountry those who did not take these gods into consideration; persecutions\\r\\nwere natural on the part of a Calvin or a Louis XIV who combined in\\r\\nthemselves the two authorities and would not admit that anyone in the State\\r\\nhad the right to think differently from its head; but it has been argued\\r\\nthat they were incomprehensible on the part of a government which admitted\\r\\nall cults and all doctrines. The explanation perhaps primarily lies in the\\r\\nfact that Christianity was essentially popular, and that the government saw\\r\\nin it not only plebeianism, which was disquieting, but an organisation of\\r\\nplebeianism, which was still more so. The administration of religion had\\r\\nalways been in the hands of the aristocracy; the Roman pontiffs were\\r\\npatricians, the Emperor was the sovereign pontiff; to yield obedience, even\\r\\nwere it only spiritually, to private men as priests was to be disobedient\\r\\nto the Roman aristocracy, to the Emperor himself, and was properly speaking\\r\\na revolt.\\r\\n\\r\\nA further explanation, perhaps, is that each new religion that was\\r\\nintroduced at Rome did not oppose and did not contradict polytheism, the\\r\\nprinciple of polytheism being precisely that there are many gods; whereas\\r\\nChristianity denying all those gods and affirming that there is only one,\\r\\nand that all others must be despised as non-existent, inveighed against,\\r\\ndenied, and ruined or threatened to destroy the very essence of\\r\\npolytheism. It was not a variation, it was a heresy; it was more than\\r\\nheretical, it was anarchical; it did not only condemn this or that\\r\\nreligion, but even the very tolerance with which the Roman government\\r\\naccepted all religions. Hence it is natural enough that it should have been\\r\\ncombated to the utmost by practically all the Emperors, from the most\\r\\nexecrable, such as Nero, to the best, such as Marcus Aurelius.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRISTIANITY AND THE PHILOSOPHERS.--The relations of Christianity\\r\\nwith philosophy were confused. The immense majority of philosophers\\r\\nrejected it, considering their own views superior to it, and moreover,\\r\\nfeeling it to be formidable, made use against it of all that could be found\\r\\nbeautiful, specious, or expedient in ancient philosophy; and the ardour of\\r\\nNeoplatonism, which we have considered, in part arose from precisely this\\r\\ninstinct of rivalry and of struggle. At that epoch there was a throng of\\r\\nmen like Ernest Havet presenting Hellenism in opposition to Christianity,\\r\\nand Ernest Havet is only a Neoplatonist of the nineteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain number of philosophers, nevertheless, either on the\\r\\nJewish-Christian side or on the Hellenic, tried some reconciliation either\\r\\nas Jews making advances to Hellenism or as Greeks admitting there was\\r\\nsomething acceptable on the part of Sion. Aristobulus, a Jew (prior to\\r\\nJesus Christ), seems to have endeavoured to bring Moses into agreement with\\r\\nPlato; Philo (a Jew contemporary with and surviving Jesus Christ and a\\r\\nnon-Christian), about whom there is more information, throughout his life\\r\\npursued the plan of demonstrating all the resemblances he could discover\\r\\nbetween Plato and the Old Testament, much in the same way as in our time\\r\\nsome have striven to point out the surprising agreement of the Darwinian\\r\\ntheory with Genesis. He was called the Jewish Plato, and at Alexandria it\\r\\nwas said: \"Philo imitates Plato or Plato imitates Philo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn their side, later on, certain eclectic Greeks already cited, Moderatus,\\r\\nNicomachus, Nemesius, extended goodwill so far as to take into account, if\\r\\nnot Jesus, at least Moses, and to admit Israelitish thought into the\\r\\nhistory of philosophy and of human wisdom. But, in general it was by the\\r\\nschools of philosophy and by the ever dwindling section of society priding\\r\\nitself upon its philosophy that Christianity was most decisively repulsed,\\r\\nthrust on one side and misunderstood.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS.--Without dealing with many others who belong\\r\\nmore especially to the history of the Church rather than to that of\\r\\nphilosophy, the Christians did not lack two very illustrious philosophers\\r\\nwho must receive attention--Origen and St. Augustine.\\r\\n\\r\\nORIGEN.--Origen was a native of Alexandria at the close of the\\r\\nsecond century, and a pupil of St. Clement of Alexandria. A Christian and a\\r\\nPlatonist, in order to give himself permission and excuse for reconciling\\r\\nthe two doctrines, he alleged that the Apostles had given only so much of\\r\\nthe Christian teaching as the multitude could comprehend, and that the\\r\\nlearned could interpret it in a manner more subtle, more profound, and more\\r\\ncomplete. Having observed this precaution, he revealed his system, which\\r\\nwas this: God is a pure spirit. He already has descended one step in\\r\\n_spirits_ which are emanations from Him. These spirits are capable of\\r\\ngood and evil. When addicted to evil, they clothe themselves with matter\\r\\nand become souls in bodies;--which is what we are. There are others lower\\r\\nthan ourselves. There are impure spirits which have clothed themselves\\r\\nwith unclean bodies; these are demons. Now, as the fallen brethren of\\r\\nangels, we are free, less free than they, but still free. Through this\\r\\nfreedom we can in our present existence either raise or lower\\r\\nourselves. But this freedom does not suffice us; a little help is\\r\\nessential. This help comes to us from the spirits which have remained\\r\\npure. The help they afford us is opposed by the efforts of the utterly\\r\\nfallen spirits who are lower in the scale than ourselves. To combat these\\r\\nfallen spirits, to help the pure spirits who help us, and to help them to\\r\\nhelp us, such is our duty in this life, which is a medicine, the medicine\\r\\nof Plato, namely a punishment; sterile when it is not accepted by us,\\r\\nsalutary when gratefully accepted by us, it then becomes expiation and in\\r\\nconsequence purification. The part of the Redeemer in all this is the same\\r\\nas that of the spirits, but on a grander and more decisive plane. King of\\r\\nspirits, Spirit of spirits, by revelation He illumines our confused\\r\\nintelligence and fortifies our weak will against temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\nST. AUGUSTINE.--St. Augustine of Tagaste (in Africa), long a pagan\\r\\nexercising the profession of professor of rhetoric, became a Christian and\\r\\nwas Bishop of Hippo. It is he who \"fixed\" the Christian doctrine in the way\\r\\nmost suitable to and most acceptable to Western intelligence. Instead of\\r\\nconfusing it, more or less intentionally, more or less inadvertently, with\\r\\nphilosophy, he exerted all his great talents to make the most precise\\r\\ndistinction from it. Philosophers (he says) have always regarded the world\\r\\nas an emanation from God. Then all is God. Such is not the way to\\r\\nreason. There is no emanation, but creation; God created the world and has\\r\\nremained distinct from it. He lives in it in such a way that we live in\\r\\nHim; in Him we live and move and have our being; He dwells throughout the\\r\\nworld, but He is not the world; He is everywhere but He is not all. God\\r\\ncreated the world. Then, can it be said that before the world was created\\r\\nGod remained doing nothing during an immense space of time? Certainly not,\\r\\nbecause time only began at the creation of the world. God is outside\\r\\ntime. The eternal is the absence of time. God, therefore, was not an\\r\\ninstant before He created the world. Or, if it be preferred, there was an\\r\\neternity before the birth of the world. But it is the same thing; for\\r\\neternity is the non-existence of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome understand God in three Persons as three Gods. This polytheism, this\\r\\npaganism must be rejected. But how to understand? How? You feel in\\r\\nyourself several souls? No. And yet there are several faculties of the\\r\\nsoul. The three Persons of God are the three divine faculties. Man has body\\r\\nand soul. No one ought to have doubts about the soul, for to have doubts\\r\\npresupposes thought, and to think is to be; above all things we are\\r\\nthinking beings. But what is the soul? Something immaterial, assuredly,\\r\\nsince it can conceive immaterial things, such as a line, a point, surface,\\r\\nspace. It is as necessary for the soul to be immaterial in order to be able\\r\\nto grasp the immaterial, as it is necessary for the hand to be material in\\r\\norder that it can grasp a stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhence comes the soul? From the souls of ancestors by transmission? This is\\r\\nnot probable, for this would be to regard it as material. From God by\\r\\nemanation? This is inadmissible; it is the same error as believing that the\\r\\nworld emanates from God. Here, too, there is no emanation, but creation.\\r\\nGod creates the souls in destination for bodies themselves born from\\r\\nheredity. Once the body is destroyed, what becomes of the soul? It cannot\\r\\nperish; for thought not being dependent upon the senses, there is no reason\\r\\nfor its disappearance on the disappearance of the senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman liberty is an assured fact; we are free to do good or evil. But then\\r\\nGod has not been able to know in advance what I shall do to-day, and in\\r\\nconsequence God, at least in His knowledge, has limitations, is not\\r\\nomnipotent. St. Augustine replies confusedly (for the question is\\r\\nundoubtedly insoluble) that we have an illusion of liberty, an illusion\\r\\nthat we are free, which suffices for us to acquire merit if we do right and\\r\\ndemerit if we do wrong, and that this illusion of liberty is a relative\\r\\nliberty, which leaves the prescience of God, and therefore His omnipotence,\\r\\nabsolute. Man is also extremely weak, debilitated, and incapable of good on\\r\\naccount of original sin, the sin of our first parents, which is transmitted\\r\\nto us through heredity and paralyses us. But God helps us, and this is what\\r\\nis termed grace. He helps us gratuitously, as is indicated by the word\\r\\n\"grace\"--if He wishes and when He wishes and in the measure that He wishes.\\r\\nFrom this arises the doctrine of \"predestination,\" by which it is\\r\\npreordained whether a man is to be saved or lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II\\r\\n\\r\\nIN THE MIDDLE AGES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nFROM THE FIFTH CENTURY TO THE THIRTEENTH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy is only an Interpreter of Dogma.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it is Declared Contrary to Dogma by the Authority of Religion,\\r\\nit is a Heresy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrthodox and Heterodox Interpretations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Independent Philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOGMA.--After the invasion of the barbarians, philosophy, like\\r\\nliterature, sought refuge in monasteries and in the schools which prelates\\r\\ninstituted and maintained near them. But the Church does not permit the\\r\\nfree search for truth. The truth has been established by the Fathers of the\\r\\nChurch and fixed by the Councils. Thenceforth the philosophic life, so to\\r\\nspeak, which had never been interrupted, assumed a fresh character. Within\\r\\nthe Church it sheltered--I will not say disguised--itself under the\\r\\ninterpretation of dogma; it became a sort of respectful auxiliary of\\r\\ntheology, and was accordingly called the \"handmaid of theology,\" _ancilla\\r\\ntheologiae_. When emancipated, when departing from dogma, it is a\\r\\n\"heresy,\" and all the great heresies are nothing else than schools of\\r\\nphilosophy, which is why heresies must come into a history of\\r\\nphilosophy. And at last, but only towards the close of the Middle Ages, lay\\r\\nthought without disturbing itself about dogma and no longer thinking about\\r\\nits interpretation, created philosophic doctrines exactly as the\\r\\nphilosophers of antiquity invented them apart from religion, to which they\\r\\nwere either hostile or indifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHOLASTICISM: SCOTUS ERIGENA.--The orthodox philosophy of the\\r\\nMiddle Ages was the scholastic. Scholasticism consisted in amassing and in\\r\\nmaking known scientific facts and matters of knowledge of which it was\\r\\nuseful for a well-bred man not to be ignorant and for this purpose\\r\\nencyclopaedias were constructed; on the other hand, it consisted not\\r\\nprecisely in the reconciliation of faith with reason, not precisely and far\\r\\nless in the submission of faith to the criticism of reason, but in making\\r\\nfaith sensible to reason, as had been the office of the Fathers of the\\r\\nChurch, more especially St. Augustine.\\r\\n\\r\\nScotus Erigena, a Scotsman attached to the Palatine Academy of Charles the\\r\\nBald, lived in the eleventh century. He was extremely learned. His\\r\\nphilosophy was Platonic, or rather the bent of his mind was Platonic. God\\r\\nis the absolute Being; He is unnamable, since any name is a delimitation of\\r\\nthe being; He _is_ absolutely and infinitely. As the creator of all\\r\\nand uncreated, He is the cause _per se_; as the goal to which all\\r\\nthings tend, He is the supreme end. The human soul is of impenetrable\\r\\nessence like God Himself; accordingly, it is God in us. We have fallen\\r\\nthrough the body and, whilst in the flesh, we can, by virtue and more\\r\\nespecially by the virtue of penitence, raise ourselves to the height of the\\r\\nangels. The world is the continuous creation of God. It must not be said\\r\\nthat God created the world, but that He creates it; for if He ceased from\\r\\nsustaining it, the world would no longer exist. God is perpetual creation\\r\\nand perpetual attraction. He draws all beings to Himself, and in the end He\\r\\nwill have them all in Himself. There is predestination to perfection in\\r\\neverything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese theories, some of which, as has been seen, go beyond dogma and form\\r\\nat least the beginning of heresy, are all impregnated with Platonism,\\r\\nespecially with Neoplatonism, and lead to the supposition that Scotus\\r\\nErigena possessed very wide Greek learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nARABIAN SCIENCE.--A great literary and philosophical fact in the\\r\\neighth century was the invasion of the Arabs. Mahometans successively\\r\\ninvaded Syria, Persia, Africa, and Spain, forming a crescent, the two\\r\\npoints of which touched the two extremities of Europe. Inquisitive and\\r\\nsagacious pupils of the Greeks in Africa and Asia, they founded everywhere\\r\\nbrilliant universities which rapidly acquired renown (Bagdad, Bassorah,\\r\\nCordova, Granada, Seville, Murcia) and brought to Europe a new quota of\\r\\nscience; for instance, all the works of Aristotle, of which Western Europe\\r\\npossessed practically nothing. Students greedy for knowledge came to learn\\r\\nfrom them in Spain; for instance, Gerbert, who developed into a man of\\r\\ngreat learning, who taught at Rheims and became Pope. Individually the\\r\\nArabs were often great philosophers, and at least the names must be\\r\\nmentioned of Avicenna (a Neoplatonist of the tenth century) and Averroes\\r\\n(an Aristotelian of the twelfth century who betrayed tendencies towards\\r\\nadmitting the eternity of nature, and its evolution through its own\\r\\ninitiative during the course of time). Their doctrines were propagated,\\r\\nand the ancient books which they made known became widely diffused. From\\r\\nthem dates the sway of Aristotle throughout the middle ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nST. ANSELM.--St. Anselm, in the eleventh century, a Savoyard, who\\r\\nwas long Abbot of Bec in Normandy and died Archbishop of Canterbury, is one\\r\\nof the most illustrious doctors of philosophy in the service of theology\\r\\nthat ever lived. \"A new St. Augustine\" (as he has been called), he starts\\r\\nfrom faith to arrive at faith after it has been rendered sensible to\\r\\nreason. Like St. Augustine he says: \"I believe in order to understand\"\\r\\n(well persuaded that if I never believed I should never understand), and he\\r\\nadds what had been in the thought of St. Augustine: \"I understand in order\\r\\nto believe.\" St. Anselm proved the existence of God by the most abstract\\r\\narguments. For example, \"It is necessary to have a cause, one or multiple;\\r\\none is God; multiple, it can be derived from one single cause, and that one\\r\\ncause is God; it can be a particular cause in each thing caused; but then\\r\\nit is necessary to suppose a personal force which must itself have a cause\\r\\nand thus we work back to a common cause, that is to say to a single one.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe proved God again by the proof which has remained famous under the name\\r\\nof the argument of St. Anselm: To conceive God is to prove that He is; the\\r\\nconception of God is proof of His existence; for every idea has its object;\\r\\nabove all, an idea which has infinity for object takes for granted the\\r\\nexistence of infinity; for all being finite here below, what would give the\\r\\nidea of infinity to the human mind? Therefore, if the human brain has the\\r\\nidea of infinity it is because of the existence of infinity. The argument\\r\\nis perhaps open to difference of opinion, but as proof of a singular vigour\\r\\nof mind on the part of its author, it is indisputable.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly intellectual also is his explanation of the necessity of\\r\\nredemption. _Cur Deus Homo?_ (the title of one of his works) asked\\r\\nSt. Anselm. Because sin in relation to an infinite God is an infinite\\r\\ncrime. Man, finite and limited in capacity, could therefore never expiate\\r\\nit. Then what could God do to avenge His honour and to have satisfaction\\r\\nrendered to Him? He could only make Himself man without ceasing to be God,\\r\\nin order that as man He should offer to God a reparation to which as God He\\r\\nwould give the character of infinitude. It was therefore absolutely\\r\\nnecessary that at a given moment man should become God, which could only be\\r\\ndone upon the condition that God made Himself man.\\r\\n\\r\\nREALISTS; NOMINALISTS; CONCEPTUALISTS.--It was in the time of\\r\\nSt. Anselm that there arose the celebrated philosophic quarrel between the\\r\\n\"realists, nominalists, and conceptualists.\" It is here essential to employ\\r\\nthese technical terms or else not to allude to the dispute at all, because\\r\\nthe strife is above all a war of words. The realists (of whom St. Anselm\\r\\nwas one), said: \"The ideas (idea of virtue, idea of sin, idea of greatness,\\r\\nidea of littleness) are realities; they exist, in a spiritual manner of\\r\\ncourse, but they really exist; they are: there is a virtue, a sin, a\\r\\ngreatness, a littleness, a reason, etc. (and this was an exact reminiscence\\r\\nof the ideas of Plato). It is indeed only the idea, the general, the\\r\\nuniversal, which is real, and the particular has only the appearance of\\r\\nreality. Men do not exist, the individual man does not exist; what exists\\r\\nis \\'man\\' in general, and individual men are only the appearance of--the\\r\\ncoloured reflections of--the universal man.\" The nominalists (Roscelin the\\r\\nCanon of Compi\\xc3\\xa8gne, for instance) answered: \"No; the general ideas, the\\r\\nuniversals as you say, are only names, are only words, emissions of the\\r\\nvoice, labels, if you like, which we place on such and such categories of\\r\\nfacts observed by us; there is no greatness; there are a certain number of\\r\\ngreat things, and when we think of them we inscribe this word \\'greatness\\'\\r\\non the general idea which we conceive. \\'Man\\' does not exist; there are men\\r\\nand the word humanity is only a word which to us represents a collective\\r\\nidea.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did the realists cling so to their universals, held to be realities and\\r\\nthe sole realities? For many reasons. If the individual alone be real,\\r\\nthere are not three Persons in the Godhead, there are three Gods and the\\r\\nunity of God is not real, it is only a word, and God is not real, He is\\r\\nonly an utterance of the voice. If the individual is not real, the Church\\r\\nis not real; she does not exist, there only exist Christians who possess\\r\\nfreedom of thought and of faith. Now the Church is real and it is not only\\r\\ndesirable that she should be real, but even that she alone should possess\\r\\nreality and that the individuals constituting her should exist by her and\\r\\nnot by themselves. (This is precisely the doctrine with regard to society\\r\\nnow current among certain philosophers: society exists independently of its\\r\\nmembers; it has laws of its own independently of its members; it is a\\r\\nreality on its own basis; and its members are by it, not it by them, and\\r\\ntherefore they should obey it; M. Durckheim is a \"realist.\")\\r\\n\\r\\nABELARD of Nantes, pupil of the nominalist, William of Champeaux,\\r\\nlearned man, artist, man of letters, an incomparable orator, tried to\\r\\neffect a conciliation. He said: \"The universal is not a reality, certainly;\\r\\nbut it is something more than a simple word; it is a conception of the\\r\\nmind, which is something more than an utterance of the voice. As conception\\r\\nof the mind, in fact, it lives with a life which goes beyond the\\r\\nindividual, because it can be common to several individuals to many\\r\\nindividuals, and because in fact it is common to them. The general idea\\r\\nthat I have and which I have communicated to my hearers, and which returns\\r\\nto me from my hearers, is more than a word since it is a link between my\\r\\nhearers and myself, and an atmosphere in which I and my hearers live. Is\\r\\nthe Church only to be a word? God forbid that I should say so. She is a\\r\\nbond between all Christians; she is a general idea common to them all, so\\r\\nthat in her each individual feels himself several, feels himself many;\\r\\nalthough it is true that were she not believed in by anyone she would be\\r\\nnothing.\" At bottom he was a nominalist, but more subtle, also more\\r\\nprofound and more precise, having a better grasp of what William of\\r\\nChampeaux had desired to say. He shared in his condemnation.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the great dispute, his ideas were singularly broad and\\r\\nbold. Half knowing, half guessing at ancient philosophy, he held it in high\\r\\nesteem; he found there, because he delighted in finding there, all the\\r\\nChristian ideas: the one God, the Trinity, the Incarnation, the imputation\\r\\nof the merits of the saints, original sin; and he found less of a gulf\\r\\nbetween ancient philosophy and Christianity than between the Old and the\\r\\nNew Testament (this is because the only Christianity known to Abelard, not\\r\\nthe primitive but that constituted in the fourth century, was profoundly\\r\\nimpregnated with Hellenism). He believed the Holy Ghost to have revealed\\r\\nHimself to the wise men of antiquity as well as to the Jews and the\\r\\nChristians, and that virtuous pagans may have been saved. The moral\\r\\nphilosophy of Abelard is very elevated and pure. Our acts proceed from\\r\\nGod; for it is impossible that they should not; but He permits us the\\r\\nfaculty of disobedience \"in order that virtue may exist,\" to which it\\r\\ntends; for if the tendency to evil did not exist, there would be no\\r\\npossibility of effort against evil, and if no efforts, then no virtue; God,\\r\\nwho cannot be virtuous since He cannot be tempted by evil, can be virtuous\\r\\nin man, which is why He leaves him the tendency to evil for him to triumph\\r\\nover it and be virtuous so that virtue may exist; even if He were Himself\\r\\nto lead us into temptation, the tendency would still be the same; He would\\r\\nonly lead us into it to give us the opportunity for struggle and victory,\\r\\nand therefore in order that virtue might exist; the possibility of sin is\\r\\nthe condition of virtue, and in consequence, even in the admission of this\\r\\npossibility and above all by its admission, God is virtuous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bad deed, furthermore, is not the most considerable from the point of\\r\\nview of guilt; as merit or demerit the intention is worth as much as the\\r\\ndeed and he is criminal who has had the intention to be so (which is\\r\\nclearly according to the Gospel).\\r\\n\\r\\nHUGO DE SAINT-VICTOR; RICHARD.--Abelard possessed perhaps the\\r\\nbroadest and greatest mind of the whole of the Middle Ages. After these\\r\\nfamous names must be mentioned Hugo de Saint-Victor, a somewhat obscure\\r\\nmystic of German origin; and the not less mystical Richard, who, thoroughly\\r\\npersuaded that God is not attained by reason but by feeling, taught\\r\\nexaltation to Him by detachment from self and by six degrees: renunciation,\\r\\nelevation, impulsion, precipitation, ecstasy, and absorption.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluence of Aristotle\\r\\nHis Adoption by the Church.\\r\\nReligious Philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nARISTOTLE AND THE CHURCH.--From the thirteenth century, Aristotle,\\r\\ncompletely known and translated into Latin, was adopted by the Church and\\r\\nbecame in some sort its lay vicar. He was regarded, and I think rightly, as\\r\\nof all the Greek thinkers the least dangerous to her and as the one to whom\\r\\ncould be left all the scientific instruction whilst she reserved to herself\\r\\nall the religious teaching. Aristotle, in fact, \"defended her from Plato,\"\\r\\nin whom were always found some germs of adoration of this world, or some\\r\\ntendencies in this direction, in whom was also found a certain polytheism\\r\\nmuch disguised, or rather much purified, but actual and dangerous;\\r\\ntherefore, from the moment when it became necessary to select, Aristotle\\r\\nwas tolerated and finally invested with office.\\r\\n\\r\\nST. THOMAS AQUINAS.--As Aristotelian theologians must be cited\\r\\nWilliam of Auvergne, Vincent of Beauvais, Albertus Magnus; but the\\r\\nsovereign name of this period of the history of philosophy is St. Thomas\\r\\nAquinas. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote several small works but, surpassing them\\r\\nall, the _Summa_ (encyclopaedia) which bears his name. In general\\r\\nphilosophy St. Thomas Aquinas is an Aristotelian, bending but not\\r\\ndistorting the ideas of Aristotle to Christian conceptions. Like\\r\\nAristotle, he demonstrated God by the existence of motion and the necessity\\r\\nof a first motive power; he further demonstrated it by the contingent,\\r\\nrelative, and imperfect character of all here below: \"There is in things\\r\\nmore or less goodness, more or less truth.\" But we only affirm the more or\\r\\nless of a thing by comparing it with something absolute and as it\\r\\napproaches more or less to this absolute; there is therefore an absolute\\r\\nbeing, namely God--and this argument appeared to him better than that of\\r\\nSt. Anselm, which he refuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS CONCEPTION OF NATURE.--He showed the whole of nature as a great\\r\\nhierarchy, proceeding from the least perfect and the most shapeless to the\\r\\nmost complete and determinate; from another aspect, as separated into two\\r\\ngreat kingdoms, that of necessity (mineral, vegetable, animal), and that of\\r\\ngrace (humanity). He displayed it willed by God, projected by God, created\\r\\nby God; governed by God according to antecedent and consequent wills, that\\r\\nis, by general wills (God desires man to be saved) and by particular wills\\r\\n(God wishes the sinner to be punished), and the union of the general wills\\r\\nis the creation, and the result of all the particular wills is\\r\\nProvidence. Nature and man with it are the work not only of the power but\\r\\nof the goodness of God, and it is by love that He created us and we must\\r\\nrender Him love for love, which is involuntarily done by Nature herself in\\r\\nher obedience to His laws, and which we must do voluntarily by obedience to\\r\\nHis commandments.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SOUL.--Our soul is immaterial and more complete than that of\\r\\nanimals, for St. Thomas does not formally deny that animals have souls; the\\r\\ninstinct of animals is the sensitive soul according to Aristotle, which is\\r\\ncapable of four faculties: sensibility, imagination, memory, and\\r\\nestimation, that is elementary intelligence: \"The bird picks up straw, not\\r\\nbecause it gratifies her feelings [not by a movement of sensibility], but\\r\\nbecause it serves to make her nest. It is therefore necessary that an\\r\\nanimal should perceive those intuitions which do not come within the scope\\r\\nof the senses. It is by opinion or estimation that it perceives these\\r\\nintuitions, these distant ends.\" We, mankind, possess a soul which is\\r\\nsensibility, imagination, memory, and reason. Reason is the faculty not\\r\\nonly of having ideas, but of establishing connections and chains of\\r\\nconnection between the ideas and of conceiving general ideas. Reason pauses\\r\\nbefore reaching God because the idea of God precisely is the only one which\\r\\ncannot be brought to the mind by the interrelation of ideas, for God\\r\\nsurpasses all ideas; the idea of God is given by faith, which can be\\r\\nsubsequently helped by reason, for the latter can work to make faith\\r\\nperceptible to reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur soul is full of passions, divisible into two great categories, the\\r\\npassions of desire and those of anger. The passions of desire are rapid or\\r\\nviolent movements towards some object which seems to us a good; the\\r\\npassions of anger are movements of revolt against something which opposes\\r\\nour movement towards a good. The common root of all the passions is love,\\r\\nfor it is obvious that from it are derived the passions of desire; and as\\r\\nfor the passions of wrath they would not exist if we had no love of\\r\\nanything, in which case our desire not coming into collision would not turn\\r\\ninto revolt against the obstacle. We are free to do good or evil, to master\\r\\nour evil passions and to follow those of which reason approves. Here\\r\\nreappears the objection of the knowledge God must have beforehand of our\\r\\nactions: if God foresees our actions we are not free; if free, we act\\r\\ncontrary to his previsions, then He is not all-powerful. St. Thomas makes\\r\\nanswer thus: \"There is not prevision, there is vision, because we are in\\r\\ntime whereas God is in eternity. He sees at one glance and instantaneously\\r\\nall the past, present, and future. Therefore, He does not foresee but see,\\r\\nand this vision does not hinder human freedom any more than being seen\\r\\nacting prevents one from acting. Because God knows our deeds after they are\\r\\ndone, no one can plead that that prevents our full liberty to do them; if\\r\\nHe knew them before it is the same as knowing them after, because for Him\\r\\npast, present, and future are all the same moment.\" This appears subtle but\\r\\nis not, for it only amounts to the statement that in speaking of God time\\r\\nmust not be mentioned, for God is as much outside time as outside space.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MORAL SYSTEM OF ST. THOMAS.--The very detailed and\\r\\ncircumstantial moral system of St. Thomas may thus be summarized: there is\\r\\nin conscience, first, an intellectual act which is the distinction between\\r\\ngood and evil; secondly, an act of will which leads us to the good. This\\r\\npower for good urges the practice of virtue. There are human virtues, well\\r\\nknown to the ancient philosophers, temperance, courage, wisdom, justice,\\r\\nwhich lead to happiness on earth; there are divine virtues, inspired in man\\r\\nby God, which are faith, hope, and charity, and they lead to eternal\\r\\nhappiness. We practise the virtues, when we are well-disposed, because we\\r\\nare free; but our liberty and our will do not suffice; it is necessary for\\r\\nGod to help us, and that is \"grace.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFAITH AND REASON.--On the question of the relation of reason to\\r\\nfaith, St. Thomas Aquinas recognizes, or rather proclaims, that reason will\\r\\nnever demonstrate faith, that the revealed truths, the Trinity, original\\r\\nsin, grace, etc., are above reason and infinitely exceed it. How, then, can\\r\\none believe? By will, aided by the grace of God. Then henceforth must no\\r\\nappeal be made to reason? Yes, indeed! Reason serves to refute the errors\\r\\nof the adversaries of the faith, and by this refutation to confirm itself\\r\\nin belief. The famous _Credo ut intelligam_--I believe in order to\\r\\nunderstand--is therefore true. Comprehension is only possible on condition\\r\\nof belief; but subsequently comprehension helps to believe, if not more, at\\r\\nleast with a greater precision and in a more abundant light. St. Thomas\\r\\nAquinas here is in exactly the position which Pascal seems to have taken\\r\\nup: Believe and you will understand; understand and you will believe more\\r\\nexactly. Therefore an act of will: \"I wish to believe\"--a grace of God\\r\\nfortifying this will: faith exists--studies and reasoning: faith is the\\r\\nclearer.\\r\\n\\r\\nST. BONAVENTURA; RAYMOND LULLE.--Beside these men of the highest\\r\\nbrain-power there are found in the thirteenth century mystics, that is,\\r\\npoets and eccentrics, both by the way most interesting. It was St.\\r\\nBonaventura who, being persuaded, almost like an Alexandrine, that one\\r\\nrises to God by synthetic feeling and not by series of arguments, and that\\r\\none journeys towards Him by successive states of the soul each more pure\\r\\nand more passionate--wrote _The Journey of the Soul to God_, which is,\\r\\nso to speak, a manual of mysticism. Learned as he was, whilst pursuing his\\r\\nown purpose, he digressed in agreeable and instructive fashion into the\\r\\nrealms of real knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWidely different from him, Raymond Lulle or de Lulle, an unbridled\\r\\nschoolman, in his _Ars magna_ invented a reasoning machine, analogous\\r\\nto an arithmetical machine, in which ideas were automatically deduced from\\r\\none another as the figures inscribe themselves on a counter. As often\\r\\nhappens, the excess of the method was its own criticism, and an enemy of\\r\\nscholasticism could not have more ingeniously demonstrated that it was a\\r\\nkind of mechanism. Raymond de Lulle was at once a learned man and a\\r\\nwell-informed and most enquiring naturalist for whom Arabian science held\\r\\nno secrets. With that he was poet, troubadour, orator, as well as very\\r\\neccentric and attractive. He was beloved and persecuted in his lifetime,\\r\\nand long after his death still found enthusiastic disciples.\\r\\n\\r\\nBACON.--Contemporaneously lived the man whom it is generally the\\r\\ncustom to regard as the distant precursor of experimental science, Roger\\r\\nBacon (who must not be confused with Francis Bacon, another learned man who\\r\\nlived much nearer to our own time). Roger Bacon, a Franciscan friar,\\r\\noccupied himself almost exclusively with physical and natural science. He\\r\\npassed the greater portion of his life in prison by reason of alleged\\r\\nsorcery and, more especially, perhaps, because he had denounced the evil\\r\\nlives of his brethren. He had at least a presentiment of almost all modern\\r\\ninventions: gunpowder, magnifying glass, telescope, air-pump; he was\\r\\ndistinctly an inventor in optics. In philosophy, properly speaking, he\\r\\ndenounced what was hollow and empty in scholasticism, detesting that\\r\\npreference should be given to \"the straw of words rather than to the grain\\r\\nof fact,\" and proclaiming that reasoning \"is good to conclude but not to\\r\\nestablish.\" Without discovering the law of progress, as has too often been\\r\\nalleged, he arrived at the conclusion that antiquity being the youth of the\\r\\nworld, the moderns are the adults, which only meant that it would be at our\\r\\nschool that the ancients would learn were they to return to earth and that\\r\\nwe ought not to believe blindly in the ancients; and this was an\\r\\ninsurrection against the principle of authority and against the idolatry of\\r\\nAristotle. He preached the direct study of nature, observation, and\\r\\nexperiment with the subsequent application of deduction, and especially of\\r\\nmathematical deduction, to experiment and observation. With all that, he\\r\\nbelieved in astrology; for those who are in advance of their time none the\\r\\nless belong to it: but he was a very great man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDecadence of Scholasticism. Forebodings of the Coming\\r\\nEra. Great Moralists. The Kabbala. Sorcery.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDECADENCE OF SCHOLASTICISM.--The fourteenth century dated the\\r\\ndecadence of scholasticism, but saw little new. \"Realism\" was generally\\r\\nabandoned, and the field was swept by \"nominalism,\" which was the theory\\r\\nthat ideas only have existence in the brains which conceive them. Thus\\r\\nDurand de Saint-Pour\\xc3\\xa7ain remains famous for having said, \"To exist is to be\\r\\nindividually,\" which at that epoch was very audacious. William of Ockham\\r\\nrepeated the phrase with emphasis; there is nothing real except the\\r\\nindividual. That went so far as to cast suspicion on all metaphysics, and\\r\\nsomewhat on theology. In fact, _although a devout believer_, Ockham\\r\\nrejected theology, implored the Church not to be learned, because her\\r\\nscience proved nothing, and to content herself with faith: \"Science belongs\\r\\nto God, faith to men.\" But, or rather in addition, if the ministers of God\\r\\nwere no longer imposing because of their ambitious science, it was\\r\\nnecessary for them to regain their sway over souls by other and better\\r\\nmeans. It was incumbent on them to be saintly, to revert to the purity, the\\r\\nsimplicity, and the divine childishness of the primitive Church; and here\\r\\nhe was virtually a forerunner of the Reformation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOckham was indeed one of the auxiliaries of Philip the Fair in his struggle\\r\\nwith the Holy See, suffered excommunication, and sought refuge with the\\r\\nDuke of Bavaria, the foe of the Pope.\\r\\n\\r\\nBURIDAN: THE LIBERTY OF INDIFFERENCE.--Realists and nominalists\\r\\ncontinued their mutual strife, sometimes physically even, until the middle\\r\\nof the fifteenth century. But nominalism always gained ground, having\\r\\namong other celebrated champions, Peter d\\'Ailly and Buridan; the one\\r\\nsucceeded in becoming Chancellor of the University of Paris, the other in\\r\\nbecoming its Rector. Buridan has remained famous through his death and his\\r\\ndonkey, both alike legendary. According to a ballad by Villon, Buridan\\r\\nhaving been too tenderly loved by Joan of Navarre, wife of Philip the Fair,\\r\\nwas by his order \"thrown in a sack into the Seine.\" By comparison of\\r\\ndates, the fact seems impossible. According to tradition, either in order\\r\\nto show the freedom of indifference, or that animals are mere machines,\\r\\nBuridan declared that an ass with two baskets full of corn placed one on\\r\\neach side of him and at equal distance from him, would never decide from\\r\\nwhich he should feed and would die of starvation. Nothing of the kind is to\\r\\nbe found in his works, but he may have said so in a lecture and his pupils\\r\\nremembering it have handed it down as a proverb.\\r\\n\\r\\nPETER D\\'AILLY; GERSON.--Peter d\\'Ailly, a highly important\\r\\necclesiastic, head of the College of Navarre, chevalier of the University\\r\\nof Paris, Cardinal, a leader in the discussions at the Councils at Pisa and\\r\\nConstance, a drastic reformer of the morals and customs of the Church, did\\r\\nnot evince any marked originality as a philosopher, but maintained the\\r\\nalready known doctrines of nominalism with extraordinary dialectical skill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong his pupils he numbered Gerson, who was also Chancellor of the\\r\\nUniversity of Paris, another highly zealous and energetic reformer, a more\\r\\navowed enemy of scholasticism and mysticism, of exaggerated austerity and\\r\\nastrology, eminently modern in the best sense of the word, whose political\\r\\nand religious enemies are his title of respect. He was the author of many\\r\\nsmall books devoted to the popularization of science, religion, and\\r\\nmorality. To him was long attributed the _Imitation of Jesus Christ_,\\r\\nwhich on the whole bears no resemblance to his writings, but which he might\\r\\nvery well have written in old age in his retreat in the peaceful silence of\\r\\nthe Celestines of Lyons.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE KABBALA.--From the beginning of the fifteenth century the\\r\\nRenaissance was heralded by a revival of Platonism, both in philosophy and\\r\\nliterature. But it was a Platonism strangely understood, a quaint medley of\\r\\nPythagoreanism and Alexandrinism, the source of which is not very clear\\r\\n(the period not having been much studied). Then arose an incredible\\r\\ninfatuation for the Kabbala--a doctrine which was for a long while the\\r\\nsecret of the Jews, brooded over by them so to speak during the darkness of\\r\\nthe Middle Ages, in which are to be found traces of the most sublime\\r\\nspeculations and of the basest superstitions of antiquity. It contained a\\r\\nkind of pantheistic theology closely analogous to those of Porphyry and\\r\\nIamblichus, as well as processes of magic mingled with astrology. The\\r\\nKabbalists believe that the sage, who by his astrological knowledge is\\r\\nbrought into relation with the celestial powers, can affect nature, alter\\r\\nthe course of phenomena, and work miracles. The Kabbala forms part of the\\r\\nhistory of the marvelous and of occult science rather than of the history\\r\\nof philosophy. Nevertheless men of real learning were initiated and were\\r\\ninfatuated, among them the marvelous Pico della Mirandola, Reuchlin, not\\r\\nless remarkable as humanist and Hebraist, who would have run grave risk at\\r\\nthe hands of the Inquisition at Cologne if he had not been saved by Leo\\r\\nX. Cardan, a mathematician and physician, was one of the learned men of the\\r\\nday most impregnated with Kabbalism. He believed in a kind of infallibility\\r\\nof the inner sense, of the intuition, and regarded as futile all sciences\\r\\nthat proceeded by slow rational operations. He believed himself a mage and\\r\\nmagician. From vanity he spoke of himself in the highest terms and from\\r\\ncynicism in the lowest. Doubt has been cast on his sincerity and also on\\r\\nhis sanity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAGIC.--There were also Paracelsus and Agrippa. Paracelsus, like\\r\\nCardan, believed in an intense light infinitely superior to bestial\\r\\nreasoning and calls to mind certain philosophy of intuition of the present\\r\\nday. He too believed himself a magician and physician, and effected cures\\r\\nby the application of astrology to therapeutics. Agrippa did the same with\\r\\nyet stranger phantasies, passing from absolute scepticism through mysticism\\r\\nto magi and demonology; in his own time and in subsequent centuries\\r\\nenjoying the reputation of a devil incarnate as man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt Is Fairly Accurate to Consider that from the Point of\\r\\nView of Philosophy, the Middle Ages Lasted until Descartes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree-thinkers More or Less Disguised.\\r\\n\\r\\nPartisans of Reason Apart from Faith, of Observation,\\r\\nand Of Experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FREEDOM OF PHILOSOPHY: POMPONAZZO.--The freedom and even the\\r\\naudacity of philosophy rapidly increased. Learned and convinced\\r\\nAristotelians were bent, either from sheer love of truth or from a more\\r\\nsecret purpose, on demonstrating to what extent Aristotle, accurately read,\\r\\nwas opposed to the teaching of the Church. For instance, Pomponazzo\\r\\nrevealed that nothing could be drawn from Aristotle in favour of the\\r\\nimmortality of the soul, in which he himself believed fervently, but in\\r\\nwhich Aristotle did not believe, hence it was necessary to choose between\\r\\nthe Church and Aristotle; that without the immortality of the soul there\\r\\ncould be no rewards beyond the grave, which was entirely his own opinion,\\r\\nbut whoever should desire to offer excuses for Aristotle could say it was\\r\\nprecisely the existence of punishments and rewards which deprived virtue of\\r\\nexistence, which did away with virtue, since the good that is done for the\\r\\nsake of reward or from fear of punishment is no longer good; that, still\\r\\naccording to Aristotle, there could never be miracles; that he, Pomponazzo,\\r\\nbelieved in all the miracles recorded in the Scriptures; but that Aristotle\\r\\nwould not have believed in them, and could not have believed in them, a\\r\\nfact which demanded consideration, not assuredly in order to reject belief\\r\\nin miracles, but in order not to bestow on Aristotle that confidence which\\r\\nfor so long had been too readily placed in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same way, he took up again the eternal question of the prescience of\\r\\nGod and of human liberty, and showed that no matter what had been said it\\r\\nwas necessary to choose: either we are free and God is not omnipotent, or\\r\\nGod is omnipotent and we are not free. To regard as true this latter\\r\\nhypothesis, towards which the philosopher evidently leans, would cause God\\r\\nto be the author of evil and of sin. It would not be impossible for God to\\r\\nbe the author of evil as an essential condition of good, for if evil were\\r\\nnot to exist then there could not be good; nor would it be impossible that\\r\\nHe should be the author, not of sin, but of the possibility of sin in order\\r\\nthat virtue might be possible, there being no virtue where it is impossible\\r\\nto commit sin; but therein lies a mystery which faith alone can solve, and\\r\\nwhich Aristotle at any rate has not solved, therefore let us not place\\r\\nreliance on Aristotle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis disguised freethinker, for he does not appear to me to be anything\\r\\nelse, was one of the most original thinkers of the period intermediate\\r\\nbetween the Middle Ages and Descartes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMICHAEL SERVETUS; VANINI.--Such instances of temerity were sometimes\\r\\nfatal to their authors. Michael Servetus, a very learned Spanish physician\\r\\nwho perhaps discovered the circulation of the blood before Harvey,\\r\\ndisbelieved in the Trinity and in the divinity of Jesus, and, as he was a\\r\\nPlatonist, perceived no intermediaries between God and man save\\r\\nideas. Persecuted by the Catholics, he sought refuge at Geneva, believing\\r\\nCalvin to be more merciful than the Inquisitors, and Calvin burned him\\r\\nalive.\\r\\n\\r\\nVanini, half a century later, that is at the commencement of the\\r\\nseventeenth, a restless, vain, and insolent man, after a life full of\\r\\nsudden changes of fortune, and yet distinguished, was burnt alive at\\r\\nToulouse for certain passages in his _De admirandis ... arcanis_, and\\r\\nfor having said that he would not express his opinion on the immortality of\\r\\nthe soul until he was old, a Jew, and a German.\\r\\n\\r\\nBRUNO; CAMPANELLA.--Giordano Bruno, an astronomer and one of the\\r\\nfirst to affirm that the sun was the centre of the world, professed,\\r\\ndespite certain precautions, a doctrine which confused God with the world\\r\\nand denied or excluded creation. Giordano Bruno was arrested at Venice in\\r\\n1593, kept seven years in prison, and finally burnt at Rome in 1600.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampanella, likewise an Italian, who spent twenty-seven years in a dungeon\\r\\nfor having conspired against the Spanish masters of his country, and who\\r\\ndied in exile in Paris in 1639, was a sceptic in philosophy, or rather an\\r\\nanti-metaphysician, and, as would be said nowadays, a positivist. There are\\r\\nonly two sources of knowledge, observation and reasoning. Observation makes\\r\\nus know things--is this true? May not the sensations of things which we\\r\\nhave be a simple phantasmagoria? No; for we have an internal sense, a sense\\r\\nof our own, which cannot deceive us, which affirms our existence (here is\\r\\nthe _Cogito_ of Descartes anticipated) and which, at the same time,\\r\\naffirms that there are things which are not ourselves, so that coincidently\\r\\nthe ego and the non-ego are established. Yes, but is this non-ego really\\r\\nwhat it seems? It is; granted; but what is it and can we know what it is?\\r\\nNot without doubt, and here scepticism is unshakable; but in that there is\\r\\ncertitude of the existence of the non-ego, the presumption is that we can\\r\\nknow it, partially, relatively, very relatively, while we remain infinitely\\r\\ndistant from an absolute knowledge, which would be divine. Therefore let us\\r\\nobserve and experiment; let us make the \"history\" of nature as historians\\r\\nmake the history of the human race. And this is the simple and solid\\r\\nphilosophy of experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Campanella, like so many more, was a metaphysician possessed by the\\r\\ndevil of metaphysics, and after having imperiously recommended the writing\\r\\nof only the history of nature, he himself wrote its romance as well. Every\\r\\nbeing, he said (and the thought was a very fine one), exists on condition\\r\\nof being able to exist, and on condition that there be an idea of which it\\r\\nis the realization, and again on condition that nature is willing to create\\r\\nit. In other words, nature can, knows what she wishes, and wishes. Now all\\r\\nbeings, in a greater or less degree according to their perfection or\\r\\nimperfection, feel this triple condition of being able, knowing, and\\r\\nwishing. Every being can, knows, and wishes, even inorganic matter (here\\r\\nalready is the world as will and representation of Schopenhauer), and God\\r\\nis only absolute power, absolute knowledge, and absolute will. This is why\\r\\nall creative things gravitate to God and desire to return to Him as to\\r\\ntheir origin, and as the perfection of what they are: the universe has\\r\\nnostalgia for God.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampanella was also, as we should say nowadays, a sociologist. He made his\\r\\n\"Republic\" as Plato had made his. The Republic of Campanella was called the\\r\\n_City of the Sun_. It was a community republic, leavened with\\r\\naristocracy with \"spiritual power\" and \"temporal power\" somewhat after the\\r\\nmanner of Auguste Comte. Campanella was a great sower of ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRANCIS BACON.--Francis Bacon, lawyer, member of Parliament, Lord\\r\\nChancellor of England, personal friend of James I, friend, protector, and\\r\\nperhaps collaborator with Shakespeare, overthrown as the result of\\r\\npolitical animosity and relegated to private life, was a very learned man\\r\\nwith a marvellous mind. Like his namesake, Roger Bacon, but in an age more\\r\\nfavourable to intellectual reform, he attempted a sort of renewal of the\\r\\nhuman mind (_Instauratio Magna_) or at least a radical revolution in\\r\\nthe methods and workings of the human mind. Although Francis Bacon\\r\\nprofessed admiration for many of the thinkers of antiquity, he urged that\\r\\nit was wrong to rely on them because they had not sufficiently observed;\\r\\none must not, like the schoolmen, have ideas _a priori_, which are\\r\\n\"idols,\" and there are idols of tribe, of party, of school, of eras;\\r\\nintentions must not be perceived everywhere in nature, and we must not,\\r\\nbecause the sun warms, believe it was created to warm, or because the earth\\r\\nyields nourishment believe her creation was for the purpose of feeding us,\\r\\nand that all things converge to man and are put at his service. It is\\r\\nnecessary to proceed by observation, by experiment, and then by induction,\\r\\nbut with prodigious mistrust of induction. Induction consists in drawing\\r\\nconclusions from the particular to the general, from a certain number of\\r\\nfacts to a law. This is legitimate on condition that the conclusion is not\\r\\ndrawn from a few facts to a law, which is precipitate induction, fruitful\\r\\nin errors; but from a very large number of facts to a law, which even then\\r\\nis considered as provisional. As for metaphysics, as for the investigation\\r\\nof universal law, that should be entirely separated from philosophy itself,\\r\\nfrom the \"primary philosophy\" which does not lead to it; it has its own\\r\\nfield, which is that of faith: \"Give to faith what belongeth to faith.\" In\\r\\nthe main he is uninterested in metaphysics, believing them always to\\r\\nrevolve in a circle and, I do not say, only believes in science and in\\r\\nmethod, but has hope only from knowledge and method, an enthusiast in this\\r\\nrespect just as another might be about the super-sensible world or about\\r\\nideas, saying human knowledge and human power are really coincident, and\\r\\nbelieving that knowledge will support humanity in all calamities, will\\r\\nprolong human life, will establish a new golden age, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, let there be none of that eternal and unfounded fear that\\r\\nknowledge will cause the disappearance of the religious feeling. With\\r\\nprofound conviction and judging by himself, Bacon said: \"A little\\r\\nphilosophy inclineth a man\\'s mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy\\r\\nbringeth a man\\'s mind about to religion.\" Such is true philosophy,\\r\\n\"subordinate to the object,\" attentive to the object, listening to the\\r\\nvoices of the world and only anxious to translate them into human language:\\r\\n\"that is true philosophy which renders the voices of the world the most\\r\\naccurately possible, like an echo, which writes as if at the dictation of\\r\\nthe world itself, adding nothing of its own, only repeating and\\r\\n_resounding_.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as a man is always of his time, he believed in alchemy and in the\\r\\npossibility of transmuting base metals into gold. But note how he\\r\\nunderstood it: \"To create a new nature in a given body or to produce new\\r\\nnatures and to introduce them ... he who is acquainted with the forms and\\r\\nmodes of super-inducing yellowness, weight, ductility, fixity, fluidity,\\r\\nsolution, and the rest, with their gradations and methods, will see and\\r\\ntake care that these properties be united in some body, whence its\\r\\ntransformation into gold may follow.\" Modern chemistry, with scientific\\r\\nmethods highly analogous to those which Bacon indicated or foresaw, has not\\r\\nmade gold, which is not a very useful thing to do, but has done better.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHOMAS HOBBES.--At the end of the sixteenth century, another\\r\\nEnglishman, Thomas Hobbes, began to think. He was, above all else, a\\r\\nliterary man and a sociologist; he translated Thucydides and Homer, he\\r\\nwrote _Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth_,\\r\\nwhich is a manual of despotism, demonstrating that all men in a natural\\r\\nstate were beasts of prey with regard to one another, but that they escaped\\r\\nthis unpleasant fate by submission to a prince who has all rights because\\r\\nhe is perpetually saving his subjects from death, and who can therefore\\r\\nimpose on them whatever he pleases, even scientific dogma or religious\\r\\nbeliefs. Merely regarded as a philosopher, properly so called, Hobbes has\\r\\nan important position in the history of ideas. Like Francis Bacon, but more\\r\\nrigorously and authoritatively, he began by separating metaphysics and\\r\\ntheology from philosophy. Philosophy is the art of thinking. That which is\\r\\nnot sensible--mind, soul, God--cannot be thought: can only be believed;\\r\\nphilosophy does not deny all that; merely it does not concern itself\\r\\ntherewith. Here is the whole of positivism established in principle. What\\r\\nwe can think is what we feel. Things are known to us only through\\r\\nsensations; a thought is a sensation, the human mind is a compound of\\r\\nsensations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo; for I can think of a thing without hearing, seeing, feeling it, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is because we have memory, which is itself a sensation; it is a\\r\\nsensation which prolongs itself; to remember is to feel that one has felt;\\r\\nit is to feel a former sensation which the brain is able to preserve. We\\r\\nthink only by combining current sensations with other current sensations,\\r\\nor much more often indeed, thanks to memory, by combining current\\r\\nsensations with older ones, or former sensations with each other. This is\\r\\nbut a fragile basis for knowledge and thought, for sensation is only a\\r\\nmodification of ourselves caused by an external object, and consequently\\r\\ngives us nothing at all of the external object, and of itself the external\\r\\nworld is eternally unknown to us; but we combine with each other the\\r\\nillusions that the external world deposits in us through the delusive or\\r\\ndoubtful intermediary of our senses.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sensation thus combined with other sensations has become thought,\\r\\nthen ideas begin to exist. They are products of sensation detached from\\r\\nsensation. They are interassociated by laws that are obscure, yet which can\\r\\nbe vaguely perceived. They awake, so to speak, and call to one another;\\r\\nevery time an idea previously acquired reappears, it is followed by the\\r\\nthought which accompanied it when it was acquired. In a conversation a\\r\\ntraitor is spoken of. Someone asks what was the value of a piece of silver\\r\\nin ancient times. This appears incoherent; really it is a natural and\\r\\nsimple association of ideas in which there are few intermediate steps. The\\r\\nperson who listened as the traitor was mentioned thought of Judas, who was\\r\\nthe first traitor of whom he had heard, and of the thirty pieces of silver,\\r\\nthe price of the betrayal by Judas. The association of ideas is more or\\r\\nless close, more or less loose; it is disconnected in dreams, irregular in\\r\\nmusing, close directly it is dominated and in consequence directed by an\\r\\nend pursued, by a goal sought; for then there is a desire to attain which\\r\\nassociates nothing of itself, but which, eliminating all ideas that are not\\r\\npertinent to the end pursued, permits only the association of those which\\r\\nhave relation to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing in the human soul only successive impulses arising from those first\\r\\nimpulses which are the sensations, Hobbes does not believe we are free to\\r\\ndo what we wish; we are carried away by the strongest impulse of our\\r\\ninternal impulses, desire, fear, aversion, love, etc. Nevertheless we\\r\\ndeliberate, we consider different courses to pursue and we decide on the\\r\\none we desire to choose. No; we do not deliberate, we only imagine we\\r\\ndeliberate. Deliberation is only a succession of different feelings, and to\\r\\nthe one that gains the day we give the name of volition. \"In the\\r\\n[so-called] deliberation, the final desire or the final fear is called\\r\\nwill.\" Therefore liberty has no more existence among men than among\\r\\nanimals; will and desire are only one and the same thing considered under\\r\\ndifferent aspects.\\r\\n\\r\\nUTILITARIAN MORALITY.--Henceforth there is no morality; without the\\r\\npower to will this and not to will that, there is no possible\\r\\nmorality. Hobbes retorts with \"utilitarian morality\": What man should seek\\r\\nis pleasure, as Aristippus thought; but true pleasure--that which is\\r\\npermanent and that which is useful to him. Now it is useful to be a good\\r\\ncitizen, a loyal subject, sociable, serviceable to others, careful to\\r\\nobtain their esteem by good conduct, etc. Morality is interest rightly\\r\\nunderstood, and interest rightly understood is absolutely blended with the\\r\\nmorality of duty. The criminal is not a criminal but an idiot; the honest\\r\\nman is not an honest man but an intelligent one. Observe that a man is\\r\\nhardly convinced when preached to in the name of duty, but always convinced\\r\\nwhen addressed in the name of his own interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this is fairly sensible; but from the time that freedom ceases there\\r\\ncan be no morality, _not even utilitarian_; for it is useless even\\r\\nfrom the point of view of his own interests, to preach to a man who is only\\r\\na machine moved by the strongest force; and, if he be only that, to lay\\r\\ndown a moral code for him either from the point of view of his own\\r\\ninterests, or from that of morality, or from that of the love of God are\\r\\nthings which are the same and which are as absurd the one as the other. All\\r\\nphilosophy, which does not believe in human liberty, yet which enunciates a\\r\\nsystem of morality, is in perpetual contradiction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART III\\r\\n\\r\\nMODERN TIMES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDescartes. Cartesianism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDESCARTES.--The seventeenth century, which was the greatest\\r\\nphilosophic century of modern times and perhaps of any time, began with\\r\\nRen\\xc3\\xa9 Descartes. Descartes, born at La Haye in Touraine in 1596, of noble\\r\\nfamily (his real name was des Quartes), was educated by the Jesuits of the\\r\\ncollege of La Fl\\xc3\\xa8che, followed the military profession for several years,\\r\\nthen gave himself up to mathematics and became one of the greatest\\r\\nmathematicians of Europe, traveled all over Europe for his own amusement\\r\\nand instruction, wrote scientific and philosophical works, of which the\\r\\nmost famous are the _Discourse on_ METHOD, the _Meditations_, and\\r\\nthe _Rules for the Control of the Mind_, resided sometimes in Paris,\\r\\nsometimes in Holland, and finally, at fifty-four years of age, unhappily\\r\\nattracted by the flattering invitations of Queen Christina of Sweden,\\r\\nproceeded to Stockholm, where he succumbed in four months to the severity\\r\\nof the climate. He died in February, 1650.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SYSTEM OF DESCARTES.--In the works of Descartes there are a\\r\\ngeneral system of philosophy, a psychology, and a method. This order is\\r\\nhere adopted because of the three, in Descartes; it is the third which is\\r\\nthe most important, and which has left the most profound traces. The\\r\\nfoundation of the system of Descartes is belief in God and in the goodness\\r\\nof God. I say the foundation and not the starting-point. The starting-point\\r\\nis another matter; but it will be clearly seen that the foundation is what\\r\\nhas just been stated. The starting-point is this: I do not believe,\\r\\nprovisionally, in anything, not wishing to take into account what I have\\r\\nbeen taught. I doubt everything. Is there anything I cannot doubt? It\\r\\nseems to me there is: I cannot doubt that I doubt. Now if I doubt, I\\r\\nthink; if I think, I am. There is one certainty, I am.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd having arrived there, Descartes is at a dead stop, for from the\\r\\ncertitude of one\\'s own existence nothing can be deduced save the certitude\\r\\nof one\\'s existence. For instance, shall I believe in the existence of\\r\\neverything that is not myself? There is no reason why I should believe in\\r\\nit. The world may be a dream. But if I believe in God and in a God of\\r\\nperfect goodness, I can then believe in something outside of myself, for\\r\\nGod not being able to deceive Himself or me, if He permits me to see the\\r\\nexternal world, it is because this external world exists. There are\\r\\nalready, therefore, three things in which I believe: my own existence, that\\r\\nof God, and that of the universe. Which of these beliefs is the fundamental\\r\\none? Evidently, the one not demonstrated; the axiom is that upon which one\\r\\nrests to demonstrate everything except itself. Now of the three things in\\r\\nwhich Descartes believed, his own existence is demonstrated by the\\r\\nimpossibility of thinking or feeling, without feeling his own existence;\\r\\nthe other is demonstrated by the existence of a good God; the existence of\\r\\na good God is demonstrated by nothing. It is believed. Hence belief in a\\r\\ngood God is Descartes\\' foundation. This has not been introduced in order\\r\\nthat he may escape from the _I am_ at which he came to a stop; that\\r\\nbelief certainly existed previously, and if he had recourse to it, it was\\r\\nbecause it existed first. Without that, he had too much intellectual\\r\\nhonesty to invent it for a particular need. He had it, and he found it as\\r\\nit were in reserve when he asked himself if he could go beyond _I\\r\\nam_. Here was his foundation; all the rest would complete the proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE EXISTENCE OF GOD.--Although Descartes rests on God as being his\\r\\nfirst principle, he does not fail to prove His existence, and that is\\r\\nbegging the question, something proved by what has to be proved. For if\\r\\nDescartes believed only in something outside himself because of a good God,\\r\\nthat Being outside himself, God, he can prove only because of the existence\\r\\nof a good God, who cannot deceive us, and thus is God proved by the belief\\r\\nin Him. That is begging the question. Descartes does not fail to prove the\\r\\nexistence of God by superabundance as it were; and this, too, in itself\\r\\nindicates clearly that faith in God is the very foundation of the\\r\\nphilosophy of Descartes. After having taken it as the basis of reasoning,\\r\\nhe takes it as the goal of reasoning, which indicates that the idea of God,\\r\\nso to speak, encircled his mind and that he found it at every ultimate\\r\\npoint of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe proves it, therefore, first by an argument analogous to that of\\r\\nSt. Anselm, which is this: we, imperfect and finite, have the idea of a\\r\\nperfect and infinite Being; we are not capable of this idea. Therefore it\\r\\nmust have come to us from a Being really perfect and infinite, and hence\\r\\nthis perfect Being exists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother proof, that of God regarded as cause. First: I exist. Who made me?\\r\\nWas it myself? No, if it had been myself I should have endowed myself with\\r\\nall the perfections of which I can conceive and in which I am singularly\\r\\ndeficient. Therefore it must be some other being who created me. It was my\\r\\nparents. No doubt, but who created my parents and the parents of my\\r\\nparents? One cannot go back indefinitely from cause to cause, and there\\r\\nmust have been a first one.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: even my own actual existence, my existence at this very moment,\\r\\nis it the result of my existence yesterday? Nothing proves it, and there is\\r\\nno necessity because I existed just now that I should exist at\\r\\npresent. There must therefore be a cause at each moment and a continuous\\r\\ncause. That continuous cause is God, and the whole world is a creation\\r\\nperpetually continued, and is only comprehensible as continuous creation\\r\\nand is only explicable by a Creator.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WORLD.--Thus sure of himself, of God, and of the world,\\r\\nDescartes studies the world and himself. In the world he sees souls and\\r\\nmatter; matter is substance in extensions, souls are substance not in\\r\\nextension, spiritual substance. The extended substance is endowed with\\r\\nimpulse. Is the impulse self-generated, are the bodies self-impelled? No,\\r\\nthey are moved. What is the primary motive force? It is God. Souls are\\r\\nsubstances without extension and motive forces. In this respect they are\\r\\nanalogous to God. They are united to bodies and act on them. How? This is\\r\\nan impenetrable mystery, but they are closely and substantially united to\\r\\nthe bodies, which is proved by physical pains depressing the soul and moral\\r\\nsufferings depressing the body; and they act on them, not by creating\\r\\nmovements, for the quantity of movements is always the same, but by\\r\\ndirecting the movements after this fashion or that. Souls being spiritual,\\r\\nthere is no reason for their disaggregation, that is, their demise, and in\\r\\nfact they do not die.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is for this reason that Descartes lays such stress on animals not having\\r\\nsouls. If they had souls, the souls would be spiritual, they would not be\\r\\nsusceptible to disaggregation and would be immortal. \"Save atheism, there\\r\\nis no doctrine more dangerous and detestable than that,\" but animals are\\r\\nsoulless and purely mechanism; Descartes exerts himself to prove this in\\r\\ngreat detail, and he thus escapes avowing the immortality of the souls of\\r\\nanimals, which is repugnant to him, or by allowing that they perish with\\r\\nthe bodies to be exposed to the objection: \"Will it not be the same with\\r\\nthe souls of men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FREEDOM OF THE SOUL.--The human soul is endowed with freedom to\\r\\ndo good or evil. What proof is there of this freedom? First, the inward\\r\\nfeeling that we have. Every evident idea is true. Now, not only have we\\r\\nthe idea of this freedom, but it would be impossible for us not to have it.\\r\\nFreedom \"is known without proofs, merely by the experience we have of it.\"\\r\\nIt is by the feeling of our freedom, of our free-will that we understand\\r\\nthat we exist as a being, as a thing which is not merely a thing. The true\\r\\n_ego_ is the will. Even more than an intelligent being, man is a free\\r\\nindividual, and only feels himself to be a man when feeling himself free,\\r\\nso that he might not believe himself to be intelligent, nor think himself\\r\\nsensible, etc., but not to think himself free would for him be moral\\r\\nsuicide; and in fact he actually never does anything which he does not\\r\\nbelieve himself to be free to do--that is, which he does not believe that\\r\\nhe might avoid doing, if he so wished. Those who say, \"It is simply the\\r\\nfeeling that it is better for ourselves which tends to make us do this\\r\\ninstead of doing that,\" are deeply in error. They forget that we often\\r\\nprefer the worst for ourselves in order to prove to ourselves that we are\\r\\nfree and therefore have no other _motive power than our own freedom_.\\r\\n(And this is exactly what contemporaneous philosophy has thus formulated:\\r\\n\"Will is neither determinate nor indeterminate, it is determinative.\")\\r\\n\"Even when a very obvious reason leads us to a thing, although morally\\r\\nspeaking it is difficult for us to do the opposite, nevertheless, speaking\\r\\nabsolutely, we can, for we are always free to prevent ourselves from\\r\\npursuing a good thing clearly known ... provided only that _we think it\\r\\nis beneficial thereby to give evidence of the truth of our free-will_.\"\\r\\nIt is the pure and simple wish to be free which _creates an action;_\\r\\nit is the all-powerful liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs has been happily observed, in relation to the universe the philosophy of\\r\\nDescartes is a mechanical philosophy; in relation to man the philosophy of\\r\\nDescartes is a philosophy of will. As has also been remarked, there are\\r\\nvery striking analogies between Corneille and Descartes from the point of\\r\\nview of the apotheosis of the will, and the _Meditations_ having\\r\\nappeared after the great works of Corneille, it is not so much that\\r\\nCorneille was a Cartesian, as that Descartes was a follower of Corneille.\\r\\n\\r\\nPSYCHOLOGY OF DESCARTES.--Descartes has almost written a psychology,\\r\\nwhat with his _Treatise on the Passions_ and his letters and, besides,\\r\\ncertain passages in his _Meditations_. The soul thinks and has\\r\\npassions. There are three kinds of ideas, the factitious, the adventitious,\\r\\nand the innate; the factitious ideas are those which the imagination forms;\\r\\nthe adventitious ideas are those suggested by the external world through\\r\\nthe intermediary of the senses; the innate ideas are those constituting the\\r\\nmind itself, the conditions under which it thinks and apart from which it\\r\\ncannot think: we cannot conceive an object not extended, nor an object\\r\\napart from time, nor anything without a cause; the ideas of time, space,\\r\\nand cause are innate ideas; we cannot conceive ourselves as other than\\r\\nfree; the idea of liberty is an innate idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soul has passions; it is therein that, without dependence on the body,\\r\\nit has intimate relations with and is modified by it, not radically, but in\\r\\nits daily life. There are operations of the soul which cannot strictly be\\r\\ntermed passions, and yet which are directed or at least _influenced_\\r\\nby the body. Memory is passive, and consequently memory is a species of\\r\\npassion. The lively sensations which the body transmits to the brain leave\\r\\nimpressions (Malebranche would say \"traces\"), and according to these\\r\\nimpressions the soul is moved a second or a third time, and that is what is\\r\\ncalled memory. \"The impressions of the brain render it suitable to stir\\r\\nthe soul in the same way as it has been stirred before, and also to make it\\r\\nrecollect something, just as the folds in a piece of paper or linen make it\\r\\nmore suitable to be folded anew as it was before than if it had never been\\r\\nthus folded.\" Similarly, the association of ideas is passive, and in\\r\\nconsequence is a kind of passion. The association of ideas is the fact that\\r\\nthought passes along the same path it has already traversed, and follows in\\r\\nits labyrinth the thread which interlinks its thoughts, and this thread is\\r\\nthe traces which thoughts have left in the brain. In abandoning ourselves\\r\\nto the association of ideas, we are passive and we yield ourselves freely\\r\\nto a passion. That is so true that current speech itself recognizes this:\\r\\nmusing is a passion, it is possible to have a passion for musing, and\\r\\nmusing is nothing else than the association of ideas in which the will does\\r\\nnot intervene.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PASSIONS.--Coming to the passions strictly speaking, there are\\r\\nsome which are of the soul and only of the soul; the passion for God is a\\r\\npassion of the soul, the passion for liberty is a passion of the soul; but\\r\\nthere are many more which are the effects of the union of the soul with the\\r\\nbody. These passions are excited in the soul by a state of the body or a\\r\\nmovement of the body or of some part of the body; they are \"emotions\" of\\r\\nthe soul corresponding to \"movements\" of the machine. All passions have\\r\\nrelation to the desire for pleasure and the fear of pain, and according as\\r\\nthey relate to the former or the latter are they expansive or oppressive.\\r\\nThere are six principal passions, of which all the rest are only\\r\\nmodifications: admiration, love, desire, joy, having relation to the\\r\\nappetite of happiness; hatred, sadness, having relation to the fear of\\r\\npain. \"All the passions are good and may become bad\" (Descartes in this\\r\\ndeviates emphatically from Stoicism for which the passions are simply\\r\\nmaladies of the soul). All passions are good in themselves. They are\\r\\ndestined (this is a remarkable theory) to cause the duration of thoughts\\r\\nwhich would otherwise pass and be rapidly effaced; by reason of this, they\\r\\ncause man to act; if he were only directed by his thoughts, unaccompanied\\r\\nby his passions, he would never act, and if it be recognized that man is\\r\\nborn for action, it will at the same time be recognized that it is\\r\\nnecessary he should have passions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, you will say, there can be good passions (of a nature to give force to\\r\\njust ideas) and evil passions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, they are all good, but all also have their bad side, their deviation,\\r\\nrather, which enables them to become bad. Therefore, in each passion no\\r\\nmatter what it be, it is always possible to distinguish between the passion\\r\\nitself, which is always good, and the excess, the deviation, the\\r\\ndegradation or corruption of this passion which constitutes, if it be\\r\\ndesired to call it so, an evil passion, and this is what Descartes\\r\\ndemonstrates, passion by passion, in the fullest detail, in his _Treatise\\r\\non the Passions_.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PART OF THE SOUL.--If it is thus, what will be the part of the\\r\\nsoul (the soul is the will)? It will be to abandon itself to good passions,\\r\\nor more accurately to the good that is in all passions, and to reduce the\\r\\npassions to be \"nothing more than themselves.\" In courage, for example,\\r\\nthere is courage and temerity. The action of the will, enlightened by the\\r\\njudgment, will consist in reducing courage to be nothing but courage. In\\r\\nfear, there is cowardice and there is the feeling of self-preservation\\r\\nwhich, according to Descartes, is the foundation of fear and which is a\\r\\nvery good passion. The action of the soul is to reduce fear to simple\\r\\nprudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut _how_ will the will effect these metamorphoses or at least these\\r\\ndepartures, these separations, these reductions to the due proportion?\\r\\n_Directly_ it can effect _nothing_ upon the passions; it cannot\\r\\n_remove_ them; it cannot even remove the baser portions of them; but\\r\\nit can exercise influence over them by the intermediary of reasoning; it\\r\\ncan lead them to the attentive consideration of the thought that they carry\\r\\nwith them, and by this consideration modify them. For instance, if it is a\\r\\nquestion of fear, the soul forces fear to consider that the peril is much\\r\\nless than was imagined, and thus little by little brings it back to simple\\r\\nprudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this method, although indirect, is very potent; for it ends by\\r\\nreally transforming the passions into their opposites. Persuade fear that\\r\\nthere is less peril in marching forward than in flight and that the most\\r\\nsalutary flight is the flight forward and you have changed fear to\\r\\ncourage.--But such an influence of the will over the passions is\\r\\nextraordinarily unlikely: it will never take place.--Yes, by habit! Habit\\r\\ntoo is a passion, or, if you will, a passive state, like that of memory or\\r\\nthe association of ideas, and there are men possessed only of that passion.\\r\\nBut the will, by the means which have been described, by imposing an act, a\\r\\nfirst act, creates a commencement of habit, by imposing a second confirms\\r\\nthat habit, by imposing a third strengthens it, and so on. In plain words,\\r\\nthe will, by reasoning with the passions and reasoning with them\\r\\nincessantly, brings them back to what is good in them and ends by bringing\\r\\nthem back there permanently, so that it arrives at having only the passions\\r\\nit desires, or, if you prefer it, for it is the same thing, at having only\\r\\nthe passion for good. Morality consists in loving noble passions, as was\\r\\nlater observed by Vauvenargues, and that means to love all the passions,\\r\\neach for what is good in it, that is to reduce each passion to what real\\r\\ngoodness is inherent in it, and that is to gather all the passions into\\r\\none, which is the passion of duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE METHOD OF DESCARTES.--As has been observed, not only had\\r\\nDescartes influence through all that he wrote, but it was by his method\\r\\nthat he has exerted the greatest and most durable sway, and that is why we\\r\\nconclude with the examination of his method. It is all contained in this:\\r\\nto accept nothing as true except what is evident; to accept as true all\\r\\nthat is evident. Descartes therefore made evidence the touchstone of\\r\\ncertainty. But mark well the profound meaning of this method: what is it\\r\\nthat gives me the assurance of the evidence of such or such an idea? How\\r\\nshall I know that such an idea is really evident to me? Because I see it in\\r\\nperfect clearness? No, that does not suffice: the evidence may be\\r\\ndeceptive; there can be false evidence; all the wrong ideas of the\\r\\nphilosophers of antiquity, save when they were sophists, had for them the\\r\\ncharacter of being evident. Why? Why should error be presented to the mind\\r\\nas an evident truth? Because in truth, in profound truthfulness, it must\\r\\nbe admitted that judgment does not depend upon the intelligence. And on\\r\\nwhat does it depend? On will, on free-will. This is how. No doubt, error\\r\\ndepends on our judgment, but our judgment depends on our will in the sense\\r\\nthat it depends on us whether we adhere to our judgment without it being\\r\\nsufficiently precise or do not adhere to it because it is not sufficiently\\r\\nprecise: \"If I abstain from giving my judgment on a subject when I do not\\r\\nconceive it with sufficient clearness and distinction, it is evident that I\\r\\nshall not be deceived.\" Evidence is therefore not only a matter of\\r\\njudgment, of understanding, of intelligence, it is a matter of energetic\\r\\nwill and of freedom courageously acquired. We are confronted with evidence\\r\\nwhen, with a clear brain, we are capable, in order to accept or refuse what\\r\\nit lays before us, of acting \"after such a fashion,\" of having put\\r\\nourselves in such a state of the soul that we feel \"that no external force\\r\\ncan constrain us to think in such or such a way.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese external forces are authority, prejudices, personal interest, or that\\r\\nof party. The faculty of perceiving evidence is therefore the triumph both\\r\\nof sound judgment in itself and of a freedom of mind which, supposing\\r\\nprobity, scrupulousness, and courage, and perhaps the most difficult of all\\r\\ncourage, supposes a profound and vigorous morality. Evidence is given only\\r\\nto men who are first highly intelligent and next, or rather before all\\r\\nelse, are profoundly honest. Evidence is not a consequence of morality; but\\r\\nmorality is the _condition_ of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is the foundation of the method of Descartes; add to it his advice on\\r\\nthe art of reasoning, which even in his time was not at all novel, but\\r\\nwhich with him is very precise; not to generalize too hastily, not to be\\r\\nput off with words, but to have a clear definition of every word, etc., and\\r\\nthus a sufficient idea of it will be obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow first, to this method Descartes was unfaithful, as always happens, and\\r\\noften accepted the suggestions of his magnificent imagination as the\\r\\nevidences of his reason; secondly, the touchstone of evidence is certainly\\r\\nthe best, but is far from being infallible (and Vico has ridiculed it with\\r\\nas much sense as wit) and the freest mind can still find false things\\r\\nevident; yet, thirdly, favouring freedom of research self-controlled,\\r\\nindividual and scornful of all authority, the method of Descartes has\\r\\nbecome a banner, a motto, and a flag for all modern philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDESCARTES THE FATHER OF MODERN PHILOSOPHY.--And from all that the\\r\\nresult has been that all modern philosophy, with few exceptions, has\\r\\nrecognised Descartes as its parent--that individual evidence, if it may be\\r\\nthus expressed, favouring temerity and each believing himself closer to the\\r\\ntruth the more he differed from others, and consequently was unable to\\r\\nsuspect himself of being subject to influences, individual evidence has\\r\\nprovided a fresh opportunity for self-deception; finally, that Descartes,\\r\\nby a not uncommon metamorphosis, by means of his system which he did not\\r\\nfollow, has become the head or the venerated ancestor of doctrines which he\\r\\nwould have detested and which he already did detest more than all\\r\\nothers. Because he said that evidence alone and the free investigation of\\r\\nevidence led to truth, he has become the ancestor of the sceptics who are\\r\\npersuaded that surrender must be made only to evidence and that evidence\\r\\ncannot be found; and he has become the ancestor of the positivists who\\r\\nbelieve that evidence certainly exists somewhere, but not in metaphysics or\\r\\nin theodicy, or in knowledge of the soul, of immortality, and of God,\\r\\nbranches of knowledge which surpass our means of knowing, which are in fact\\r\\noutside knowledge. So that this man who conceived more than any man, this\\r\\nman who so often constructed without a sure foundation, and this man, yet\\r\\nagain, as has been aptly said, who always thought by innate ideas, by his\\r\\nformula has become the master and above all the guarantor of those who are\\r\\nthe most reserved and most distrustful as to philosophic construction,\\r\\ninnate ideas, and imagination. This does not in the least diminish his\\r\\nbrilliant merit; it is only one of those changes of direction in which the\\r\\nhistory of ideas abounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nCARTESIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the Seventeenth Century was under the Influence of Descartes.\\r\\nPort-Royal, Bossuet, F\\xc3\\xa9nelon, Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibnitz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCARTESIAN INFLUENCE.--Nearly all the seventeenth century was\\r\\nCartesian, and in the general sense of the word, not only as supporters of\\r\\nthe method of evidence, but as adherents of the general philosophy of\\r\\nDescartes. Gassendi (a Proven\\xc3\\xa7al, and not an Italian), professor of\\r\\nphilosophy at Aix, subsequently in Paris, was not precisely a faithful\\r\\ndisciple of Descartes, and he opposed him several times; he had leanings\\r\\ntowards Epicurus and the doctrine of atoms; he drew towards Hobbes, but he\\r\\nwas also a fervent admirer of Bacon, and so approached Descartes, who\\r\\nthought very highly of him, though impatiently galled by his criticisms.\\r\\nAfter the example of Epicurus he was the most sober and austere of men, and\\r\\nof the two it was Descartes rather than he who was Epicurean in the common\\r\\nuse of the word. According to a tradition, which to my mind rests on\\r\\ninsufficient proof, he was an instructor of Moli\\xc3\\xa8re.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the thinkers of the seventeenth century came more or less profoundly\\r\\nunder the Cartesian influence: Pascal, Bossuet, F\\xc3\\xa9nelon, Arnauld, and all\\r\\nPort-Royal. This influence was to diminish only in the eighteenth century,\\r\\nthough kept up by the impenitent Fontenelle, but outweighed by that of\\r\\nLocke, to reappear very vigorously in the nineteenth century in France in\\r\\nthe school of Maine de Biran and of Cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALEBRANCHE.--A separate niche must be made for the Cartesians,\\r\\nalmost as great as Descartes, who filled the seventeenth century with their\\r\\nrenown,--the Frenchman Malebranche, the Dutchman Spinoza, and the German\\r\\nLeibnitz. Pushing the theories of Descartes further than Descartes would\\r\\nhimself in all probability have desired to, from what Descartes had said\\r\\nthat it was only _through God_ that we perceived accurately,\\r\\nMalebranche declared that it was only _in God_ that we perceived\\r\\naccurately, and fundamentally this is the same idea; it can only be deemed\\r\\nthat Malebranche is the more precise: \"God alone is known by Himself [is\\r\\nbelieved in without uncertainty]; there is only He that we can see in\\r\\nimmediate and direct perspective.\" All the rest we see in Him, in His\\r\\nlight, in the light He creates in our minds. When we see, it is that we are\\r\\nin Him. Evidence is divine light. He is the link of ideas. (And thus\\r\\nMalebranche brought Plato near to Descartes and showed that, without the\\r\\nlatter being aware of it, they both said the same thing.) God is always the\\r\\ncause and as He is the cause of all real things, He is cause also of all\\r\\ntruths, and as He is everywhere in real objects, He is also everywhere in\\r\\nthe true ideas which we can have, or rather in which we can participate.\\r\\nWhen we seek a truth we pray without thinking we do so; attention is a\\r\\nprayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same way, from the saying of Descartes that the universe is a\\r\\ncontinuous creation, Malebranche deduced or rather concluded that our\\r\\nthoughts and actions are acts of God. There can be no action of the body on\\r\\nthe soul to produce ideas; that would be inconceivable; but on the\\r\\noccasion, for instance, of our eyes resting on an object, God gives us an\\r\\nidea of that object, whether in conformity or not we cannot tell; but at\\r\\nany rate He gives us that idea of the object which He wishes us to have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no action of our soul on our body; that would be\\r\\ninconceivable. But God to our will adds a force having a tendency towards\\r\\ngoodness as a rule, and to each of our volitions adds a force tending to\\r\\nits execution and capable of executing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, when our will is evil and we execute it, does God sin in our name?\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly not; because sin is not an act; it consists in doing nothing; it\\r\\nconsists precisely in the soul not acting on the body; therefore it is not\\r\\na force but a weakness. Sin is that God has withdrawn Himself from us. The\\r\\nsinner is only a being who is without strength because he is lacking in\\r\\ngrace.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle of morality is the respect for order and the love of\\r\\norder. That makes two degrees, the first of which is regularity and the\\r\\nsecond virtue. To conform to order is highly rational but without merit\\r\\n(_e.g._, to give money to the poor from habit or possibly from\\r\\nvanity). To love order and to desire that it should be greater, more\\r\\ncomplete, and nearer to the will of God, is to adhere to God, to live in\\r\\nGod, just as to see rightly is to see in God. All morality, into the\\r\\ndetails of which we will not enter, evolves from the love of order. The\\r\\nuniverse is a vast mechanism, as was stated by Descartes, set in motion and\\r\\ndirected by God--that is to say, by the laws established by God; for God\\r\\nacts only by general dispositions (which are laws) and not by particular\\r\\ndispositions. In other words, there exists a will, but there are no\\r\\nvolitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nMIRACLES.--But then you will say there are no miracles; for miracle\\r\\nis precisely a particular will traversing and interrupting the general\\r\\nwill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo begin with, there are very few miracles, which therefore permits order\\r\\nto subsist; it would be only if there were incessant miracles that order\\r\\nwould be non-existent. Next, a miracle is a warning God gives to men\\r\\nbecause of their weakness, to remind them that behind the laws there is a\\r\\nLawgiver, behind the general dispositions a Being who disposes. Because of\\r\\ntheir intellectual weakness, if they never saw any derogation from the\\r\\ngeneral laws they would take them to be fatalities. A miracle is a grace\\r\\nintervening in things, just as grace properly so-called intervenes in human\\r\\nactions. And it is not contradictory to the general design of God, since\\r\\nby bringing human minds back to the truth that there is a Being who wills,\\r\\nit accustoms them to consider all general laws as permanent acts, but also\\r\\nas the acts of the Being who wills. The miracle has the virtue of making\\r\\neverything in the world miraculous, which is true. Hence the miracle\\r\\nconfirms the idea of order. Therein, perhaps alone, the exception proves\\r\\nthe rule.\\r\\n\\r\\nSPINOZA.--Spinoza, who during his life was a pure Stoic and the\\r\\npurest of Stoics, polishing the lenses of astronomical telescopes in order\\r\\nto gain his living, refusing all pensions and all the professorial\\r\\npositions offered to him, and living well-nigh on nothing, had read\\r\\nDescartes and, to conform to the principle of evidence, had begun by\\r\\nrenouncing his religion, which was that of the Jews. His general outlook\\r\\non the world was this: There is only one God. God is all. Only He has His\\r\\nattributes--that is to say, His manners of being and His modes, that is His\\r\\nmodifications, as the sun (merely a comparison) has as its manners of\\r\\nbeing, its roundness, colour, and heat, as modifications its rays,\\r\\nterrestrial heat, direct and diffused light, etc. Now God has two\\r\\nattributes, thought and extension, as had already been observed by\\r\\nDescartes; and for modifications He has exactly all we can see, touch, or\\r\\nfeel, etc. The human soul is an attribute of God, as is everything else; it\\r\\nis an attribute of God in His power. It is not free, for all that comes\\r\\nfrom God, all that _is of God_, is a regular and necessary development\\r\\nof God Himself. \"There is nothing contingent\" [nothing which may either\\r\\nhappen or not happen]. All things are determined, by the necessity of the\\r\\ndivine nature, to exist and to act in a given manner. There is therefore\\r\\nno free-will in the soul, the soul is determined to will this or that by a\\r\\ncause which is itself determined by another and that by another, and so on\\r\\nto infinity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless we believe ourselves to be free and according to the principle\\r\\nof evidence we are; for nothing is more evident to us than our liberty. We\\r\\nare as intimately convinced of our liberty as of our existence and we\\r\\n_all_ affirm, I am free,--with the same emphasis that Descartes\\r\\naffirms: I am. I am and I am free are the two things it is impossible for\\r\\nman to doubt, no matter what effort he makes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt, but it is an illusion. It is the illusion of a being who feels\\r\\nhimself as cause, but does not feel himself as effect. Try to imagine a\\r\\nbilliard ball which feels it moves others, but which does not feel that it\\r\\nis moved. What we call decision is an idea which decides us because it\\r\\nexercises more power over us than the others do; what we term deliberation\\r\\nis a hesitancy between two or three ideas which at the moment have equal\\r\\nforce; what we name volition is an idea, and what we call will is our\\r\\nunderstanding applied to facts. We do not want to fight; we conceive the\\r\\nidea of fighting and the idea carries us away; we do not want to hang\\r\\nourselves; we have the obsessing idea of hanging ourselves and this thought\\r\\nruns away with us.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS MORAL SYSTEM.--Spinoza wrote a system of morality. Is it not\\r\\nradically impossible to write a system of morality when the author does not\\r\\nbelieve in free-will? The admirable originality of Spinoza, even though\\r\\nhis idea can be contested, is precisely that morality depends on belief in\\r\\nthe necessity of all things--that is, the more one is convinced of this\\r\\nnecessity so much the more does one attain high morality--that is, the more\\r\\none believes oneself free the more one is _immoral_. The man who\\r\\nbelieves himself free claims to run counter to the universal order, and\\r\\nmorality precisely is adherence to it; the man who believes himself free\\r\\nseeks for an individual good just as if there could be an individual good,\\r\\njust as if the best for each one were not to submit to the necessary laws\\r\\nof everything, laws which constitute what is good; the man who thinks\\r\\nhimself free sets himself against God, believes himself God since he\\r\\nbelieves himself to be creator of what he does, and since he believes\\r\\nhimself capable of deranging something in the mechanism and of introducing\\r\\na certain amount of movement. As a matter of fact, he does nothing of the\\r\\nkind; but he believes that he does it, and this mere thought, false and low\\r\\nas it is, keeps him in the most miserable condition of life; to sum up, a\\r\\nman who believes himself free may not perhaps be an atheist, but he is\\r\\nungodly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the contrary, the man who does not believe himself free believes he is\\r\\nin the hands of God, and that is the beginning of wisdom and the beginning\\r\\nof virtue. We are in the hands of God as the clay is in those of the\\r\\npotter; the mad vase would be the one which reproached the potter for\\r\\nhaving made it small instead of big, common instead of decorative. It is\\r\\nthe beginning of wisdom to believe oneself in the hands of God; to see Him,\\r\\nto see Him the least indistinctly that we can, therein lies the highest\\r\\nwisdom; we must see His designs, or at least His great design and associate\\r\\nourselves with it, thus becoming not only part of Him, which we always are,\\r\\nbut a conscient part of Him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the love of God, and the love of God is virtue itself. We ought to\\r\\nlove God without consideration of the good He can do us and of the\\r\\npenalties He can inflict upon us; for to love God from love of a beneficent\\r\\nGod or from fear of a punitive God is not to love God but to love oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PASSIONS.--We have our passions as enemies and as obstacles to\\r\\nour elevation to this semi-perfection. It is they which cause us to do\\r\\nimmoral acts. \"Immoral,\" has that a meaning from the moment that we do\\r\\nnothing which we are not obliged to do? Yes, just as when led by our\\r\\ndeceitful mind we have arrived necessarily at a false idea, the fact of\\r\\nthis thought being necessary does not prevent it from being false; we may\\r\\nhave been led by necessity to commit a villainous action, but that does not\\r\\nprevent its being immoral. The passions are our imperfections, omissions,\\r\\ngaps in a soul which is not full of the idea of God and of universal order\\r\\nand the love of God and of universal order, and which, in consequence,\\r\\nlives individually--that is, separated from the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe passions are infinite in number and Spinoza, in a bulky volume,\\r\\nfurnished a minute and singularly profound description of the principal\\r\\nones alone, into the details of which we regret that we cannot enter. The\\r\\n_Ethics_ of Spinoza is an incomparable masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of the passions is very salutary, because in studying them one\\r\\ngets so detached from them that one can perceive their emptiness, their\\r\\nmeanness, and their puerile, nay, even bestial character. It might even be\\r\\nadded that the mere thought of studying them is already an act of\\r\\ndetachment in reference to them. \"Thou wouldst not seek Me, hadst thou not\\r\\nalready found Me,\" said God to Pascal. \"Thou wouldst not make\\r\\ninvestigations about us, hadst thou not already quitted us,\" the passions\\r\\nmight say to the philosopher.\\r\\n\\r\\nSANCTIONS OF MORALITY.--What are the sanctions of morality? They are\\r\\nnecessary sanctions; just as everything is necessary and may even be said\\r\\nto be mechanical. There is neither merit nor demerit and the criminal is\\r\\nnot culpable; only he is outside order, and everything must be in order.\\r\\n\"He who is maddened by the bite of a mad dog is certainly innocent; yet\\r\\nanyone has the right to suffocate him. In the same way, the man who cannot\\r\\ngovern his passions by fear of the law is a very excusable invalid; yet he\\r\\ncannot enjoy peace of mind, or the knowledge of God, or even the love of\\r\\nGod, and it is necessary that he perish.\" Through death he has re-entered\\r\\nwithin order.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut does the sanction of beyond-the-grave exist, and is the soul immortal,\\r\\nand are we to be rewarded therein in another life? The conclusion of\\r\\nSpinoza on this matter is hesitating, but at the risk of misrepresenting\\r\\nit, which I fear to do, it seems to me that it can be thus summed\\r\\nup--_The soul makes itself immortal_, in proportion as by the\\r\\nknowledge and love of God it participates more in God. In proportion it\\r\\nmakes itself divine; and approaching perfection, by the same progress it\\r\\nalso approaches immortality. It is conceivable that by error and sin it\\r\\nkills itself, and by virtue renders itself imperishable. This immortality\\r\\nis not or does not seem to be personal, it is literally a definite re-entry\\r\\ninto the bosom of God; Spinozian immortality would therefore be a\\r\\nprolongation of the same effort which we make in this life to adhere to\\r\\nuniversal order; the recompense for having adhered to it here below is to\\r\\nbe absorbed in it there, and in that lies true beatitude. Here below we\\r\\nought to see everything from the point of view of eternity (_sub specie\\r\\naeternitatis_), and this is a way of being eternal; elsewhere we shall\\r\\nbe in eternity itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLEIBNITZ.--Leibnitz possessed a universal mind, being historian,\\r\\nnaturalist, politician, diplomatist, scholar, theologian, mathematician;\\r\\nhere we will regard him only as philosopher. For Leibnitz the basis, the\\r\\nsubstance of all beings is not either thought or extension as with\\r\\nDescartes, but is force, productive of action. \"What does not act does not\\r\\nexist.\" Everything that exists is a force, either action or tendency to\\r\\naction. And force, all force has two characteristics: it desires to do, it\\r\\nwishes to think. The world is the graduated compound of all these\\r\\nforces. Above all there is the supreme force, God, who is infinite force,\\r\\ninfinite thought; by successive descents those base and obscure forces are\\r\\nreached which seem to have neither power nor thought, and yet have a\\r\\nminimum of power and even of thought, so to speak, latent. God thinks and\\r\\nacts infinitely; man thinks and acts powerfully, thanks to reason, which\\r\\ndistinguishes him from the rest of creation; the animal acts and thinks\\r\\ndimly, but it does act and think, for it has a soul composed of memory and\\r\\nof the results and consequences of memory, and by parenthesis\\r\\n\"three-fourths of our own actions are governed by memory, and most\\r\\nfrequently we act like animals\"; plants act, and if they do not think, at\\r\\nleast feel (which is still thought), though more dimly than animals; and\\r\\nfinally in the mineral kingdom the power of action and thought slumber, but\\r\\nare not non-existent since they can be transformed into plants, animals,\\r\\nand men, into living matter which feels and thinks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, as was later on to be maintained by Schopenhauer, everything is\\r\\nfull of souls, and of souls which are forces as well as intelligences. The\\r\\nhuman soul is a force too, like the body. Between these two forces, which\\r\\nseem to act on one another and which certainly act in concert in such\\r\\nfashion that the movement desired by the soul is executed by the body or\\r\\nthat the soul obviously assents to a movement desired by the body, what can\\r\\nbe the affinity and the relation, in what consists their concurrence and\\r\\nconcord? Leibnitz (and there was already something of the same nature\\r\\nsuggested by Descartes) believes that all the forces of the world act, each\\r\\nspontaneously; but that among all the actions they perform there exists an\\r\\nagreement imposed by God, a concord establishing universal order, a\\r\\n\"preestablished harmony\" causing them all to co-operate in the same\\r\\ndesign. Well, then, between the soul, this force, and the body, this force\\r\\nalso, this harmony reigns as between any force whatever in nature and one\\r\\nand all of the others; and that is the explanation of the union and concord\\r\\nbetween the soul and the body. Imagine two well-constructed clocks wound up\\r\\nby the same maker; they indicate the same hour, and it might appear that\\r\\nthis one directs the other, or that the other directs the first. All the\\r\\nforces of the world are clocks which agree with each other, because they\\r\\nhave been regulated in advance by the divine clockmaker, and they all\\r\\nindicate the eternal hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RADICAL OPTIMISM OF LEIBNITZ.--From all these general views on\\r\\nmatter, on mind and on the mind, Leibnitz arrived at a radical optimism\\r\\nwhich is the thing for which he has since been most ridiculed, and by\\r\\nwhich, at any rate, he has remained famous. He believes that all is good,\\r\\ndespite the evil of which no one can dispute the existence; and he believes\\r\\nthat all is the best _possible_ in the best of _possible_\\r\\nworlds. In fact, God is supreme wisdom and supreme goodness; that was quite\\r\\nevident to Descartes, who in the matter of evidence was not easily\\r\\nsatisfied. This perfect wisdom and perfect goodness could choose only what\\r\\nis best.--But yet evil exists! Diminish it as much as you choose, it still\\r\\nexists.--It exists by a necessity inherent in what is created. Everything\\r\\ncreated is imperfect. God alone is perfect; what is imperfect is by its\\r\\ndefinition evil mingled with good. Evil is only the boundary of good, where\\r\\nGod was compelled to stop in creating beings and things other than Himself,\\r\\nand if He had created only according to absolute goodness, He could have\\r\\ncreated only Himself. And that is the precise meaning of this phrase \"the\\r\\nbest of possible worlds\"; the world is perfect so far as that which is\\r\\ncreated, and therefore imperfect, can be perfect; so far as what is not God\\r\\ncan be divine; the world is God Himself as far as He can remain Himself\\r\\nwhilst being anything else than Himself. THE THREE EVILS.--Let us\\r\\ndistinguish in order to comprehend better. There are three evils: the\\r\\nmetaphysical, the physical, and the moral. Metaphysical evil is this very\\r\\nfact of not being perfection; it is natural enough that what emanates only\\r\\nfrom perfection should not be perfection. Physical evil is suffering; God\\r\\ncannot _will_ suffering, desire it, or cherish it; but He can permit\\r\\nit as a means of good, as a condition of good; for there would be no moral\\r\\ngood if there were not occasion for struggle, and there would be no\\r\\noccasion for struggling if physical evil did not exist; imagine a paradise;\\r\\nall the inhabitants merely exist and never have cause to show the slightest\\r\\nendurance, the least courage, the smallest virtue. And finally, as to\\r\\nmoral evil, which is sin, God can even less desire that it should exist,\\r\\nbut He can admit its existence, _allow it to be_, to afford men\\r\\noccasion for merit or demerit. Nothing is more easy than to criticize God\\r\\nwhilst considering only a portion of His work and not considering it as a\\r\\nwhole. He must have created it to be a whole and it is as a whole that it\\r\\nmust be judged. And precisely because the whole cannot be comprehended by\\r\\nanyone, \"hold thy peace, foolish reason,\" as Pascal said, and judge not or\\r\\njudge _a priori_, since here it is not possible to judge by\\r\\nexperience; and declare that the Perfect can have willed only the most\\r\\nperfect that is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE POSSIBLE AND THE IMPOSSIBLE.--There still remains the\\r\\nfundamental objection: to reduce God to the conditions of the possible is\\r\\nto limit Him, and it is useless to say that God is justified if He has done\\r\\nall the good possible. He is not; the words \"possible\" and \"impossible\"\\r\\nhaving no meaning to Him who is omnipotent, and by definition infinite\\r\\npower could effect the impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Leibnitz replies, there is a metaphysical impossibility, there is an\\r\\nimpossibility in the infinite; this impossibility is absurdity, is\\r\\ncontradiction. Could God make the whole smaller than the part or any line\\r\\nshorter than a straight one? Reason replies in the negative. Is God\\r\\ntherefore limited? He is limited by the absurd and that means He is\\r\\nunlimited; for the absurd is a falling away. It is therefore credible that\\r\\nthe mixture of evil and good is a metaphysical necessity to which I will\\r\\nnot say God submits, but in which He acts naturally, and that the absence\\r\\nof evil is a metaphysical contradiction, an absurdity in itself, which God\\r\\ncannot commit precisely because He is perfect; and no doubt, instead of\\r\\ndrawing this conclusion, we should actually see it, were the totality of\\r\\nthings, of their relations, of their concordance, and of their harmony\\r\\nknown to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe optimism of Leibnitz was ridiculed specially in the _Candide_ of\\r\\nVoltaire, ingeniously defended by Rousseau, magnificently defended by\\r\\nVictor Hugo in the following verses, well worthy of Leibnitz:\\r\\n\\r\\n \"Oui peut-\\xc3\\xaatre au del\\xc3\\xa0 de la sph\\xc3\\xa8re des nues,\\r\\n  Au sein de cet azur immobile et dormant,\\r\\n  Peut-\\xc3\\xaatre faites-vous des choses inconnues\\r\\n  O\\xc3\\xb9 la douleur de l\\'homme entre comme \\xc3\\xa9l\\xc3\\xa9ment.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ENGLISH PHILOSOPHERS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke: His Ideas on Human Liberty, Morality, General\\r\\nPolitics, and Religious Politics.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCKE.--Locke, very learned in various sciences--physics, chemistry,\\r\\nmedicine, often associated with politics, receiving enlightenment from\\r\\nlife, from frequent travels, from friendships with interesting and\\r\\nillustrious men, always studying and reflecting until an advanced old age,\\r\\nwrote only carefully premeditated works: his _Treatise of Government_\\r\\nand _Essay on the Human Understanding_.\\r\\n\\r\\nLocke appears to have written on the understanding only in order to refute\\r\\nthe \"innate ideas\" of Descartes. For Locke innate ideas have no\\r\\nexistence. The mind before it comes into contact with the external world is\\r\\na blank sheet, and there is nothing in the mind which has not first come\\r\\nthrough the senses. What, then, are ideas? They are sensations registered\\r\\nby the brain, and they are also sensations elaborated and modified by\\r\\nreflection. These ideas then commingle in such a manner as to form an\\r\\nenormous mass of combinations. They are commingled either in a natural or\\r\\nan artificial manner. In a natural manner, that is in a way conforming to\\r\\nthe great primary ideas given us by reflection, the idea of cause, the idea\\r\\nof end, the idea of means to an end, the idea of order, etc., and it is the\\r\\nharmony of these ideas which is commonly termed reason; they become\\r\\nassociated by accident, by the effects of emotion, by the effect of custom,\\r\\netc., and then they give birth to prejudices, errors, and\\r\\nsuperstitions. The passions of the soul are aspects of pleasure and pain.\\r\\nThe idea of a possible pleasure gives birth in us to a desire which is\\r\\ncalled ambition, love, covetousness, gluttony; the idea of a possible pain\\r\\ngives birth in us to fear and horror, and this fear and horror is called\\r\\nhatred, jealousy, rage, aversion, disgust, scorn. At bottom we have only\\r\\ntwo passions, the desire of enjoyment, and the fear of suffering.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FREEDOM OF MAN.--Is man free? Appealing to experience and\\r\\nmaking use only of it and not of intimate feeling, Locke declares in the\\r\\nnegative. A will always seems to him determined by another will, and this\\r\\nother by another to infinity, or by a motive, a weight, a motive power\\r\\nwhich causes a leaning to right or left. Will certainly exists--that is to\\r\\nsay, an exact and lively desire to perform an action, or to continue an\\r\\naction, or to interrupt an action, but this will is not free, for to\\r\\nrepresent it as free is to represent it as capable of wishing what it does\\r\\nnot wish. The will is an anxiety to act in such or such a fashion, and this\\r\\nanxiety, on account of its character of anxiety, of strong emotion, of\\r\\ntension of the soul, appears to us free, appears to us an internal force\\r\\nwhich is self-governed and independent; we feel consciousness of will in\\r\\nthe effort. This tension must not be denied, but it must be recognised as\\r\\nthe effect of a potent desire which the obstacle excites; this tension,\\r\\ntherefore, is an indication of nothing except the potency of the desire and\\r\\nthe existence of an obstacle. Now this desire, so potent that it is\\r\\nirritated by the obstacle, and, so to speak, unites us against it, is a\\r\\npassion dominating and filling our being; so that we are never more swayed\\r\\nby passion than when we believe ourselves to be exercising our will, and in\\r\\nconsequence the more we desire the less are we free.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not essential formally and absolutely to confound will with\\r\\ndesire. Overpowered by heat, we desire to drink cold water, and because we\\r\\nknow that that would do us harm we have the will not to drink; but although\\r\\nthis is an important distinction it is not a fundamental one; what incites\\r\\nus to drink is a passion, what prevents us is another passion, one more\\r\\ngeneral and stronger, the desire not to die, and because this passion by\\r\\nmeeting with and fighting another produces in all our being a powerful\\r\\ntension, it is none the less a passion, even if we ought not to say that it\\r\\nis a still more impassioned passion.\\r\\n\\r\\nLOCKE\\'S THEORY OF POLITICS.--In politics Locke was the adversary of\\r\\nHobbes, whose theories of absolutism have already been noticed. He did not\\r\\nbelieve that the natural state was the war of all against all. He believed\\r\\nmen formed societies not to escape cannibalism, but more easily to\\r\\nguarantee and protect their natural rights: ownership, personal liberty,\\r\\nlegitimate defence. Society exists only to protect these rights, and the\\r\\nreason of its existence lies in this duty to defend them. The sovereign\\r\\ntherefore is not the saviour of the nation, he is its law-maker and\\r\\nmagistrate. If he violates the rights of man, he acts so directly contrary\\r\\nto his mission and his mandate that insurrection against him is\\r\\nlegitimate. The \"wise Locke,\" as Voltaire always called him, was the\\r\\ninventor of the Rights of Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn religious politics he was equally liberal and advocated the separation\\r\\nof Church and State; the State, according to him, should not have any\\r\\nreligion of its own, its province being only to protect equally the liberty\\r\\nof all denominations. Locke was discussed minutely by Leibnitz, who,\\r\\nwithout accepting the innate ideas of Descartes, did not accept the ideas\\r\\nthrough sensation of Locke, and said: \"There is nothing in the intelligence\\r\\nwhich has not first been in the senses,\" granted ... \"except the\\r\\nintelligence itself.\" The intelligence has not innate ideas born ready\\r\\nmade; but it possesses forms of its own in which the ideas arrange\\r\\nthemselves and take shape, and this is the due province of the\\r\\nintelligence. And it was these forms which later on Kant was to call the\\r\\ncategories of the intellect, and at bottom Descartes meant nothing else by\\r\\nhis innate ideas. Locke exerted a prodigious and even imperious influence\\r\\nover the French philosophers of the eighteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ENGLISH PHILOSOPHERS OF THE\\r\\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBerkeley: Highly Idealist Philosophy which Regarded Matter as Non-existent.\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid Hume: Sceptical Philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scottish School: Common Sense Philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBERKELEY.--To the \"sensualist\" Locke succeeded Berkeley, the\\r\\nunrestrained \"idealist,\" like him an Englishman. He began to write when\\r\\nvery young, continued to write until he was sixty, and died at\\r\\nsixty-eight. He believed neither in matter nor in the external world. There\\r\\nwas the whole of his philosophy. Why did he not believe in them? Because\\r\\nall thinkers are agreed that we cannot know whether we see the external\\r\\nworld _as it is_. Then, if we do not know it, why do we affirm that it\\r\\nexists? We know nothing about it. Now we ought to build up the world only\\r\\nwith what we know of it, and to do otherwise is not philosophy but yielding\\r\\nto imagination. What is it that we know of the world? Our ideas, and\\r\\nnothing but our ideas. Very well then, let us say: there are only\\r\\nideas. But whence do these ideas come to us? To explain them as coming from\\r\\nthe external world which we have never seen is to explain obscurity by\\r\\ndenser darkness. They are spiritual, they come to us without doubt from a\\r\\nspirit, from God. This is possible, it is not illogical, and Berkeley\\r\\nbelieves it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doctrine regarded by the eyes of common sense may appear a mere\\r\\nphantasy; but Berkeley saw in it many things of high importance and great\\r\\nuse. If you believe in matter, you can believe in matter only, and that is\\r\\nmaterialism with its moral consequences, which are immoral; if you believe\\r\\nin matter and in God, you are so hampered by this dualism that you do not\\r\\nknow how to separate nature from God, and it therefore comes to pass that\\r\\nyou see God in matter, which is called pantheism. In a word, between us and\\r\\nGod Berkeley has suppressed matter in order that we should come, as it\\r\\nwere, into direct contact with God. He derives much from Malebranche, and\\r\\nit may be said he only pushes his theories to their extreme. Although a\\r\\nbishop, he was not checked, like Descartes, by the idea of God not being\\r\\nable to deceive us, and he answered that God does not deceive us, that He\\r\\ngives us ideas and that it is we who deceive ourselves by attributing them\\r\\nto any other origin than to Him; nor was he checked, like Malebranche, by\\r\\nthe authority of Scripture, which in Genesis portrays God creating\\r\\nmatter. He saw there, no doubt, only a symbolical sense, a simple way of\\r\\nspeaking according to the comprehension of the multitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nDAVID HUME.--David Hume, a Scotsman, better known, at least in his\\r\\nown times, as the historian of England than as a philosopher, nevertheless\\r\\nwell merits consideration in the latter category. David Hume believes in\\r\\nnothing, and, in consequence, it may be said that he is not a philosopher;\\r\\nhe has no philosophic system. He has no philosophic system, it is true; but\\r\\nhe is a critic of philosophy, and therefore he philosophizes. Matter has no\\r\\nexistence; as we know nothing about it, we should not say it exists. But we\\r\\nourselves, we exist. All that we can know about that is that in us there is\\r\\na succession of ideas, of representations; but _we_, but _I_,\\r\\nwhat is that? Of that we know nothing. We are present at a series of\\r\\npictures, and we may call their totality the _ego_; but we do not\\r\\ngrasp ourselves as a thing of unity, as an individual. We are the\\r\\nspectators of an inward dramatic piece behind which we can see no\\r\\nauthor. There is no more reason to believe in _oneself_ than in the\\r\\nexternal world.\\r\\n\\r\\nINNATE IDEAS.--As for innate ideas, they are simply general ideas,\\r\\nwhich are general delusions. We believe, for instance, that every effect\\r\\nhas a cause, or, to express it more correctly, that everything has a cause.\\r\\nWhat do we know about it? What do we see? That one thing follows another,\\r\\nsucceeds to another. What tells us that the latter proceeds from the\\r\\nformer, that the thing B must necessarily come, owing to the thing A\\r\\nexisting? We believe it because every time the thing A has been, the thing\\r\\nB has come. Well, let us say that every time A has been (thus far) B has\\r\\ncome; and say no more. There are regular successions, but we are completely\\r\\nignorant whether there are causes for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LIBERTY AND MORALITY OF HUME.--It results from this that for\\r\\nHume there is no liberty. Very obviously; for when we believe ourselves\\r\\nfree, it is because we believe we can fix upon ourselves as a cause. Now\\r\\nthe word \"cause\" means nothing. We are a succession of phenomena very\\r\\nabsolutely determined. The proof is that we foresee and nearly always\\r\\naccurately (and we could always foresee accurately if we completely knew\\r\\nthe character of the persons and the influences acting on them) what people\\r\\nwe know will do, which would be impossible if they did as they wished. And\\r\\nI, at the very moment when I am absolutely sure I am doing such and such a\\r\\nthing because I desired to, I see my friend smile as he says: \"I was sure\\r\\nyou would do that. See, I wrote it down on this piece of paper.\" He\\r\\nunderstood me as a necessity, when I felt myself to be free. And he,\\r\\nreciprocally, will believe himself free in doing a thing I would have\\r\\nwagered to a certainty that he would not fail to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat system of morality can Hume have with these principles? First of all,\\r\\nhe protests against those who should deduce from his principles the\\r\\nimmorality of his system. Take care, said he wittily (just like Spinoza,\\r\\nby the way), it is the partisans of free-will who are immoral. No doubt! It\\r\\nis when there is liberty that there is no responsibility. I am not\\r\\nresponsible for my actions if they have no connection in me with anything\\r\\ndurable or constant. I have committed murder. Truly it is by chance, if it\\r\\nwas by an entirely isolated determination, entirely detached from the rest\\r\\nof my character, and momentary; and I am only infinitesimally\\r\\nresponsible. But if all my actions are linked together, are conditional\\r\\nupon one another, dependent on one another, if I have committed murder it\\r\\nis because I am an assassin at every moment of my life or nearly so, and\\r\\nthen, oh! how responsible I am!\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that this is the line taken up by judges, since they make careful\\r\\ninvestigation of the antecedents of the accused. They find him all the more\\r\\nculpable if he has always shown bad instincts.--Therefore they find him the\\r\\nmore responsible, the more he has been compelled by necessity.--Yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHume then does not believe himself \"foreclosed\" in morality; he does not\\r\\nbelieve he is forbidden by his principles to have a system of morality and\\r\\nhe has one. It is a morality of sentiment. We have in us the instinct of\\r\\nhappiness and we seek happiness; but we have also in us an instinct of\\r\\ngoodwill which tends to make us seek the general happiness, and reason\\r\\ntells us that there is conciliation or rather concordance between these two\\r\\ninstincts, because it is only in the general happiness that we find our\\r\\nparticular happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SCOTTISH SCHOOL: REID; STEWART.--The Scottish School (end of the\\r\\neighteenth century) was pre-eminently a school of men who attached\\r\\nthemselves to common sense and were excellent moralists. We must at any\\r\\nrate mention Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart. They were bent especially on\\r\\nopposing the transcendent idealism of Berkeley and the scepticism of David\\r\\nHume, also in some measure Locke\\'s doctrine of the blank sheet. They\\r\\nreconstituted the human mind and even the world (which had been so to speak\\r\\ndriven off in vapour by their predecessors), much as they were in the time\\r\\nof Descartes. Let us believe, they said, in the reality of the external\\r\\nworld; let us believe that there are causes and effects; let us believe\\r\\nthere is an _ego,_ a human person whom we directly apprehend, and who\\r\\nis a cause; let us believe that we are free and that we are responsible\\r\\nbecause we are free, etc. They were, pre-eminently, excellent describers of\\r\\nstates of the soul, admirable psychological moralists and they were the\\r\\nancestors of the highly remarkable pleiad of English psychologists of the\\r\\nnineteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V\\r\\n\\r\\nFRENCH PHILOSOPHERS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVoltaire a Disciple of Locke.\\r\\n\\r\\nRousseau a Freethinking Christian, but deeply Imbued\\r\\nwith Religious Sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiderot a Capricious Materialist.\\r\\n\\r\\nD\\'Holbach and Helvetius Avowed Materialists.\\r\\n\\r\\nCondillac a Philosopher of Sensations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVOLTAIRE; ROUSSEAU.--The French philosophy of the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury, fairly feeble it must be avowed, seemed as if dominated by the\\r\\nEnglish philosophy, excepting Berkeley, but especially by Locke and David\\r\\nHume, more particularly Locke, who was the intellectual deity of those\\r\\nFrenchmen of that epoch who were interested in philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever Voltaire dealt with philosophy, he was only the echo of Locke\\r\\nwhose depths he failed to fathom, and to whom he has done some injury, for\\r\\nreading Locke only through Voltaire has led to the belief that Locke was\\r\\nsuperficial.\\r\\n\\r\\nRousseau was both the disciple and adversary of Hobbes, as often occurs,\\r\\nand dealt out to the public the doctrines of Hobbes in an inverted form,\\r\\nmaking the state of nature angelic instead of infernal, and putting the\\r\\ngovernment of all by all in the place of government by one, invariably\\r\\nreaching the same point with a simple difference of form; for if Hobbes\\r\\nargued for despotism exercised by one over all, Rousseau argued for the\\r\\ndespotism of all over each. In _\\xc3\\x89mile_, he was incontestably inspired\\r\\nby the ideas of Locke on education in some degree, but in my opinion less\\r\\nthan has been asserted. On nearly all sides it has been asserted that\\r\\nRousseau exercised great influence over Kant. I know that Kant felt\\r\\ninfinite admiration for Rousseau, but of the influence of Rousseau upon\\r\\nKant I have never been able to discover a trace.\\r\\n\\r\\nDIDEROT; HELVETIUS; D\\'HOLBACH.--It was particularly on David Hume\\r\\nthat Diderot depended. The difference, which is great, is that David Hume\\r\\nin his scepticism remained a grave, reserved man, well-bred and discreet,\\r\\nand was only a sceptic, whilst Diderot was violent in denial and a man of\\r\\nparadoxes and jests, both impertinent and cynical.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is almost ridiculous in a summary history of philosophy to name as\\r\\nsub-Diderots, if one may so express it, Helvetius and D\\'Holbach, who were\\r\\nmerely wits believing themselves philosophers, and who were not always\\r\\nwits.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONDILLAC.--Condillac belongs to another category. He was a very\\r\\nserious philosopher and a vigorous thinker. An exaggerated disciple of\\r\\nLocke, while the latter admitted sensation _and_ reflection as the\\r\\norigin of ideas, Condillac admitted only pure sensation and transformed\\r\\nsensation--that is to say, sensation transforming itself. The definition of\\r\\nman that he deduces from these principles is very celebrated and it is\\r\\ninteresting: \"The _ego_ of each man is only the collection of the\\r\\nsensations that he feels and of those his memory recalls; it is the\\r\\nconsciousness of what he is combined with the recollection of what he has\\r\\nbeen.\" To Condillac, the idea is a sensation which has fixed itself and\\r\\nwhich has been renewed and vivified by others; desire is a sensation which\\r\\nwishes to be repeated and seeks what opportunity offers for its renewal,\\r\\nand the will itself is only the most potent of desires. Condillac was\\r\\nvoluntarily and systematically limited, but his system is well knit and\\r\\npresented in admirably clear and precise language.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI\\r\\n\\r\\nKANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKant Reconstructed all Philosophy by Supporting it on Morality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKNOWLEDGE.--Kant, born at K\\xc3\\xb6nigsberg in 1724, was professor there\\r\\nall his life and died there in 1804. Nothing happened to him except the\\r\\npossession of genius. He had commenced with the theological philosophy in\\r\\nuse in his country, that of Wolf, which on broad lines was that of\\r\\nLeibnitz. But he early read David Hume, and the train of thought of the\\r\\nsceptical Scotsman at least gave him the idea of submitting all philosophic\\r\\nideas to a severe and close criticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe first of all asked himself what the true value is of our knowledge and\\r\\nwhat knowledge is. We believe generally that it is the things which give us\\r\\nthe knowledge that we have of them. But, rather, is it not we who impose on\\r\\nthings the forms of our mind and is not the knowledge that we believe we\\r\\nhave of things only the knowledge which we take of the laws of our mind by\\r\\napplying it to things? This is what is most probable. We perceive the\\r\\nthings by moulds, so to speak, which are in ourselves and which give them\\r\\ntheir shapes and they would be shapeless and chaotic were it\\r\\notherwise. Consequently, it is necessary to distinguish the matter and the\\r\\nform of our knowledge: the matter of the knowledge is the things\\r\\nthemselves. The form of our knowledge is ourselves: \"Our experimental\\r\\nknowledge is a compound of what we receive from impressions and of what our\\r\\nindividual faculty of knowing draws from itself on the occasion of these\\r\\nimpressions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSENSIBILITY; UNDERSTANDING; REASON.--Those who believe that all we\\r\\nthink proceeds from the senses are therefore wrong; so too are those wrong\\r\\nwho believe that all we think proceeds from ourselves. To say, Matter is an\\r\\nappearance, and to say, Ideas are appearances, are equally false doctrines.\\r\\nNow we know by sensibility, by understanding, and by reason. By sensibility\\r\\nwe receive the impression of phenomena; by the understanding we impose on\\r\\nthese impressions their forms, and link them up together; by reason we give\\r\\nourselves general ideas of things--universal ones, going beyond or\\r\\nbelieving they go beyond the data, even when linked up and systematized.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us analyse sensibility, understanding, and reason. Sensibility already\\r\\nhas the forms it imposes on things. These forms are time and space. Time\\r\\nand space are not given us by matter like colour, smell, taste, or sound;\\r\\nthey are not perceived by the senses; they are therefore the forms of our\\r\\nsensibility: we can feel only according to time and space, by lodging what\\r\\nwe feel in space and time; these are the conditions of sensibility.\\r\\nPhenomena are thus perceived by us under the laws of space and of time.\\r\\nWhat do they become in us? They are seized by the understanding, which also\\r\\nhas its forms, its powers of classification, of arrangement, and of\\r\\nconnection. Its forms or powers, or, putting it more exactly, its active\\r\\nforms are, for example, the conception of quantity being always equal:\\r\\nthrough all phenomena the quantity of substance remains always the same;\\r\\nthe conception of causality: everything has a cause and every cause has an\\r\\neffect and it is ever thus. Those are the conditions of our understanding,\\r\\nthose without which we do not understand and the forms which within us we\\r\\nimpose on all things in order to understand them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is thus that we know the world; which is tantamount to stating that the\\r\\nworld exists, so far as we are concerned, only so long as we think\\r\\nso. Reason would go further: it would seize the most general, the\\r\\nuniversal, beyond experience, beyond the limited and restricted\\r\\nsystematizations established by the understanding; to know, for instance,\\r\\nthe first cause of all causes, the last and collective end, so to speak, of\\r\\nall purposes; to know \"why is there something?\" and \"in view of what end is\\r\\nthere something?\" in fact, to answer all the questions of infinity and\\r\\neternity. Be sure that it cannot. How could it? It only operates, can only\\r\\noperate, on the data of experience and the systematizations of the\\r\\nunderstanding, which classify experience but do not go beyond it. Only\\r\\noperating upon that, having nothing except that as matter, how could it\\r\\nitself go beyond experience? It cannot. It is only (a highly important\\r\\nfact, and one which must on no account be forgotten)--it is only a sign,\\r\\nmerely a witness. It is the sign that the human spirit has need of the\\r\\nabsolute; it is itself that need; without that it would not exist; it is\\r\\nthe witness of our invincible insistence on knowing and of our tendency to\\r\\nestimate that we know nothing if we only know something; it is itself that\\r\\ninsistence and that tendency: without that it would not exist. Let us pause\\r\\nthere for the moment. Man knows of nature only those impressions which he\\r\\nreceives from it, co-ordinated by the forms of sensibility, and further the\\r\\nideas of it which he preserves co-ordinated by the forms of his\\r\\nunderstanding. This is very little. It is all, if we consider only pure\\r\\nreason.\\r\\n\\r\\nPRACTICAL REASON.--_But_ there is perhaps another reason, or\\r\\nanother aspect of reason--to wit, practical reason. What is practical\\r\\nreason? Something in us tells us: you should act, and you should act in\\r\\nsuch a way; you should act rightly; this is not right, so do not do it;\\r\\nthat is right, do it. As a fact this is uncontestable. What is the\\r\\nexplanation? From what data of experience, from what systematization of\\r\\nthe understanding has our mind borrowed this? Where has it got it? Does\\r\\nnature yield obedience to a \"you ought\"? Not at all. It exists, and it\\r\\ndevelops and it goes its way, according to our way of seeing it in time and\\r\\nspace, and that is all. Does the understanding furnish the idea of \"you\\r\\nought\"? By no means; it gives us ideas of quantity, of quality, of cause\\r\\nand effect, etc., and that is all; there is no \"you ought\" in all\\r\\nthat. Therefore this \"you ought\" is purely human; it is the only principle\\r\\nwhich comes exactly from ourselves only. It might therefore well be the\\r\\nvery foundation of us.--It may be an illusion.--No doubt, but it is highly\\r\\nremarkable that it exists, though nothing gives it birth or is of a nature\\r\\nto give it birth. An illusion is a weakness of the senses or an error of\\r\\nlogic and is thus explained; but an illusion in itself and by itself and\\r\\nonly proceeding from itself is most singular and not to be explained as an\\r\\nillusion. Hence it remains that it is a reality, a reality of our nature,\\r\\nand given the coercive force of its voice and act, it is the most real\\r\\nreality there is in us.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE.--Thus, at least, thought Kant, and he\\r\\nsaid: There is a practical reason which does not go beyond experience and\\r\\ndoes not seek to go beyond it; but which does not depend on it, is\\r\\nabsolutely separated from it, and is its own (human) experience by\\r\\nitself. This practical reason says to us: you ought to do good. The crowd\\r\\ncall it conscience; I call it in a general way practical reason, and I call\\r\\nit the categorical imperative when I take it in its principle, without\\r\\ntaking into account the applications which I foresee. Why this name? To\\r\\ndistinguish it clearly; for we feel ourselves commanded by other things\\r\\nthan it, but not in the same way. We feel ourselves commanded by prudence,\\r\\nfor instance, which tells us: do not run down that staircase _if_ you\\r\\ndo not wish to break your neck; we feel ourselves commanded by the\\r\\nconventions which say: be polite _if_ you do not wish men to leave you\\r\\nseverely alone, etc. But conscience does not say _if_ to us: it says\\r\\nbluntly \"you ought\" without consideration of what may or may not happen,\\r\\nand it is even part of its character to scorn all consideration of\\r\\nconsequences. It would tell us: run down that staircase to save that child\\r\\neven at the risk of breaking your neck. Because of that I call all the\\r\\nother commandments made to us hypothetical imperatives and that of\\r\\nconscience, alone, the categorical or absolute imperative. Here is a\\r\\ndefinite result.\\r\\n\\r\\nMORALITY, THE LAW OF MAN.--Yet reflect: if the foregoing be true,\\r\\nmorality is the very law of man, his especial law, as the law of the tree\\r\\nis to spread in roots and branches. Well. But for man to be able to obey\\r\\nhis law he must be free, must be able to do what he wishes. That is\\r\\ncertain. Then it must be believed that we are free, for were we not, we\\r\\ncould not obey our law; and the moral law would be absurd. The moral law is\\r\\nthe _sign_ that we are free. Compared to this, all the other proofs of\\r\\nfreedom are worthless or weak. We are free because we must be so in order\\r\\nto do the good which our law commands us to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us examine further. I do what is right in order to obey the law; but,\\r\\nwhen I have done it, I have the idea that it would be unjust that I should\\r\\nbe punished for it, or that I should not be rewarded for it, that it would\\r\\nbe unjust were there not concordance between right and happiness. As it\\r\\nhappens, virtue is seldom rewarded in this world and often is even\\r\\npunished; it draws misfortune or evil on him who practises it. Would not\\r\\nthat be the sign that there are two worlds of which we see only one? Would\\r\\nnot that be the sign that virtue unrewarded here will be rewarded elsewhere\\r\\n_in order that there should not be injustice?_ It is highly probable\\r\\nthat this is so.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut for that it is necessary that the soul be immortal. It is so, since it\\r\\nis necessary that it should be. The moral law is accomplished and\\r\\nconsummated in rewards or penalties beyond the grave, which pre-suppose the\\r\\nimmortality of the soul. All the other proofs of the immortality of the\\r\\nsoul are worthless or feeble beside this one which demonstrates that were\\r\\nthere no immortality of the soul there would be no morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nGOD.--And, finally, if justice is one day to be done, this supposes\\r\\na Judge. It is neither ourselves who in another life will do justice to\\r\\nourselves nor yet some force of circumstances which will do it to us. It is\\r\\nnecessary to have an intelligence conceiving justice and a will to realise\\r\\nit. God is this intelligence and this will.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the other proofs of God are weak or worthless beside this one. The\\r\\nexistence of God has been deduced from the idea of God: if we have the idea\\r\\nof God, it is necessary that He should exist. A weak proof, for we can have\\r\\nan idea which does not correspond with an object. The existence of God has\\r\\nbeen deduced from the idea of causality; for all that is, a cause is\\r\\nnecessary, this cause is God. A weak proof, for things being as they are,\\r\\nthere is necessity for ... cause; but a cause and a _single_ cause,\\r\\nwhy? There could be a series of causes to infinity and thus the cause of\\r\\nthe world could be the world itself. The existence of God has been deduced\\r\\nfrom the idea of design well carried out. The composition, the ordering of\\r\\nthis world is admired; this world is well made; it is like a clock. The\\r\\nclock supposes a clock-maker; the fine composition of the world supposes an\\r\\nintelligence which conceived a work to be made and which made it. Perhaps;\\r\\nbut this consideration only leads to the idea of a manipulation of matter,\\r\\nof a demiurge, as the Greeks said, of an architect, but not to the idea of\\r\\na _Creator;_ it may even lead only to the idea of several architects\\r\\nand the Greeks perfectly possessed the idea of a fine artistic order\\r\\nexisting in the world when they believed in a great number of deities. This\\r\\nproof also is therefore weak, although Kant always treats it with respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sole convincing proof is the existence of the moral law in the heart of\\r\\nman. For the moral law to be accomplished, for it not to be merely a tyrant\\r\\nover man, for it to be realised in all its fullness, weighing on man here\\r\\nbut rewarding him infinitely elsewhere, which means there is justice in all\\r\\nthat, it is necessary that somewhere there should be an absolute realizer\\r\\nof justice. God must exist for the world to be moral.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is it necessary for the world to be moral? Because an immoral world\\r\\nwith even a single moral being in it would be a very strange thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, whilst the majority of philosophers deduced human liberty from God,\\r\\nand the spirituality of the soul from human liberty, the immortality of the\\r\\nsoul from human spirituality, and morality from human immortality, Kant\\r\\nstarts from morality as from the incontestable fact, and from morality\\r\\ndeduces liberty, and from liberty spirituality, and God from the\\r\\nimmortality of the soul with the consequent realization of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has effected an extraordinarily powerful reversal of the argument\\r\\ngenerally employed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE INFLUENCE OF KANT.--The influence of Kant has been incomparable\\r\\nor, if you will, comparable only to those of Plato, Zeno, and\\r\\nEpicurus. Half at least of the European philosophy of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury has proceeded from him and is closely connected with him. Even in\\r\\nour own day, pragmatism, as it is called--that is, the doctrine which lays\\r\\ndown that morality is the measure of truth and that an idea is true only if\\r\\nit be morally useful--is perhaps an alteration of Kantism, a Kantian\\r\\nheresy, but entirely penetrated with and, as it were, excited by the spirit\\r\\nof Kant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NINETEENTH CENTURY: GERMANY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great reconstructors of the world, analogous to the\\r\\nfirst philosophers of antiquity.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat general systems: Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFICHTE.--Fichte, embarrassed by what remained of experience in the\\r\\nideas of Kant, by the part, restricted though it was, which Kant left to\\r\\nthings in the external world, completely suppressed the external world,\\r\\nlike Berkeley, and affirmed the existence of the human _ego_\\r\\nalone. Kant said that the world furnished us with the matter of the idea\\r\\nand that we furnished the form. According to Fichte, form and matter alike\\r\\ncame from us. What then is sensation? It is nothing except the pause of the\\r\\n_ego_ encountering what is not self, the impact of the _ego_\\r\\nagainst what limits it.--But then the external world does exist, for how\\r\\ncould our mind be encountered by nothing and there be an impact of our mind\\r\\nagainst nothing?--But this non-self that encounters self is precisely a\\r\\nproduct of self, a product of the imagination which creates an object,\\r\\nwhich projects outside us an appearance before which we pause as before\\r\\nsomething real which should be outside us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory is very difficult to understand, but indicates a very fine\\r\\neffort of the mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet outside ourselves is there anything? There is pure spirit, God. What\\r\\nis God? For Fichte He is moral order (a very evident recollection of\\r\\nKant). Morality is God and God is morality. We are in God, and it is the\\r\\nwhole of religion, when we do our duty without any regard to the\\r\\nconsequences of our actions; we are outside God, and it is atheism, when we\\r\\nact in view of what results our actions may have. And thus morality and\\r\\nreligion run into one another, and religion is only morality in its\\r\\nplenitude and complete morality is the whole of religion. \"The holy, the\\r\\nbeautiful, and the good are the immediate apparition [if it could be] in us\\r\\nof the essence of God.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHELLING.--Schelling desired to correct what, according to him, was\\r\\ntoo radical in the idealism of Fichte. He restored the external world; for\\r\\nhim the _non-ego_ and the _ego_ both exist and the two are\\r\\n_nature_, nature which is the object in the world regarded by man, the\\r\\nsubject when it regards man, subject and object according to the case; in\\r\\nitself and in its totality neither subject nor object, but absolute,\\r\\nunlimited, indeterminate. Confronting this world (that is nature and man)\\r\\nthere is another world which is God. God is the infinite and the perfect,\\r\\nand particularly the perfect and infinite will. The world that we know is a\\r\\ndebasement from that without our being able to conceive how the perfect can\\r\\nbe degraded, and how an emanation of the perfect can be imperfect and how\\r\\nthe non-being can come out of being, since relatively to the infinite, the\\r\\nfinite has no existence, and relatively to perfection, the imperfect is\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears however that it is thus, and that the world is an emanation of\\r\\nGod in which He degrades Himself and a degradation of God such that it\\r\\nopposes itself to Him as nothing to everything. It is a fall. The fall of\\r\\nman in the Scriptures may give an idea, however distant, of that.\\r\\n\\r\\nHEGEL.--Hegel, a contemporary of Schelling, and often in\\r\\ncontradiction to him, is the philosopher of \"_becoming_\" and of the\\r\\nidea which always \"becomes\" something. The essence of all is the idea, but\\r\\nthe idea in progress; the idea makes itself a thing according to a rational\\r\\nlaw which is inherent in it, and the thing makes itself an idea in the\\r\\nsense that the idea contemplating the thing it has become thinks it and\\r\\nfills itself with it in order to become yet another thing, always following\\r\\nthe rational law; and this very evolution, all this evolution, all this\\r\\nbecoming, is that absolute for which we are always searching behind things,\\r\\nat the root of things, and which is _in_ the things themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rationally active is everything; and activity and reality are synonyms,\\r\\nand all reality is active, and what is not active is not real, and what is\\r\\nnot active has no existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet not this activity be regarded as always advancing forward; the becoming\\r\\nis not a river which flows; activity is activity and retro-activity. The\\r\\ncause is cause of the effect, but also the effect is cause of its cause.\\r\\nIn fact the cause would not be cause if it had no effect; it is therefore,\\r\\nthanks to its effect, because of its effect, that the cause is cause; and\\r\\ntherefore the effect is the cause of the cause as much as the cause is\\r\\ncause of the effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nA government is the effect of the character of a people, and the character\\r\\nof a people is the effect also of its government; my son proceeds from me,\\r\\nbut he reacts on me, and because I am his father I have the character which\\r\\nI gave him, more pronounced than before, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, all effect is cause as all cause is effect, which everybody has\\r\\nrecognized, but in addition all effect is cause of its cause and in\\r\\nconsequence, to speak in common language, all effect is cause forward and\\r\\nbackward, and the line of causes and effects is not a straight line but a\\r\\ncircle.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DEISM OF HEGEL.--God disappears from all that. No, Hegel is very\\r\\nformally a deist, but he sees God in the total of things and not outside\\r\\nthings, yet distinct. In what way distinct? In this, that God is the\\r\\ntotality of things considered not in themselves but in the spirit that\\r\\nanimates them and the force that urges them, and because the soul is of\\r\\nnecessity in the body, united to the body, that is no reason why it should\\r\\nnot be distinct from it. And having taken up this position, Hegel is a\\r\\ndeist and even accepts proofs of the existence of God which are regarded by\\r\\nsome as hackneyed. He accepts them, only holding them not exactly as\\r\\nproofs, but as reasons for belief, and as highly faithful descriptions of\\r\\nthe necessary elevation of the soul to God. For example, the ancient\\r\\nphilosophers proved the existence of God by the contemplation of the\\r\\nmarvels of the universe: \"That is not a \\'proof,\\'\" said Hegel, \"that is not\\r\\na proof, but it is a great reason for belief; for it is an exposition, a\\r\\nvery exact although incomplete account rendered of the fact that by\\r\\ncontemplation of the world the human mind rises to God.\" Now this fact is\\r\\nof singular importance: it indicates that it is impossible to think\\r\\nstrongly without thinking of God. \"When the passage [although\\r\\ninsufficiently logical] from the finite to the infinite does not take\\r\\nplace, it may be said that there is no thought.\" Now this is a reason for\\r\\nbelief.\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the same fashion, the philosophers have said \"from the moment that we\\r\\nimagine God, the reason is that He is.\" Kant ridiculed this proof. Granted,\\r\\nit is not an invincible proof, but this fact alone that we cannot imagine\\r\\nGod without affirming His existence indicates a tendency of our mind which\\r\\nis to relate finite thought to infinite thought and not to admit an\\r\\nimperfect thought which should not have its source in a perfect thought;\\r\\nand that is rather an invincible belief than a proof, but that this belief\\r\\nis invincible and necessary in itself is an extremely commanding proof,\\r\\nalthough a relative one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY.--The philosophy of the human mind and\\r\\npolitical philosophy according to Hegel are these. Primitive man is mind,\\r\\nreason, conscience, but he is so only potentially, as the philosophers\\r\\nexpress it; that is to say, he is so only in that he is capable of becoming\\r\\nso. Really, practically, he is only instincts: he is egoist like the\\r\\nanimals [it should be said like the greater part of the animals], and\\r\\nfollows his egoistical appetites. Society, in whatever manner it has\\r\\nmanaged to constitute itself, transforms him and his \"becoming\" commences.\\r\\nFrom the sexual instinct it makes marriage, from capture it forms regulated\\r\\nproprietorship, out of defence against violence it makes legal punishment,\\r\\netc. Hence-forth, and all his evolution tends to that, man proceeds to\\r\\nsubstitute in himself the general will for the particular will; he tends to\\r\\ndisindividualize himself. The general will, founded upon general utility,\\r\\nis that the man be married, father, head of a family, good husband, good\\r\\nfather, good relative, good citizen. All that man ought to be in\\r\\nconsideration of the general will which he has put in the place of his own,\\r\\nand which he has made his own will. That is the first advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is realized (always imperfectly) in the smallest societies, in the\\r\\ncities, in the little Greek republics, for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is the second advance. By war, by conquest, by annexations, by more\\r\\ngentle means when possible, the stronger cities subdue the weaker, and the\\r\\ngreat State is created. The great State has a more important part than the\\r\\ncity; it continues to substitute the general will for the particular wills;\\r\\nbut, _in addition,_ it is an idea, a great civilizing idea,\\r\\nbenevolent, elevating, aggrandizing, to which private interests must and\\r\\nshould be sacrificed. Such were the Romans who considered themselves, not\\r\\nwithout reason, as the legislators and civilizers of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE IDEAL FORM OF STATE.--Putting aside for a while the continuation\\r\\nof this subject, what political form should the great State take to conform\\r\\nto its destiny? Assuredly the monarchical form; for the republican form is\\r\\nalways too individualist. To Hegel, the Greeks and even the Romans seem to\\r\\nhave conceded too much to individual liberty or to the interests of class,\\r\\nof caste; they possessed an imperfect idea of the rights and functions of\\r\\nthe State. The ideal form of the State is monarchy. It is necessary for the\\r\\nState to be contracted, gathered up, and personified in a prince who can be\\r\\npersonally loved, who can be reverenced, which is precisely what is\\r\\nneeded. These great States are only really great if they possess strong\\r\\ncohesion; it is therefore necessary that they should be nationalities, as\\r\\nit is called--that is, that they should be inwardly very united and highly\\r\\nhomogeneous by community of race, religion, customs, language, etc. The\\r\\nidea to be realized by a State can only be accomplished if there be a\\r\\nsufficient community of ideas in the people constituting it. However the\\r\\ngreat State will be able to, and even ought to, conquer and annex the small\\r\\nones in order to become stronger and more capable, being stronger, of\\r\\nrealizing its idea. Only this should be done merely when it is certain or\\r\\nclearly apparent that it represents an idea as against a people which does\\r\\nnot, or that it presents a better, greater, and nobler idea than that\\r\\nrepresented by the people it attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWAR.--But, as each people will always find its own idea finer than\\r\\nthat of another, how is this to be recognized?--By victory itself. It is\\r\\nvictory which proves that a people ... was stronger than another!--Not\\r\\nonly stronger materially but representing a greater, more practical, more\\r\\nfruitful idea than the other; for it is precisely the idea which supports a\\r\\npeople and renders it strong. Thus, victory is the sign of the moral\\r\\nsuperiority of a people, and in consequence force indicates where right is\\r\\nand is indistinguishable from right itself, and we must not say as may\\r\\nalready perhaps have been said: \"Might excels right,\" but \"Might is right\"\\r\\nor \"Right is might.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example [Hegel might have said], France was \"apparently\" within her\\r\\nrights in endeavouring to conquer Europe from 1792 to 1815; for she\\r\\nrepresented an idea, the revolutionary idea, which she might consider, and\\r\\nwhich many besides the French did consider, an advance and a civilizing\\r\\nidea; but she was beaten, _which proves_ that the idea was false; and\\r\\nbefore this demonstration by events is it not true that the republican or\\r\\nCaesarian idea is inferior to that of traditional monarchy? Hegel would\\r\\ncertainly have reasoned thus on this point.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore war is eternal and must be so. It is history itself, being the\\r\\ncondition of history; it is even the evolution of humanity, being the\\r\\ncondition of that evolution; there-fore, it is divine. Only it is purifying\\r\\nitself; formerly men only fought, or practically always, from ambition; now\\r\\nwars are waged for principles, to effect the triumph of an idea which has a\\r\\nfuture, and which contains the future, over one that is out of date and\\r\\ndecayed. The future will see a succession of the triumphs of might which,\\r\\nby definition, will be triumphs of right and which will be triumphs of\\r\\nincreasingly fine ideas over ideas that are barbarous and justly condemned\\r\\nto perish.\\r\\n\\r\\nHegel has exercised great influence on the ideas of the German people both\\r\\nin internal and external politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nART, SCIENCE, AND RELIGION.--The ideas of Hegel on art, science, and\\r\\nreligion are the following: Under the shelter of the State which is\\r\\nnecessary for their peaceful development in security and liberty, science,\\r\\nliterature, art, and religion pursue aims not superior to but other than\\r\\nthose of the State. They seek, without detaching the individual from the\\r\\nsociety, to unite him to the whole world. Science makes him know all it\\r\\ncan of nature and its laws; literature, by studying man in himself and in\\r\\nhis relations with the world, imbues him with the sentiment of the possible\\r\\nconcordance of the individual with the universe; the arts make him love\\r\\ncreation by unravelling and bringing into the light and into relief all\\r\\nthat is beautiful in it relatively to man, and all that in consequence\\r\\nshould render it lovely, respected, and dear to him; religion, finally,\\r\\nseeks to be a bond between all men and a bond between all men and God; it\\r\\nsketches the plan of universal brotherhood which is ideally the last state\\r\\nof humanity, a state which no doubt it will never attain, but which it is\\r\\nessential it should imagine and believe to be possible, without which it\\r\\nalways would be drawn towards animality more and much more than it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hegelian philosophy has exercised an immense influence throughout\\r\\nEurope not only on philosophic studies, but on history, art, and\\r\\nliterature. It may be regarded as the last \"universal system\" and as the\\r\\nmost daring that has been attempted by the human mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCHOPENHAUER.--Schopenhauer was the philosopher of the\\r\\nwill. Persuaded, like Leibnitz, that man is an epitome and a picture of the\\r\\nworld, and that the world resembles us (which is hypothetical), he takes up\\r\\nthe thought of Leibnitz, changing and transforming it thus: All the\\r\\nuniverse is not thought, but all the universe is will; thought is only an\\r\\naccident of the will which appears in the superior animals; but the will,\\r\\nwhich is the foundation of man, is the foundation of all; the universe is a\\r\\ncompound of wills that act. All beings are wills which possess organs\\r\\nconformed to their purpose. It is _the will to be_ which gave claws to\\r\\nthe lion, tusks to the boar, and intelligence to man, because he was the\\r\\nmost unarmed of animals, just as to one who becomes blind it gives\\r\\nextraordinarily sensitive and powerful sense of hearing, smell, and\\r\\ntouch. Plants strive towards light by their tops and towards moisture by\\r\\ntheir roots; the seed turns itself in the earth to send forth its stalk\\r\\nupwards and its rootlet downward. In minerals there are \"constant\\r\\ntendencies\" which are nothing but obscure wills; what we currently term\\r\\nweight, fluidity, impenetrability, electricity, chemical affinities, are\\r\\nnothing but natural wills or inconscient wills. Because of this, the\\r\\ndiverse wills opposing and clashing with one another, the world is a war of\\r\\nall against all and of _everything_ literally against _everything_; and\\r\\nthe world is a scene of carnage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe truth is that will is an evil and is the evil. What is needed for\\r\\nhappiness is to kill the will, to destroy the wish to be.--But this would\\r\\nbe the end of existence?--And in fact to be no more or not to be at all is\\r\\nthe true happiness and it would be necessary to blow up the whole world in\\r\\nan explosion for it to escape unhappiness. At least, as Buddhism desired\\r\\nand, in some degree, though less, Christianity also, it is necessary to\\r\\nmake an approach to death by a kind of reduction to the absolute minimum of\\r\\nwill, by detachment and renunciation pushed as far as can be.\\r\\n\\r\\nNIETZSCHE.--A very respectful but highly independent and untractable\\r\\npupil of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche \"turns Schopenhauer inside out\" as it\\r\\nwere, saying: Yes, assuredly the will to be is everything; but precisely\\r\\nbecause of that it is essential not to oppose but to follow it and to\\r\\nfollow it as far as it will lead us. But is it not true that it will lead\\r\\nto suffering? Be sure of that, but in suffering there is an intoxication of\\r\\npain which is quite comprehensible; for it is the intoxication of the will\\r\\nin action; and this intoxication is an enjoyment too and in any case a good\\r\\nthing; for it is the end to which we are urged by our nature composed of\\r\\nwill and of hunger for existence. Now wisdom, like happiness, is to follow\\r\\nour nature. The happiness and wisdom of man is to obey his will for power,\\r\\nas the wisdom and happiness of water is to flow towards the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom these ideas is derived a morality of violence which can be\\r\\nlegitimately regarded as immoral and which, in any case, is neither\\r\\nBuddhist nor Christian, but which is susceptible of several\\r\\ninterpretations, all the more so because Nietzsche, who was a poet, never\\r\\nfails, whilst always artistically very fine, to fall into plenty of\\r\\ncontradictions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NINETEENTH CENTURY: ENGLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Doctrines of Evolution and of Transformism:\\r\\nLamarck (French), Darwin, Spencer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTRANSFORMISM AND EVOLUTION.--The great philosophic invention of the\\r\\nEnglish of the nineteenth century has been the idea, based on a wide\\r\\nknowledge of natural history, that there never was creation. The animal\\r\\nspecies had been considered by all the philosophers (except Epicurus and\\r\\nthe Epicureans) as being created once and for all and remaining\\r\\ninvariable. Nothing of the kind. Matter, eternally fruitful, has\\r\\ntransformed itself first into plants, then into lower animals, then into\\r\\nhigher animals, then into man; our ancestor is the fish; tracing back yet\\r\\nmore remotely, our ancestor is the plant. Transformation (hence the name\\r\\n_transformism_), discrimination and separation of species, the\\r\\nstrongest individuals of each kind alone surviving and creating descendants\\r\\nin their image which constitute a species; evolution (hence the name\\r\\n_evolutionism_) of living nature thus operating from the lowest types\\r\\nto the highest and therefore the most complicated; there is nothing but\\r\\nthat in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAMARCK; DARWIN; SPENCER.--The Frenchman Lamarck in the eighteenth\\r\\ncentury had already conceived this idea; Darwin, purely a naturalist, set\\r\\nit forth clearly, Spencer again stated it and drew from it consequences of\\r\\ngeneral philosophy. Thus, to Spencer, the evolutionist theory contains no\\r\\nimmorality. On the contrary, the progressive transformation of the human\\r\\nspecies is an ascent towards morality; from egoism is born altruism because\\r\\nthe species, seeking its best law and its best condition of happiness,\\r\\nperceives a greater happiness in altruism; seeking its best law and its\\r\\nbest condition of happiness, perceives that a greater happiness lies in\\r\\norder, regular life, social life, etc.; so that humanity raises itself to a\\r\\nhigher and yet higher morality by the mere fact of adapting itself better\\r\\nto the conditions of the life of humanity. Morality develops\\r\\nphysiologically as the germ becomes the stem and the bud becomes the\\r\\nflower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for religion it is the domain of the unknowable. That is not to assert\\r\\nthat it is nothing. On the contrary it is something formidable and\\r\\nimmense. It is the feeling that something, apart from all that we know,\\r\\nsurpasses us and that we shall never know it. Now this feeling at the same\\r\\ntime maintains us in a humility highly favourable to the health of the soul\\r\\nand also in a serene confidence in the mysterious being who presides over\\r\\nuniversal evolution and who, no doubt, is the all-powerful and eternal soul\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NINETEENTH CENTURY: FRANCE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Eclectic School: Victor Cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Positivist School: Auguste Comte.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kantist School: Renouvier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent and Complex Positivists: Taine, Renan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLAROMIGUI\\xc3\\x88RE: ROYER-COLLARD.--Emerging from the school of Condillac,\\r\\nFrance saw Laromigui\\xc3\\xa8re who was a sort of softened Condillac, less\\r\\ntrenchant, and not insensible to the influence of Rousseau; but he was\\r\\nlittle more than a clear and elegant professor of philosophy. Royer-Collard\\r\\nintroduced into France the Scottish philosophy (Thomas Reid, Dugald\\r\\nStewart) and did not depart from it or go beyond it; but he set it forth\\r\\nwith magnificent authority and with a remarkable invention of clear and\\r\\nmagisterial formulae.\\r\\n\\r\\nMAINE DE BIRAN.--Maine de Biran was a renovator. He attached himself\\r\\nto Descartes linking the chain anew that had for so long been\\r\\ninterrupted. He devoted his attention to the notion of _ego_. In full\\r\\nreaction from the \"sensualism\" of Condillac, he restored a due activity to\\r\\nthe _ego_; he made it a force not restricted to the reception of\\r\\nsensations, which transform themselves, but one which seized upon,\\r\\nelaborated, linked together, and combined them. For him then, as for\\r\\nDescartes, but from a fresh point of view, the voluntary deed is the\\r\\nprimitive deed of the soul and the will is the foundation of man. Also, the\\r\\nwill is not all man; man has, so to say, three lives superimposed but very\\r\\nclosely inter-united and which cannot do without one another: the life of\\r\\nsensation, the life of will, and the life of love. The life of sensation is\\r\\nalmost passive, with a commencement of activity which consists in\\r\\nclassifying and organizing the sensations; the life of will is properly\\r\\nspeaking the \"human\" life; the life of love is the life of activity and yet\\r\\nagain of will, but which unites the human with the divine life. By the\\r\\ningenious and profound subtlety of his analyses, Maine de Biran has placed\\r\\nhimself in the front rank of French thinkers and, in any case, he is one of\\r\\nthe most original.\\r\\n\\r\\nVICTOR COUSIN AND HIS DISCIPLES.--Victor Cousin, who appears to have\\r\\nbeen influenced almost concurrently by Maine de Biran, Royer-Collard, and\\r\\nthe German philosophy, yielded rapidly to a tendency which is\\r\\ncharacteristically French and is also, perhaps, good, and which consists in\\r\\nseeing \"some good in all the opinions,\" and he was eclectic, that is, a\\r\\nborrower. His maxim, which he had no doubt read in Leibnitz, was that the\\r\\nsystems are \"true in what they affirm and false in what they deny.\"\\r\\nStarting thence, he rested upon both the English and German philosophy,\\r\\ncorrecting one by the other. Personally his tendency was to make\\r\\nmetaphysics come from philosophy and to prove God by the human soul and the\\r\\nrelations of God with the world by the relations of man with matter. To him\\r\\nGod is always an augmented human soul. All philosophies, not to mention all\\r\\nreligions, have rather an inclination to consider things thus: but this\\r\\ntendency is particularly marked in Cousin. In the course of his career,\\r\\nwhich was diversified, for he was at one time a professor and at another a\\r\\nstatesman, he varied somewhat, because before 1830 he became very Hegelian,\\r\\nand after 1830 he harked back towards Descartes, endeavouring especially to\\r\\nmake philosophic instruction a moral priesthood; highly cautious, very\\r\\nwell-balanced, feeling great distrust of the unassailable temerities of the\\r\\none and in sympathetic relations with the other. What has remained of this\\r\\neclecticism is an excellent thing, the great regard for the _history_\\r\\nof philosophy, which had never been held in honour in France and which,\\r\\nsince Cousin, has never ceased to be so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal disciples of Cousin were Jouffroy, Damiron, Emile Saisset,\\r\\nand the great moralist Jules Simon, well-known because of the important\\r\\npolitical part he played.\\r\\n\\r\\nLAMENNAIS.--Lamennais, long celebrated for his great book, _Essay\\r\\non Indifference in the Matter of Religion_, then, when he had severed\\r\\nhimself from Rome, by his _Words of a Believer_ and other works of\\r\\nrevolutionary spirit, was above all a publicist; but he was a philosopher,\\r\\nproperly speaking, in his _Sketch of a Philosophy_. To him, God is\\r\\nneither the Creator, as understood by the early Christians, nor the Being\\r\\nfrom whom the world emanates, as others have thought. He has not created\\r\\nthe world from nothing; but He has created it; He created it from Himself,\\r\\nHe made it issue from His substance; and He made it issue by a purely\\r\\nvoluntary act. He created it in His own image; it is not man alone who is\\r\\nin the image of God, but the whole world. The three Persons of God, that\\r\\nis, the three characteristics, power, intelligence, and love are\\r\\nfound--diminished and disfigured indeed, but yet are to be found--in every\\r\\nbeing in the universe. They are especially our own three powers, under the\\r\\nform of will, reason, sympathy; they are also the three powers of society,\\r\\nunder the forms of executive power, deliberation, and fraternity. Every\\r\\nbeing, individual or collective, has in it a principle of death if it\\r\\ncannot reproduce however imperfectly all the three terms of this trinity\\r\\nwithout the loss of one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAUGUSTE COMTE.--Auguste Comte, a mathematician, versed also in all\\r\\nsciences, constructed a pre-eminently negative philosophy in spite of his\\r\\ngreat pretension to replace the negations of the eighteenth century by a\\r\\npositive doctrine; above all else he denied all authority and denied to\\r\\nmetaphysics the right of existence. Metaphysics ought not to exist, do not\\r\\nexist, are a mere nothing. We know nothing, we can know nothing, about the\\r\\ncommencement or the end of things, or yet their essence or their object;\\r\\nphilosophy has always laid down as its task a general explanation of the\\r\\nuniverse; it is precisely this general explanation, all general explanation\\r\\nof the aggregate of things, which is impossible. This is the negative part\\r\\nof \"positivism.\" It is the only one which has endured and which is the\\r\\n_credo_ or rather the _non credo_ of a fairly large number of\\r\\nminds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe affirmative part of the ideas of Comte was this: what can be done is to\\r\\nmake a classification of sciences and a philosophy of history. The\\r\\nclassification of sciences according to Comte, proceeding from the most\\r\\nsimple to the most complex--that is, from mathematics to astronomy,\\r\\nphysics, chemistry, biology to end at sociology, is generally considered by\\r\\nthe learned as interesting but arbitrary. The philosophy of history,\\r\\naccording to Comte, is this: humanity passes through three states:\\r\\ntheological, metaphysical, positive. The theological state (antiquity)\\r\\nconsists in man explaining everything by continual miracles; the\\r\\nmetaphysical state (modern times) consists in man explaining everything by\\r\\nideas, which he still continues to consider somewhat as beings, by\\r\\nabstractions, entities, vital principle, attraction, gravitation, soul,\\r\\nfaculty of the soul, etc. The positive state consists in that man explains\\r\\nand will explain all things, or rather limits himself and will limit\\r\\nhimself to verifying them, by the links that he will see they have with one\\r\\nanother, links he will content himself with observing and subsequently with\\r\\ncontrolling by experiment. Also there is always something of the succeeding\\r\\nstate in the preceding state and the ancients did not ignore observation,\\r\\nand there is always something of the preceding state in the succeeding\\r\\nstate and we have still theological and metaphysical habits of mind,\\r\\ntheological and metaphysical \"residues,\" and perhaps it will be always\\r\\nthus; but for theology to decline before metaphysics and metaphysics before\\r\\nscience is progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver and above this, Comte in the last portion of his life--as if to prove\\r\\nhis doctrine of residues and to furnish an example--founded a sort of\\r\\nreligion, a pseudo-religion, the religion of humanity. Humanity must be\\r\\nworshipped in its slow ascent towards intellectual and moral perfection\\r\\n(and, in consequence, we should specially worship humanity to come; but\\r\\nComte might reply that humanity past and present is venerable because it\\r\\nbears in its womb the humanity of the future). The worship of this new\\r\\nreligion is the commemoration and veneration of the dead. These last\\r\\nconceptions, fruits of the sensibility and of the imagination of Auguste\\r\\nComte, have no relation with the basis of his doctrine.\\r\\n\\r\\nRENOUVIER.--After him, by a vigorous reaction, Renouvier restored\\r\\nthe philosophy of Kant, depriving it of its too symmetrical, too minutely\\r\\nsystematic, too scholastic character and bringing it nearer to facts; from\\r\\nhim was to come the doctrine already mentioned, \"pragmatism,\" which\\r\\nmeasures the truth of every idea by the moral consequence that it contains.\\r\\n\\r\\nTAINE.--Very different and attaching himself to the general ideas of\\r\\nComte, Hippolyte Taine believed only in what has been observed,\\r\\nexperimented, and demonstrated; but being also as familiar with Hegel as\\r\\nwith Comte, with Spencer as with Condillac, he never doubted that the need\\r\\nof going beyond and escaping from oneself was also a fact, a human fact\\r\\neternal among humanity, and of this fact he took account as of a fact\\r\\nobserved and proved, saying if man is on one side a \"fierce and lascivious\\r\\ngorilla,\" on the other side he is a mystic animal, and that in \"a double\\r\\nnature, mysterious hymen,\" as Hugo wrote, lay the explanation of all the\\r\\nbaseness in ideas and actions as well as all the sublimity in ideas and\\r\\nactions of humanity. Personally he was a Stoic and his practice was the\\r\\ncontinuous development of the intelligence regarded as the condition and\\r\\nguarantee of morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nRENAN.--Renan, destined for the ecclesiastical profession and always\\r\\npreserving profound traces of his clerical education, was, nevertheless, a\\r\\nPositivist and believed only in science, hoping everything from it in youth\\r\\nand continuing to venerate it at least during his mature years. Thus\\r\\nformed, a \"Christian Positivist,\" as has been said, as well as a poet above\\r\\nall else, he could not proscribe metaphysics and had a weakness for them\\r\\nwith which perhaps he reproached himself. He extricated himself from this\\r\\ndifficulty by declaring all metaphysical conceptions to be only \"dreams,\"\\r\\nbut sheltered, so to say, by this concession he had made and this\\r\\nprecaution he had taken, he threw himself into the dream with all his heart\\r\\nand reconstituted God, the immortal soul, the future existence, eternity\\r\\nand creation, giving them new, unforeseen, and fascinating names. It was\\r\\nonly the idea of Providence--that is, of the particular and circumstantial\\r\\nintervention of God in human affairs, which was intolerable to him and\\r\\nagainst which he always protested, quoting the phrase of Malebranche, \"God\\r\\ndoes not act by particular wills.\" And yet he paid a compliment, which\\r\\nseems sincere, to the idea of grace, and if there be a particular and\\r\\ncircumstantial intervention by God in human affairs, it is certainly grace\\r\\naccording to all appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was above all an amateur of ideas, a dilettante in ideas, toying with\\r\\nthem with infinite pleasure, like a superior Greek sophist, and in all\\r\\nFrench philosophy no one calls Plato to mind more than he does.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe possessed a charming mind, a very lofty character, and was a marvellous\\r\\nwriter.\\r\\n\\r\\nTO-DAY.--The living French philosophers whom we shall content\\r\\nourselves with naming because they are living and receive contemporary\\r\\ncriticism rather than that of history, are MM. Fouill\\xc3\\xa9e, Th\\xc3\\xa9odule Ribot,\\r\\nLiard, Durckheim, Izoulet, and Bergson.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FUTURE OF PHILOSOPHY.--It is impossible to forecast in what\\r\\ndirection philosophy will move. The summary history we have been able to\\r\\ntrace sufficiently shows, as it seems to us, that it has no regular advance\\r\\nsuch that by seeing how it has progressed one can conjecture what path it\\r\\nwill pursue. It seems in no sense to depend, or at all events, to depend\\r\\nremarkably little, at any period, on the general state of civilization\\r\\naround it, and even for those who believe in a philosophy of history there\\r\\nis not, as it appears to me, a philosophy of the history of philosophy. The\\r\\nonly thing that can be affirmed is that philosophy will always exist in\\r\\nresponse to a need of the human mind, and that it will always be both an\\r\\neffort to gather scientific discoveries into some great general ideas and\\r\\nan effort to go beyond science and to seek as it can the meaning of the\\r\\nuniversal enigma; so that neither philosophy, properly speaking, nor even\\r\\nmetaphysics will ever disappear.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\\r\\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.

If philosophy is, as\\r\\nis commonly assumed, appropriate to a phase in the development of every\\r\\nindividual, it should _grow out_ of interests to which he is already\\r\\nalive. And if the great philosophers are indeed never dead, this fact\\r\\nshould manifest itself in their classic or historical representation of\\r\\na perennial outlook upon the world. I am not seeking to attach to\\r\\nphilosophy a fictitious liveliness, wherewith to insinuate it into the\\r\\ngood graces of the student. I hope rather to be true to the meaning of\\r\\nphilosophy. For there is that in its stand-point and its problem which\\r\\nmakes it universally significant entirely apart from dialectic and\\r\\nerudition. These are derived interests, indispensable to the scholar,\\r\\nbut quite separable from that modicum of philosophy which helps to make\\r\\nthe man. The present book is written for the sake of elucidating the\\r\\ninevitable philosophy. It seeks to make the reader more solicitously\\r\\naware of the philosophy that is in him, or to provoke him to philosophy\\r\\nin his own interests. To this end I have sacrificed all else to the task\\r\\nof mediating between the tradition and technicalities of the academic\\r\\ndiscipline and the more common terms of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe purpose of the book will in part account for those shortcomings that\\r\\nimmediately reveal themselves to the eye of the scholar. In Part I\\r\\nvarious great human interests have been selected as points of departure.\\r\\nI have sought to introduce the general stand-point and problem of\\r\\nphilosophy through its implication in practical life, poetry, religion,\\r\\nand science. But in so doing it has been necessary for me to deal\\r\\nshortly with topics of great independent importance, and so risk the\\r\\ndisfavor of those better skilled in these several matters. This is\\r\\nevidently true of the chapter which deals with natural science. But the\\r\\nproblem which I there faced differed radically from those of the\\r\\nforegoing chapters, and the method of treatment is correspondingly\\r\\ndifferent. In the case of natural science one has to deal with a body of\\r\\nknowledge which is frequently regarded as the only knowledge. To write a\\r\\nchapter about science from a philosophical stand-point is, in the\\r\\npresent state of opinion, to undertake a polemic against exclusive\\r\\nnaturalism, an attitude which is itself philosophical, and as such is\\r\\nwell known in the history of philosophy as _positivism_ or\\r\\n_agnosticism_. I have avoided the polemical spirit and method so far as\\r\\npossible, but have, nevertheless, here taken sides against a definite\\r\\nphilosophical position. This chapter, together with the Conclusion, is\\r\\ntherefore an exception to the purely introductory and expository\\r\\nrepresentation which I have, on the whole, sought to give. The\\r\\nrelatively great space accorded to the discussion of religion is, in my\\r\\nown belief, fair to the general interest in this topic, and to the\\r\\nintrinsic significance of its relation to philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have in Part II undertaken to furnish the reader with a map of the\\r\\ncountry to which he has been led. To this end I have attempted a brief\\r\\nsurvey of the entire programme of philosophy. An accurate and full\\r\\naccount of philosophical terms can be found in such books as K\\xc3\\xbclpe\\'s\\r\\n\"Introduction to Philosophy\" and Baldwin\\'s \"Dictionary of Philosophy,\"\\r\\nand an attempt to emulate their thoroughness would be superfluous, even\\r\\nif it were conformable to the general spirit of this book. The scope of\\r\\nPart II is due in part to a desire for brevity, but chiefly to the hope\\r\\nof furnishing an epitome that shall follow the course of the _natural\\r\\nand historical differentiation_ of the general philosophical problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I have in Part III sought to present the tradition of\\r\\nphilosophy in the form of general types. My purpose in undertaking so\\r\\ndifficult a task is to acquaint the reader with philosophy in the\\r\\nconcrete; to show how certain underlying principles may determine the\\r\\nwhole circle of philosophical ideas, and give them unity and distinctive\\r\\nflavor. Part II offers a general classification of philosophical\\r\\nproblems and conceptions independently of any special point of view. But\\r\\nI have in Part III sought to emphasize the point of view, or the\\r\\ninternal consistency that makes a _system of philosophy_ out of certain\\r\\nanswers to the special problems of philosophy. In such a division into\\r\\ntypes, lines are of necessity drawn too sharply. There will be many\\r\\nhistorical philosophies that refuse to fit, and many possibilities\\r\\nunprovided for. I must leave it to the individual reader to overcome\\r\\nthis abstractness through his own reflection upon the intermediate and\\r\\nvariant stand-points.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the order is on the whole that of progressive complexity, I\\r\\nhave sought to treat each chapter with independence enough to make it\\r\\npossible for it to be read separately; and I have provided a carefully\\r\\nselected bibliography in the hope that this book may serve as a stimulus\\r\\nand guide to the reading of other books.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earlier chapters have already appeared as articles: Chapter I in the\\r\\n_International Journal of Ethics_, Vol. XIII, No. 4; Chapter II in the\\r\\n_Philosophical Review_, Vol. XI, No. 6; Chapter III in the _Monist_,\\r\\nVol. XIV, No. 5; Chapter IV in the _International Journal of Ethics_,\\r\\nVol. XV, No. 1; and some paragraphs of Chapter V in the _Journal of\\r\\nPhilosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods_, Vol. I, No. 7. I am\\r\\nindebted to the editors of these periodicals for permission to reprint\\r\\nwith minor changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the writing of this, my first book, I have been often reminded that\\r\\na higher critic, skilled in the study of internal evidence, could\\r\\nprobably trace all of its ideas to suggestions that have come to me from\\r\\nmy teachers and colleagues of the Department of Philosophy in Harvard\\r\\nUniversity. I have unscrupulously forgotten what of their definite ideas\\r\\nI have adapted to my own use, but not that I received from them the\\r\\nmajor portion of my original philosophical capital. I am especially\\r\\nindebted to Professor William James for the inspiration and resources\\r\\nwhich I have received from his instruction and personal friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\n                                              RALPH BARTON PERRY.\\r\\n\\r\\nCAMBRIDGE, March, 1905.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[vii:A] Edw.

Philosophy suffers the distinction of being regarded as essentially\\r\\nan academic pursuit. The term _philosophy_, to be sure, is used in\\r\\ncommon speech to denote a stoical manner of accepting the vicissitudes\\r\\nof life; but this conception sheds little or no light upon the meaning\\r\\nof philosophy as a branch of scholarship. The men who write the books on\\r\\n\"Epistemology\" or \"Ontology,\" are regarded by the average man of\\r\\naffairs, even though he may have enjoyed a \"higher education,\" with\\r\\nlittle sympathy and less intelligence. Not even philology seems less\\r\\nconcerned with the real business of life. The pursuit of philosophy\\r\\nappears to be a phenomenon of extreme and somewhat effete culture, with\\r\\nits own peculiar traditions, problems, and aims, and with little or\\r\\nnothing to contribute to the real enterprises of society. It is easy to\\r\\nprove to the satisfaction of the philosopher that such a view is\\r\\nradically mistaken. But it is another and more serious matter to bridge\\r\\nover the very real gap that separates philosophy and common-sense. Such\\r\\nan aim is realized only when philosophy is seen to issue from some\\r\\nspecial interest that is humanly important; or when, after starting in\\r\\nthought at a point where one deals with ideas and interests common to\\r\\nall, one is led by the inevitableness of consistent thinking into the\\r\\nsphere of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Life as a Starting-point for Thought.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 2. There is but one starting-point for reflection when all men are\\r\\ninvited to share in it. Though there be a great many special platforms\\r\\nwhere special groups of men may take their stand together, there is only\\r\\none platform broad enough for all. This universal stand-point, or common\\r\\nplatform, is _life_. It is our more definite thesis, then, that\\r\\nphilosophy, even to its most abstruse technicality, is rooted in life;\\r\\nand that it is inseparably bound up with the satisfaction of practical\\r\\nneeds, and the solution of practical problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man knows what it is to live, and his immediate experience will\\r\\nverify those features of the adventure that stand out conspicuously. To\\r\\nbegin with, life is our birthright. We did not ask for it, but when we\\r\\ngrew old enough to be self-conscious we found ourselves in possession\\r\\nof it. Nor is it a gift to be neglected, even if we had the will. As is\\r\\ntrue of no other gift of nature, we must use it, or cease to be. There\\r\\nis a unique urgency about life. But we have already implied more, in so\\r\\nfar as we have said that it must be _used_, and have thereby referred to\\r\\nsome form of movement or activity as its inseparable attribute. To\\r\\nlive is to find one\\'s self compelled to do something. To do\\r\\n_something_--there is another implication of life: some outer\\r\\nexpression, some medium in which to register the degree and form of its\\r\\nactivity. Such we recognize as the environment of life, the real objects\\r\\namong which it is placed; which it may change, or from which it may\\r\\nsuffer change. Not only do we find our lives as unsolicited active\\r\\npowers, but find, as well, an arena prescribed for their exercise. That\\r\\nwe shall act, and in a certain time and place, and with reference to\\r\\ncertain other realities, this is the general condition of things that is\\r\\nencountered when each one of us discovers life. In short, to live means\\r\\nto be compelled to do something under certain circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another very common aspect of life that would not at first\\r\\nglance seem worthy of mention. Not only does life, as we have just\\r\\ndescribed it, mean opportunity, but it means self-conscious opportunity.\\r\\nThe facts are such as we have found them to be, and as each one of us\\r\\nhas previously found them for himself. But when we discover life for\\r\\nourselves, we who make the discovery, and we who live, are identical.\\r\\nFrom that moment we both live, and know that we live. Moreover, such is\\r\\nthe essential unity of our natures that our living must now express our\\r\\nknowing, and our knowing guide and illuminate our living. Consider the\\r\\nallegory of the centipede. From the beginning of time he had manipulated\\r\\nhis countless legs with exquisite precision. Men had regarded him with\\r\\nwonder and amazement. But he was innocent of his own art, being a\\r\\ncontrivance of nature, perfectly constructed to do her bidding. One day\\r\\nthe centipede discovered life. He discovered himself as one who walks,\\r\\nand the newly awakened intelligence, first observing, then foreseeing,\\r\\nat length began to direct the process. And from that moment the\\r\\ncentipede, because he could not remember the proper order of his going,\\r\\nlost all his former skill, and became the poor clumsy victim of his own\\r\\nself-consciousness. This same self-consciousness is the inconvenience\\r\\nand the great glory of human life. We must stumble along as best we\\r\\ncan, guided by the feeble light of our own little intelligence. If\\r\\nnature starts us on our way, she soon hands over the torch, and bids us\\r\\nfind the trail for ourselves. Most men are brave enough to regard this\\r\\nas the best thing of all; some despair on account of it. In either case\\r\\nit is admittedly the true story of human life. We must live as separate\\r\\nselves, observing, foreseeing, and planning. There are two things that\\r\\nwe can do about it. We can repudiate our natures, decline the\\r\\nresponsibility, and degenerate to the level of those animals that never\\r\\nhad our chance; or we can leap joyously to the helm, and with all the\\r\\nstrength and wisdom in us guide our lives to their destination. But if\\r\\nwe do the former, we shall be unable to forget what might have been, and\\r\\nshall be haunted by a sense of ignominy; and if we do the second, we\\r\\nshall experience the unique happiness of fulfilment and\\r\\nself-realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife, then, is a situation that appeals to intelligent activity. Humanly\\r\\nspeaking, there is no such thing as a situation that is not at the same\\r\\ntime a theory. As we live we are all theorists. Whoever has any\\r\\nmisgivings as to the practical value of theory, let him remember that,\\r\\nspeaking generally of human life, it is true to say that there is no\\r\\npractice that does not issue at length from reflection. That which is\\r\\nthe commonest experience of mankind is the conjunction of these two, the\\r\\nthought and the deed. And as surely as we are all practical theorists,\\r\\nso surely is philosophy the outcome of the broadening and deepening of\\r\\npractical theory. But to understand how the practical man becomes the\\r\\nphilosopher, we must inquire somewhat more carefully into the manner of\\r\\nhis thought about life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Practical Knowledge of Means.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 3. Let anyone inspect the last moment in his life, and in all\\r\\nprobability he will find that his mind was employed to discover the\\r\\nmeans to some end. He was already bent upon some definite achievement,\\r\\nand was thoughtful for the sake of selecting the economical and\\r\\neffectual way. His theory made his practice skilful. So through life his\\r\\nknowledge shows him how to work his will. Example, experience, and books\\r\\nhave taught him the uses of nature and society, and in his thoughtful\\r\\nliving he is enabled to reach the goal he has set for the next hour,\\r\\nday, or year of his activity. The long periods of human life are spent\\r\\nin elaborating the means to some unquestioned end. Here one meets the\\r\\ncurious truth that we wake up in the middle of life, already making\\r\\nheadway, and under the guidance of some invisible steersman. When first\\r\\nwe take the business of life seriously, there is a considerable stock in\\r\\ntrade in the shape of habits, and inclinations to all sorts of things\\r\\nthat we never consciously elected to pursue. Since we do not begin at\\r\\nthe beginning, our first problem is to accommodate ourselves to\\r\\nourselves, and our first deliberate acts are in fulfilment of plans\\r\\noutlined by some predecessor that has already spoken for us. The same\\r\\nthing is true of the race of men. At a certain stage in their\\r\\ndevelopment men found themselves engaged in all manner of ritual and\\r\\ncustom, and burdened with concerns that were not of their own choosing.\\r\\nThey were burning incense, keeping festivals, and naming names, all of\\r\\nwhich they must now proceed to justify with myth and legend, in order to\\r\\nrender intelligible to themselves the deliberate and self-conscious\\r\\nrepetition of them. Even so much justification was left to the few, and\\r\\nthe great majority continued to seek that good which social usage\\r\\ncountenanced and individual predisposition confirmed. So every man of us\\r\\nacts from day to day for love\\'s sake, or wealth\\'s sake, or power\\'s\\r\\nsake, or for the sake of some near and tangible object; reflecting only\\r\\nfor the greater efficiency of his endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Practical Knowledge of the End or Purpose.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 4. But if this be the common manner of thinking about life, it does\\r\\nnot represent the whole of such thought. Nor does it follow that because\\r\\nit occupies us so much, it is therefore correspondingly fundamental.\\r\\nLike the myth makers of old, we all want more or less to know the\\r\\n_reason of our ends_. Here, then, we meet with a somewhat different type\\r\\nof reflection upon life, the reflection that underlies the adoption of a\\r\\nlife purpose. It is obvious that most ends are selected for the sake of\\r\\nother ends, and so are virtually means. Thus one may struggle for years\\r\\nto secure a college education. This definite end has been adopted for\\r\\nthe sake of a somewhat more indefinite end of self-advancement, and from\\r\\nit there issues a whole series of minor ends, which form a hierarchy of\\r\\nsteps ascending to the highest goal of aspiration. Now upon the face of\\r\\nthings we live very unsystematic lives, and yet were we to examine\\r\\nourselves in this fashion, we should all find our lives to be marvels of\\r\\norganization. Their growth, as we have seen, began before we were\\r\\nconscious of it; and we are commonly so absorbed in some particular\\r\\nflower or fruit that we forget the roots, and the design of the whole.\\r\\nBut a little reflection reveals a remarkable unitary adjustment of\\r\\nparts. The unity is due to the dominance of a group of central purposes.\\r\\nJudged from the stand-point of experience, it seems bitter irony to say\\r\\nthat everyone gets from life just what he wishes. But a candid searching\\r\\nof our own hearts will incline us to admit that, after all, the way we\\r\\ngo and the length we go is determined pretty much by the kind and the\\r\\nintensity of our secret longing. That for which in the time of choice we\\r\\nare willing to sacrifice all else, is the formula that defines the law\\r\\nof each individual life. All this is not intended to mean that we have\\r\\neach named a clear and definite ideal which is our chosen goal. On the\\r\\ncontrary, such a conception may be almost meaningless to some of us. In\\r\\ngeneral the higher the ideal the vaguer and less vivid is its\\r\\npresentation to our consciousness. But, named or unnamed, sharp or\\r\\nblurred, vivid or half-forgotten, there may be found in the heart of\\r\\nevery man that which of all things he wants to be, that which of all\\r\\ndeeds he wants to do. If he has had the normal youth of dreaming, he\\r\\nhas seen it, and warmed to the picture of his imagination; if he has\\r\\nbeen somewhat more thoughtful than the ordinary, his reason has defined\\r\\nit, and adopted it for his vocation; if neither, it has been present as\\r\\nan undertone throughout the rendering of his more inevitable life. He\\r\\nwill recognize it when it is named as the desire to do the will of God,\\r\\nor to have as good a time as possible, or to make other people as happy\\r\\nas possible, or to be equal to his responsibilities, or to fulfil the\\r\\nexpectation of his mother, or to be distinguished, wealthy, or\\r\\ninfluential. This list of ideals is miscellaneous, and ethically\\r\\nreducible to more fundamental concepts, but these are the terms in which\\r\\nmen are ordinarily conscious of their most intimate purposes. We must\\r\\nnow inquire respecting the nature of the thought that determines the\\r\\nselection of such a purpose, or justifies it when it has been\\r\\nunconsciously accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Philosophy of the Devotee, the Man of Affairs, and the\\r\\nVoluptuary.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 5. What is most worth while? So far as human action is concerned this\\r\\nobviously depends upon what is possible, upon what is expected of us by\\r\\nour own natures, and upon what interests and concerns are conserved by\\r\\nthe trend of events in our environment. What I had best do, presupposes\\r\\nwhat I have the strength and the skill to do, what I feel called upon to\\r\\ndo, and what are the great causes that are entitled to promotion at my\\r\\nhands. It seems that practically we cannot separate the ideal from the\\r\\nreal. We may feel that the highest ideal is an immediate utterance of\\r\\nconscience, as mysterious in origin as it is authoritative in\\r\\nexpression. We may be willing to defy the universe, and expatriate\\r\\nourselves from our natural and social environment, for the sake of the\\r\\nholy law of duty. Such men as Count Tolstoi have little to say of the\\r\\npossible, or the expedient, or the actual, and are satisfied to stand\\r\\nalmost alone against the brutal facts of usage and economy. We all have\\r\\na secret sense of chivalry, that prompts, however ineffectually, to a\\r\\nlike devotion. But that which in such moral purposes appears to indicate\\r\\na severance of the ideal and the real, is, if we will but stop to\\r\\nconsider, only a severance of the ideal and the apparent. The martyr is\\r\\nmore sure of reality than the adventurer. He is convinced that though\\r\\nhis contemporaries and his environment be against him; the fundamental\\r\\nor eventual order of things is for him. He believes in a spiritual world\\r\\nmore abiding, albeit less obvious, than the material world. Though\\r\\nevery temporal event contradict him, he lives in the certainty that\\r\\neternity is his. Such an one may have found his ideal in the voice of\\r\\nGod and His prophets, or he may have been led to God as the\\r\\njustification of his irresistible ideal; but in either case the\\r\\nselection of his ideal is reasonable to him in so far as it is\\r\\nharmonious with the ultimate nature of things, or stands for the promise\\r\\nof reality. In this wise, thought about life expands into some\\r\\nconception of the deeper forces of the world, and life itself, in\\r\\nrespect of its fundamental attachment to an ideal, implies some belief\\r\\nconcerning the fundamental nature of its environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut lest in this account life be credited with too much gravity and\\r\\nimport, or it seem to be assumed that life is all knight-errantry, let\\r\\nus turn to our less quixotic, and perhaps more effectual, man of\\r\\naffairs. He works for his daily bread, and for success in his vocation.\\r\\nHe has selected his vocation for its promise of return in the form of\\r\\nwealth, comfort, fame, or influence. He likewise performs such\\r\\nadditional service to his family and his community as is demanded of him\\r\\nby public opinion and his own sense of responsibility. He may have a\\r\\ncertain contempt for the man who sees visions. This may be his manner of\\r\\ntestifying to his own preference for the ideal of usefulness and\\r\\nimmediate efficiency. But even so he would never for an instant admit\\r\\nthat he was pursuing a merely conventional good. He may be largely\\r\\nimitative in his standards of value, recognizing such aims as are common\\r\\nto some time or race; nevertheless none would be more sure than he of\\r\\nthe truth of his ideal. Question him, and he will maintain that his is\\r\\nthe reasonable life under the conditions of human existence. He may\\r\\nmaintain that if there be a God, he can best serve Him by promoting the\\r\\ntangible welfare of himself and those dependent upon him. He may\\r\\nmaintain that, since there is no God, he must win such rewards as the\\r\\nworld can give. If he have something of the heroic in him, he may tell\\r\\nyou that, since there is no God, he will labor to the uttermost for his\\r\\nfellow-men. Where he has not solved the problem of life for himself, he\\r\\nmay believe himself to be obeying the insight of some one wiser than\\r\\nhimself, or of society as expressed in its customs and institutions. But\\r\\nno man ever admitted that his life was purely a matter of expediency, or\\r\\nthat in his dominant ideal he was the victim of chance. In the\\r\\nbackground of the busiest and most preoccupied life of affairs, there\\r\\ndwells the conviction that such living is appropriate to the universe;\\r\\nthat it is called for by the circumstances of its origin, opportunities,\\r\\nand destiny.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the man who makes light of life has of all men the most\\r\\ntransparent inner consciousness. In him may be clearly observed the\\r\\nrelation between the ideal and the reflection that is assumed to justify\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"A Moment\\'s Halt--a momentary taste\\r\\n      Of Being from the Well amid the Waste--\\r\\n      And Lo!--the phantom Caravan has reach\\'d\\r\\n      The Nothing it set out from-- . . .\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We are no other than a moving row\\r\\n      Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go\\r\\n      Round with the Sun-illumin\\'d Lantern held\\r\\n      In Midnight by the Master of the Show.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere the setting of life is construed in these terms, there is but one\\r\\nnatural and appropriate manner of life. Once believing in the isolation\\r\\nand insignificance of life, one is sceptical of all worth save such as\\r\\nmay be tasted in the moment of its purchase. If one\\'s ideas and\\r\\nexperiences are no concern of the world\\'s, but incidents of a purely\\r\\nlocal and transient interest, they will realize most when they realize\\r\\nan immediate gratification. Where one does not believe that he is a\\r\\nmember of the universe, and a contributor to its ends, he does well to\\r\\nminimize the friction that arises from its accidental propinquity, and\\r\\nto kindle some little fire of enjoyment in his own lonely heart. This is\\r\\nthe life of abandonment to pleasure, accompanied by the conviction that\\r\\nthe conditions of life warrant no more strenuous or heroic plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Adoption of Purposes and the Philosophy of Life.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 6. In such wise do we adopt the life purpose, or justify it when\\r\\nunconsciously adopted. The pursuit of an ideal implies a belief in its\\r\\neffectuality. Such a belief will invariably appear when the groundwork\\r\\nof the daily living is laid bare by a little reflection. And if our\\r\\nanalysis has not been in error, there is something more definite to be\\r\\nobtained from it. We all believe in the practical wisdom of our\\r\\nfundamental ideals; but we believe, besides, that such wisdom involves\\r\\nthe sanction of the universe as a whole. The momentousness of an\\r\\nindividual\\'s life will be satisfied with nothing less final than an\\r\\nabsolutely wise disposition of it. For every individual, his life is all\\r\\nhis power and riches, and is not to be spent save for the _greatest good\\r\\nthat he can reasonably pursue_. But the solution of such a problem is\\r\\nnot to be obtained short of a searching of entire reality. Every life\\r\\nwill represent more or less of such wisdom and enlightenment; and in the\\r\\nend the best selection of ideal will denote the greatest wealth of\\r\\nexperience. It is not always true that he who has seen more will live\\r\\nmore wisely, for in an individual case instinct or authority may be\\r\\nbetter sources of aspiration than experience. But we trust instinct and\\r\\nauthority because we believe them to represent a comprehensive\\r\\nexperience on the part of the race as a whole, or on the part of God. He\\r\\nwhose knowledge is broadest and truest would know best what is finally\\r\\nworth living for. On this account, most men can see no more reasonable\\r\\nplan of life than obedience to God\\'s will, for God in the abundance of\\r\\nhis wisdom, and since all eternity is plain before him, must see with\\r\\ncertainty that which is supremely worthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe mean, then, that the selection of our ideals shall be determined by\\r\\nthe largest possible knowledge of the facts pertaining to life. We mean\\r\\nto select as one would select who knew all about the antecedents and\\r\\nsurroundings and remote consequences of life. In our own weakness and\\r\\nfinitude we may go but a little way in the direction of such an\\r\\ninsight, and may prefer to accept the judgment of tradition or\\r\\nauthority, but we recognize a distinct type of knowledge as alone worthy\\r\\nto justify an individual\\'s adoption of an ideal. That type of knowledge\\r\\nis the knowledge that comprehends the universe in its totality. Such\\r\\nknowledge does not involve completeness of information respecting all\\r\\nparts of reality. This, humanly speaking, is both unattainable and\\r\\ninconceivable. It involves rather a conception of the _kind_ of reality\\r\\nthat is fundamental. For a wise purpose it is unnecessary that we should\\r\\nknow many matters of fact, or even specific laws, provided we are\\r\\nconvinced of the inner and essential character of the universe. Some of\\r\\nthe alternatives are matters of every-day thought and speech. One cannot\\r\\ntell the simplest story of human life without disclosing them. To live\\r\\nthe human life means to pursue ideals, that is, to have a thing in mind,\\r\\nand then to try to accomplish it. Here is one kind of reality and power.\\r\\nThe planetary system, on the other hand, does not pursue ideals, but\\r\\nmoves unconscious of itself, with a mechanical precision that can be\\r\\nexpressed in a mathematical formula; and is representative of another\\r\\nkind of reality and power. Hence a very common and a very practical\\r\\nquestion: Is there an underlying law, like the law of gravitation,\\r\\nfundamentally and permanently governing life, in spite of its apparent\\r\\ndirection by ideal and aspiration? Or is there an underlying power, like\\r\\npurpose, fundamentally and permanently governing the planetary system\\r\\nand all celestial worlds, in spite of the apparent control of blind and\\r\\nirresistible forces? This is a practical question because nothing could\\r\\nbe more pertinent to our choice of ideals. Nothing could make more\\r\\ndifference to life than a belief in the life or lifelessness of its\\r\\nenvironment. The faiths that generate or confirm our ideals always refer\\r\\nto this great issue. And this is but one, albeit the most profound, of\\r\\nthe many issues that arise from the desire to obtain some conviction of\\r\\nthe inner and essential character of life. Though so intimately\\r\\nconnected with practical concerns, these issues are primarily the\\r\\nbusiness of thought. In grappling with them, thought is called upon for\\r\\nits greatest comprehensiveness, penetration, and self-consistency. By\\r\\nthe necessity of concentration, thought is sometimes led to forget its\\r\\norigin and the source of its problems. But in naming itself philosophy,\\r\\nthought has only recognized the definiteness and earnestness of its\\r\\nlargest task. Philosophy is still thought about life, representing but\\r\\nthe deepening and broadening of the common practical thoughtfulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe who began together at the starting-point of _life_, have now entered\\r\\ntogether the haven of _philosophy_. It is not a final haven, but only\\r\\nthe point of departure for the field of philosophy proper. Nevertheless\\r\\nthat field is now in the plain view of the man who occupies the\\r\\npractical stand-point. He must recognize in philosophy a kind of\\r\\nreflection that differs only in extent and persistence from the\\r\\nreflection that guides and justifies his life. He may not consciously\\r\\nidentify himself with any one of the three general groups which have\\r\\nbeen characterized. But if he is neither an idealist, nor a philistine,\\r\\nnor a pleasure lover, surely he is compounded of such elements, and does\\r\\nnot escape their implications. He desires something most of all, even\\r\\nthough his highest ideal be only an inference from the gradation of his\\r\\nimmediate purposes. This highest ideal represents what he conceives to\\r\\nbe the greatest worth or value attainable in the universe, and its\\r\\nadoption is based upon the largest generalization that he can make or\\r\\nborrow. The complete justification of his ideal would involve a true\\r\\nknowledge of the essential character of the universe. For such knowledge\\r\\nhe substitutes either authority or his own imperfect insight. But in\\r\\neither case his life is naturally and organically correlated with a\\r\\n_thought about the universe in its totality, or in its deepest and\\r\\nessential character_. Such thought, the activity and its results, is\\r\\nphilosophy. Hence he who lives is, _ipso facto_, a philosopher. He is\\r\\nnot only a potential philosopher, but a partial philosopher. He has\\r\\nalready begun to be a philosopher. Between the fitful or prudential\\r\\nthinking of some little man of affairs, and the sustained thought of the\\r\\ndevoted lover of truth, there is indeed a long journey, but it is a\\r\\nstraight journey along the same road. Philosophy is neither accidental\\r\\nnor supernatural, but inevitable and normal. Philosophy is not properly\\r\\na vocation, but the ground and inspiration of all vocations. In the\\r\\nhands of its devotees it grows technical and complex, as do all efforts\\r\\nof thought, and to pursue philosophy bravely and faithfully is to\\r\\nencounter obstacles and labyrinths innumerable. The general problem of\\r\\nphilosophy is mother of a whole brood of problems, little and great. But\\r\\nwhether we be numbered among its devotees, or their beneficiaries, an\\r\\nequal significance attaches to the truth that philosophy is continuous\\r\\nwith life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II\\r\\n\\r\\nPOETRY AND PHILOSOPHY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Who is the Philosopher-Poet?]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 7. As the ultimate criticism of all human interests, philosophy may be\\r\\napproached by avenues as various as these interests. Only when\\r\\nphilosophy is discovered as the implication of well-recognized special\\r\\ninterests, is the significance of its function fully appreciated. For\\r\\nthe sake of such a further understanding of philosophy, those who find\\r\\neither inspiration or entertainment in poetry are invited in the present\\r\\nchapter to consider certain of the relations between poetry and\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must at the very outset decline to accept unqualifiedly the poet\\'s\\r\\nopinion in the matter, for he would not think it presumptuous to\\r\\nincorporate philosophy in poetry. \"No man,\" said Coleridge, \"was ever\\r\\nyet a great poet without being at the same time a great philosopher.\"\\r\\nThis would seem to mean that a great poet is a great philosopher, and\\r\\nmore too. We shall do better to begin with the prosaic and matter of\\r\\nfact minimum of truth: some poetry is philosophical. This will enable\\r\\nus to search for the portion of philosophy that is in some poetry,\\r\\nwithout finally defining their respective boundaries. It may be that all\\r\\ntrue poetry is philosophical, as it may be that all true philosophy is\\r\\npoetical; but it is much more certain that much actual poetry is far\\r\\nfrom philosophical, and that most actual philosophy was not conceived or\\r\\nwritten by a poet. The mere poet and the mere philosopher must be\\r\\ntolerated, if it be only for the purpose of shedding light upon the\\r\\nphilosopher-poet and the poet-philosopher. And it is to the\\r\\nphilosopher-poet that we turn, in the hope that under the genial spell\\r\\nof poetry we may be brought with understanding to the more forbidding\\r\\nland of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Poetry as Appreciation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 8. Poetry is well characterized, though not defined, as an\\r\\ninterpretation of life. The term \"life\" here signifies the human\\r\\npurposive consciousness, and active pursuit of ends. An interpretation\\r\\nof life is, then, a selection and account of such values in human\\r\\nexperience as are actually sought or are worth the seeking. For the poet\\r\\nall things are good or bad, and never only matters of fact. He is\\r\\nneither an annalist nor a statistician, and is even an observer only\\r\\nfor the sake of a higher design. He is one who appreciates, and\\r\\nexpresses his appreciation so fittingly that it becomes a kind of truth,\\r\\nand a permanently communicable object. That \"unbodied joy,\" the\\r\\nskylark\\'s song and flight, is through the genius of Shelley so\\r\\nfaithfully embodied, that it may enter as a definite joy into the lives\\r\\nof countless human beings. The sensuous or suggestive values of nature\\r\\nare caught by the poet\\'s quick feeling for beauty, and fixed by his\\r\\ncreative activity. Or with his ready sympathy he may perceive the value\\r\\nof some human ideal or mastering passion, and make it a reality for our\\r\\ncommon feeling. Where the poet has to do with the base and hateful, his\\r\\nattitude is still appreciative. The evil is apprehended as part of a\\r\\ndramatic whole having positive moral or \\xc3\\xa6sthetic value. Moral ideas may\\r\\nappear in both poetry and life as the inspiration and justification of\\r\\nstruggle. Where there is no conception of its moral significance, the\\r\\nrepulsive possesses for the poet\\'s consciousness the \\xc3\\xa6sthetic value of\\r\\ndiversity and contrast. Even where the evil and ugly is isolated, as in\\r\\ncertain of Browning\\'s dramatic monologues, it forms, both for the poet\\r\\nand the reader, but a part of some larger perception of life or\\r\\ncharacter, which is sublime or beautiful or good. Poetry involves,\\r\\nthen, the discovery and presentation of human experiences that are\\r\\nsatisfying and appealing. It is a language for human pleasures and\\r\\nideals. Poetry is without doubt a great deal more than this, and only\\r\\nafter a careful analysis of its peculiar language could one distinguish\\r\\nit from kindred arts; but it will suffice for our purposes to\\r\\ncharacterize and not differentiate. Starting from this most general\\r\\ntruth respecting poetry, we may now look for that aspect of it whereby\\r\\nit may be a witness of philosophical truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Sincerity in Poetry. Whitman.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 9. For the answer to our question, we must turn to an examination of\\r\\nthe intellectual elements of poetry. In the first place, the common\\r\\ndemand that the poet shall be accurate in his representations is\\r\\nsuggestive of an indispensable intellectual factor in his genius. As we\\r\\nhave seen, he is not to reproduce nature, but the human appreciative\\r\\nexperience of nature. Nevertheless, he must even here be true to his\\r\\nobject. His art involves his ability to express genuinely and sincerely\\r\\nwhat he himself experiences in the presence of nature, or what he can\\r\\ncatch of the inner lives of others by virtue of his intelligent\\r\\nsympathy. No amount of emotion or even of imagination will profit a\\r\\npoet, unless he can render a true account of them. To be sure, he need\\r\\nnot define, or even explain; for it is his function to transfer the\\r\\nimmediate qualities of experience: but he must be able to speak the\\r\\ntruth, and, in order to speak it, he must have known it. In all this,\\r\\nhowever, we have made no demand that the poet should see more than one\\r\\nthing at a time. Sincerity of expression does not require what is\\r\\ndistinctly another mode of intelligence, _comprehensiveness of view_. It\\r\\nis easier, and accordingly more usual, to render an account of the\\r\\nmoments and casual units of experience, than of its totality. There are\\r\\npoets, little and great, who possess the intellectual virtue of\\r\\nsincerity, without the intellectual power of synthesis and\\r\\nreconciliation. This distinction will enable us to separate the\\r\\nintelligence exhibited in all poetry, from that distinct form of\\r\\nintelligence exhibited in such poetry as is properly to be called\\r\\nphilosophical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"barbarian\" in poetry has recently been defined as \"the man who\\r\\nregards his passions as their own excuse for being; who does not\\r\\ndomesticate them either by understanding their cause or by conceiving\\r\\ntheir ideal goal.\"[28:1] One will readily appreciate the application of\\r\\nthis definition to Walt Whitman. What little unity there is in this\\r\\npoet\\'s world, is the composition of a purely sensuous experience,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The earth expending right hand and left hand,\\r\\n      The picture alive, every part in its best light,\\r\\n      The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where\\r\\n          it is not wanted.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many passages Whitman manifests a marvellous ability to discover and\\r\\ncommunicate a fresh gladness about the commonest experiences. We cannot\\r\\nbut rejoice with him in all sights and sounds. But though we cannot deny\\r\\nhim truth, his truth is honesty and not understanding. The experiences\\r\\nin which he discovers so much worth, are random and capricious, and do\\r\\nnot constitute a universe. To the solution of ultimate questions he\\r\\ncontributes a sense of mystery, and the conviction\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"That you are here--that life exists and identity,\\r\\n      That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHis world is justly described by the writer just quoted as \"a\\r\\nphantasmagoria of continuous visions, vivid, impressive, but monotonous\\r\\nand hard to distinguish in memory, like the waves of the sea or the\\r\\ndecorations of some barbarous temple, sublime only by the infinite\\r\\naggregation of parts.\"[30:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is Walt Whitman, so are many poets greater and less. Some who have\\r\\nseen the world-view, exhibit the same particularism in their lyric\\r\\nmoods; although, generally speaking, a poet who once has comprehended\\r\\nthe world, will see the parts of it in the light of that wisdom. But\\r\\nWalt Whitman is peculiarly representative of the poetry that can be\\r\\ntrue, without being wise in the manner that we shall come shortly to\\r\\nunderstand as the manner of philosophy. He is as desultory in his poet\\r\\nraptures as is the common man when he lives in his immediate\\r\\nexperiences. The truth won by each is the clear vision of one thing, or\\r\\nof a limited collection of things, and not the broad inclusive vision of\\r\\nall things.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Constructive Knowledge in Poetry. Shakespeare.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 10. The transition from Whitman to Shakespeare may seem somewhat\\r\\nabrupt, but the very differences between these poets serve to mark out\\r\\nan interesting affinity. Neither has put any unitary construction upon\\r\\nhuman life and its environment. Neither, as poet, is the witness of any\\r\\nworld-view; which will mean for us that neither is a philosopher-poet.\\r\\nAs respects Shakespeare, this is a hard saying. We are accustomed to the\\r\\ncritical judgment that finds in the Shakespearian dramas an apprehension\\r\\nof the universal in human life. But though this judgment is true, it is\\r\\nby no means conclusive as respects Shakespeare\\'s relation to the\\r\\nphilosophical type of thought. For there can be universality without\\r\\nphilosophy. Thus, to know the groups and the marks of the vertebrates is\\r\\nto know a truth which possesses generality, in contradistinction to the\\r\\nparticularism of Whitman\\'s poetic consciousness. Even so to know well\\r\\nthe groups and marks of human character, vertebrate and invertebrate, is\\r\\nto know that of which the average man, in his hand to hand struggle with\\r\\nlife, is ignorant. Such a wisdom Shakespeare possessed to a unique\\r\\ndegree, and it enabled him to reconstruct human life. He did not merely\\r\\nperceive human states and motives, but he understood human nature so\\r\\nwell that he could create consistent men and women. Moreover,\\r\\nShakespeare\\'s knowledge was not only thus universal in being a knowledge\\r\\nof general groups and laws, but also in respect of its extensity. His\\r\\nunderstanding was as rich as it was acute. It is true, then, that\\r\\nShakespeare read human life as an open book, knowing certainly the\\r\\nmanner of human thinking and feeling, and the power and interplay of\\r\\nhuman motives. But it is equally true, on the other hand, that he\\r\\npossessed no unitary conception of the meaning and larger relations of\\r\\nhuman life. Such a conception might have been expressed either by means\\r\\nof the outlook of some dominating and persistent type of personality, or\\r\\nby a pervading suggestion of some constant world-setting for the\\r\\nvariable enterprise of mankind. It could appear only provided the poet\\'s\\r\\nappreciation of life in detail were determined by an interpretation of\\r\\nthe meaning of life as a whole. Shakespeare apparently possessed no such\\r\\ninterpretation. Even when Hamlet is groping after some larger truth that\\r\\nmay bear upon the definite problems of life, he represents but one, and\\r\\nthat a strange and unusual, type of human nature. And Hamlet\\'s\\r\\nreflections, it should be noted, have no outcome. There is no\\r\\nShakespearian answer to the riddles that Hamlet propounds. The poet\\'s\\r\\ngenius is not less amazing for this fact; indeed, his peculiar\\r\\ndistinction can only be comprehended upon this basis. Shakespeare put no\\r\\nconstruction upon life, and by virtue of this very reserve accomplished\\r\\nan art of surpassing fidelity and vividness. The absence of philosophy\\r\\nin Shakespeare, and the presence of the most characteristic quality of\\r\\nhis genius, may both be imputed by the one affirmation, that _there is\\r\\nno Shakespearian point of view_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis truth signifies both gain and loss. The philosophical criticism of\\r\\nlife may vary from the ideal objectivity of absolute truth, to the\\r\\nsubjectivity of a personal religion. Philosophy aims to correct the\\r\\npartiality of particular points of view by means of a point of view that\\r\\nshall comprehend their relations, and effect such reconciliations or\\r\\ntransformations as shall enable them to constitute a universe.\\r\\nPhilosophy always assumes the hypothetical view of omniscience. The\\r\\nnecessity of such a final criticism is implicit in every scientific item\\r\\nof knowledge, and in every judgment that is passed upon life. Philosophy\\r\\nmakes a distinct and peculiar contribution to human knowledge by its\\r\\nheroic effort to measure all knowledges and all ideals by the standard\\r\\nof totality. Nevertheless it is significant that no human individual can\\r\\npossibly possess the range of omniscience. The most adequate knowledge\\r\\nof which any generation of men is capable, will always be that which is\\r\\nconceived by the most synthetic and vigorously metaphysical minds; but\\r\\nevery individual philosophy will nevertheless be a premature synthesis.\\r\\nThe effort to complete knowledge is the indispensable test of the\\r\\nadequacy of prevailing conceptions, but the completed knowledge of any\\r\\nindividual mind will shortly become an historical monument. It will\\r\\nbelong primarily to the personal life of its creator, as the\\r\\narticulation of his personal covenant with the universe. There is a\\r\\nsound justification for such a conclusion of things in the case of the\\r\\nindividual, for the conditions of human life make it inevitable; but it\\r\\nwill always possess a felt unity, and many distinct features, that are\\r\\nprivate and subjective. Now such a projection of personality, with its\\r\\ncoloring and its selection, Shakespeare has avoided; and very largely as\\r\\na consequence, his dramas are a storehouse of genuine human nature.\\r\\nAmbition, mercy, hate, madness, guilelessness, conventionality, mirth,\\r\\nbravery, deceit, purity--these, and all human states and attributes save\\r\\npiety, are upon his pages as real, and as mysterious withal, as they are\\r\\nin the great historical society. For an ordinary reader, these states\\r\\nand attributes are more real in Hamlet or Lear than in his own direct\\r\\nexperience, because in Hamlet and Lear he can see them with the eye and\\r\\nintelligence of genius. But Shakespeare is the world all over again,\\r\\nand there is loss as well as gain in such realism. Here is human life,\\r\\nno doubt, and a brilliant pageantry it is; but human life as varied and\\r\\nas problematic as it is in the living. Shakespeare\\'s fundamental\\r\\nintellectual resource is the historical and psychological knowledge of\\r\\nsuch principles as govern the construction of human natures. The goods\\r\\nfor which men undertake, and live or die, are any goods, justified only\\r\\nby the actual human striving for them. The virtues are the old winning\\r\\nvirtues of the secular life, and the heroisms of the common conscience.\\r\\nBeyond its empirical generality, his knowledge is universal only in the\\r\\nsense that space and time are universal. His consciousness _contains_\\r\\nits representative creations, and expresses them unspoiled by any\\r\\ntransforming thought. His poetic consciousness is like the very stage to\\r\\nwhich he likens all the world: men and women meet there, and things\\r\\nhappen there. The stage itself creates no unity save the occasion and\\r\\nthe place. Shakespeare\\'s consciousness is universal because it is a fair\\r\\nfield with no favors. But even so it is particular, because, though each\\r\\nmay enter and depart in peace, when all enter together there is anarchy\\r\\nand a babel of voices. All Shakespeare is like all the world seen\\r\\nthrough the eyes of each of its inhabitants. Human experience in\\r\\nShakespeare is human experience as everyone feels it, as comprehensive\\r\\nas the aggregate of innumerable lives. But human experience in\\r\\nphilosophy is the experience of all as thought by a synthetic mind.\\r\\nHence the wealth of life depicted by Shakespeare serves only to point\\r\\nout the philosopher\\'s problem, and to challenge his powers. Here he will\\r\\nfind material, and not results; much to philosophize about, but no\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Philosophy in Poetry. The World-View. Omar Khayyam.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 11. The discussion up to this point has attributed to poetry very\\r\\ndefinite intellectual factors that nevertheless do not constitute\\r\\nphilosophy. Walt Whitman speaks his feeling with truth, but in general\\r\\nmanifests no comprehensive insight. Shakespeare has not only sincerity\\r\\nof expression but an understanding mind. He has a knowledge not only of\\r\\nparticular experiences, but of human nature; and a consciousness full\\r\\nand varied like society itself. But there is a kind of knowledge\\r\\npossessed by neither, the knowledge sought by co\\xc3\\xb6rdinating all aspects\\r\\nof human experience, both particular and general. Not even Shakespeare\\r\\nis wise as one who, having seen the whole, can fundamentally interpret a\\r\\npart. But though the philosopher-poet may not yet be found, we cannot\\r\\nlonger be ignorant of his nature. He will be, like all poets, one who\\r\\nappreciates experiences or finds things good, and he will faithfully\\r\\nreproduce the values which he discovers. But he must _justify himself in\\r\\nview of the fundamental nature of the universe_. The values which he\\r\\napprehends must be harmonious, and so far above the plurality of goods\\r\\nas to transcend and unify them. The philosopher-poet will find reality\\r\\nas a whole to be something that accredits the order of values in his\\r\\ninner life. He will not only find certain things to be most worthy\\r\\nobjects of action or contemplation, but he will see why they are worthy,\\r\\nbecause he will have construed the judgment of the universe in their\\r\\nfavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this general sense, Omar Khayyam is a philosopher-poet. To be sure\\r\\nhis universe is quite the opposite of that which most poets conceive,\\r\\nand is perhaps profoundly antagonistic to the very spirit of poetry; but\\r\\nit is none the less true that the joys to which Omar invites us are such\\r\\nas his universe prescribes for human life.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Some for the Glories of This World; and some\\r\\n      Sigh for the Prophet\\'s Paradise to come;\\r\\n      Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,\\r\\n      Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHerein is both poetry and philosophy, albeit but a poor brand of each.\\r\\nWe are invited to occupy ourselves only with spiritual cash, because the\\r\\nuniverse is spiritually insolvent. The immediately gratifying feelings\\r\\nare the only feelings that the world can guarantee. Omar Khayyam is a\\r\\nphilosopher-poet, because his immediate delight in \"youth\\'s\\r\\nsweet-scented manuscript\" is part of a consciousness that vaguely sees,\\r\\nthough it cannot grasp, \"this sorry scheme of things entire.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Drink for you know not whence you come, nor why;\\r\\n      Drink for you know not why you go, nor where.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Wordsworth.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 12. But the poet in his world-view ordinarily sees other than\\r\\ndarkness. The same innate spiritual enterprise that sustains religious\\r\\nfaith leads the poet more often to find the universe positively\\r\\ncongenial to his ideals, and to ideals in general. He interprets human\\r\\nexperience in the light of the spirituality of all the world. It is to\\r\\nWordsworth that we of the present age are chiefly indebted for such\\r\\nimagery, and it will profit us to consider somewhat carefully the\\r\\nphilosophical quality of his poetry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalter Pater, in introducing his appreciation of Wordsworth, writes that\\r\\n\"an intimate consciousness of the expression of natural things, which\\r\\nweighs, listens, penetrates, where the earlier mind passed roughly by,\\r\\nis a large element in the complexion of modern poetry.\" We recognize at\\r\\nonce the truth of this characterization as applied to Wordsworth. But\\r\\nthere is something more distinguished about this poet\\'s sensibility even\\r\\nthan its extreme fineness and delicacy; a quality that is suggested,\\r\\nthough not made explicit, by Shelley\\'s allusion to Wordsworth\\'s\\r\\nexperience as \"a sort of thought in sense.\" Nature possessed for him not\\r\\nmerely enjoyable and describable characters of great variety and\\r\\nminuteness, but an immediately apprehended unity and meaning. It would\\r\\nbe a great mistake to construe this meaning in sense as analogous to the\\r\\ncrude symbolism of the educator Froebel, to whom, as he said, \"the world\\r\\nof crystals proclaimed, in distinct and univocal terms, the laws of\\r\\nhuman life.\" Wordsworth did not attach ideas to sense, but regarded\\r\\nsense itself as a communication of truth. We readily call to mind his\\r\\nunique capacity for apprehending the characteristic flavor of a certain\\r\\nplace in a certain moment of time, the individuality of a situation. Now\\r\\nin such moments he felt that he was receiving intelligences, none the\\r\\nless direct and significant for their inarticulate form. Like the boy\\r\\non Windermere, whom he himself describes,\\r\\n\\r\\n                          \"while he hung\\r\\n     Loitering, a gentle shock of mild surprise\\r\\n     Has carried far into his heart the voice\\r\\n     Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene\\r\\n     Would enter unawares into his mind,\\r\\n     With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,\\r\\n     Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received\\r\\n     Into the bosom of the steady lake.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor our purpose it is essential that we should recognize in this\\r\\nappreciation of nature, expressed in almost every poem that Wordsworth\\r\\nwrote, a consciousness respecting the fundamental nature of the world.\\r\\nConversation, as we know, denotes an interchange of commensurable\\r\\nmeanings. Whatever the code may be, whether words or the most subtle\\r\\nform of suggestion, communication is impossible without community of\\r\\nnature. Hence, in believing himself to be holding converse with the\\r\\nso-called physical world, Wordsworth conceives that world as\\r\\nfundamentally like himself. He finds the most profound thing in all the\\r\\nworld to be the universal spiritual life. In nature this life manifests\\r\\nitself most directly, clothed in its own proper dignity and peace. But\\r\\nit may be discovered in the humanity that is most close to nature, in\\r\\nthe avocations of plain and simple people, and the unsophisticated\\r\\ndelights of children; and, with the perspective of contemplation, even\\r\\n\"among the multitudes of that huge city.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Wordsworth is rendering a true account of his own experience of\\r\\nreality when, as in \"The Prelude,\" he says unequivocally:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"A gracious spirit o\\'er this earth presides,\\r\\n      And in the heart of man; invisibly\\r\\n      It comes to works of unreproved delight,\\r\\n      And tendency benign; directing those\\r\\n      Who care not, know not, think not, what they do.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWordsworth is not a philosopher-poet because by searching his pages we\\r\\ncan find an explicit philosophical creed such as this, but because all\\r\\nthe joys of which his poet-soul compels him to sing have their peculiar\\r\\nnote, and compose their peculiar harmony, by virtue of such an\\r\\nindwelling consciousness. Here is one who is a philosopher in and\\r\\nthrough his poetry. He is a philosopher in so far as the detail of his\\r\\nappreciation finds fundamental justification in a world-view. From the\\r\\nimmanence of \"the universal heart\" there follows, not through any\\r\\nmediate reasoning, but by the immediate experience of its propriety, a\\r\\nconception of that which is of supreme worth in life. The highest and\\r\\nbest of which life is capable is contemplation, or the consciousness of\\r\\nthe universal indwelling of God. Of those who fail to live thus\\r\\nfittingly in the midst of the divine life, Walter Pater speaks for\\r\\nWordsworth as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To higher or lower ends they move too often with something of\\r\\n     a sad countenance, with hurried and ignoble gait, becoming,\\r\\n     unconsciously, something like thorns, in their anxiety to bear\\r\\n     grapes; it being possible for people, in the pursuit of even\\r\\n     great ends, to become themselves thin and impoverished in\\r\\n     spirit and temper, thus diminishing the sum of perfection in\\r\\n     the world at its very sources.\"[42:3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quiet and worshipful spirit, won by the cultivation of the emotions\\r\\nappropriate to the presence of nature and society, is the mark of the\\r\\ncompletest life and the most acceptable service. Thus for Wordsworth the\\r\\nmeaning of life is inseparable from the meaning of the universe. In\\r\\napprehending that which is good and beautiful in human experience, he\\r\\nwas attended by a vision of the totality of things. Herein he has had to\\r\\ndo, if not with the form, at any rate with the very substance of\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Dante.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 13. Unquestionably the supreme philosopher-poet is Dante. He is not\\r\\nonly philosophical in the temper of his mind, but his greatest poem is\\r\\nthe incarnation of a definite system of philosophy, the most definite\\r\\nthat the world has seen. That conception of the world which in the\\r\\nthirteenth century found argumentative and orderly expression in the\\r\\n\"Summa Theologi\\xc3\\xa6\" of Thomas of Aquino, and constituted the faith of the\\r\\nchurch, is visualized by Dante, and made the basis of an interpretation\\r\\nof life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \"Divina Commedia\" deals with all the heavens to the Empyrean itself,\\r\\nand with all spiritual life to the very presence of God. It derives its\\r\\nimagery from the cosmology of the day, its dramatic motive from the\\r\\nChristian and Greek conceptions of God and his dealings with the world.\\r\\nSin is punished because of the justice of God; knowledge, virtue, and\\r\\nfaith lead, through God\\'s grace and mercy manifested in Christ, to a\\r\\nperpetual union with Him. Hell, purgatory, and paradise give place and\\r\\nsetting to the events of the drama. But the deeper meaning of the poem\\r\\nis allegorical. In a letter quoted by Lowell, Dante writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The literal subject of the whole work is the state of the\\r\\n     soul after death, simply considered. But if the work be taken\\r\\n     allegorically the subject is man, as by merit or demerit,\\r\\n     through freedom of the will, he renders himself liable to the\\r\\n     reward or punishment of justice.\"[43:4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, the inner and essential meaning of the poem has to do\\r\\nnot with external retribution, but with character, and the laws which\\r\\ndetermine its own proper ruin or perfection. The punishments described\\r\\nin the \"Inferno\" are accounts of the state of guilt itself, implications\\r\\nof the will that has chosen the part of brutishness. Sin itself is\\r\\ndamnable and deadening, but the knowledge that the soul that sinneth\\r\\nshall die is the first way of emancipation from sin. The guidance of\\r\\nVirgil through hell and purgatory signifies the knowledge of good and\\r\\nevil, or moral insight, as the guide of man through this life of\\r\\nstruggle and progress. The earthly paradise, at the close of the\\r\\n\"Purgatorio,\" represents the highest state to which human character can\\r\\nattain when choice is determined by ordinary experience, intelligence,\\r\\nand understanding. Here man stands alone, endowed with an enlightened\\r\\nconscience. Here are uttered the last words of Virgil to Dante, the\\r\\nexplorer of the spiritual country:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Expect no more or word or sign from me. Free, upright, and\\r\\n     sane is thine own free will, and it would be wrong not to act\\r\\n     according to its pleasure; wherefore thee over thyself I crown\\r\\n     and mitre.\"[44:5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut moral self-reliance is not the last word. As Beatrice, the image of\\r\\ntenderness and holiness, comes to Dante in the earthly paradise, and\\r\\nleads him from the summit of purgatory into the heaven of heavens, and\\r\\neven to the eternal light; so there is added to the mere human,\\r\\nintellectual, and moral resources of the soul, the sustaining power of\\r\\nthe divine grace, the illuminating power of divine truth, and the\\r\\ntransforming power of divine love. Through the aid of this higher\\r\\nwisdom, the journey of life becomes the way to God. Thus the allegorical\\r\\ntruth of the \"Divina Commedia\" is not merely an analysis of the moral\\r\\nnature of man, but the revelation of a universal spiritual order,\\r\\nmanifesting itself in the moral evolution of the individual, and above\\r\\nall in his ultimate community with the eternal goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Thou shouldst not, if I deem aright, wonder more at thy\\r\\n     ascent, than at a stream if from a high mountain it descends\\r\\n     to the base. A marvel it would be in thee, if, deprived of\\r\\n     hindrance, thou hadst sat below, even as quiet by living fire\\r\\n     in earth would be.\"[45:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, in brief, is Dante\\'s world-view, so suggestive of the freer\\r\\nidealistic conceptions of later thought as to justify a recent\\r\\ncharacterization of him as one who, \"accepting without a shadow of a\\r\\ndoubt or hesitation all the constitutive ideas of medi\\xc3\\xa6val thought and\\r\\nlife, grasped them so firmly and gave them such luminous expression that\\r\\nthe spirit in them broke away from the form.\"[46:7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it must be added, as in the case of Wordsworth, that Dante is a\\r\\nphilosopher-poet not because St. Thomas Aquinas appears and speaks with\\r\\nauthority in the Thirteenth Canto of the \"Paradiso,\" nor even because a\\r\\nphilosophical doctrine can be consistently formulated from his writings,\\r\\nbut because his consciousness of life is informed with a sense of its\\r\\nuniversal bearings. There is a famous passage in the Twenty-second Canto\\r\\nof the \"Paradiso,\" in which Dante describes himself as looking down upon\\r\\nthe earth from the starry heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"\\'Thou art so near the ultimate salvation,\\' began Beatrice,\\r\\n     \\'that thou oughtest to have thine eyes clear and sharp. And\\r\\n     therefore ere thou further enterest it, look back downward,\\r\\n     and see how great a world I have already set beneath thy feet,\\r\\n     in order that thy heart, so far as it is able, may present\\r\\n     itself joyous to the triumphant crowd which comes glad through\\r\\n     this round ether.\\' With my sight I returned through each and\\r\\n     all the seven spheres, and saw this globe such that I smiled\\r\\n     at its mean semblance; and that counsel I approve as the best\\r\\n     which holds it of least account; and he who thinks of other\\r\\n     things maybe called truly worthy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDante\\'s scale of values is that which appears from the starry heaven.\\r\\nHis austere piety, his invincible courage, and his uncompromising hatred\\r\\nof wrong, are neither accidents of temperament nor blind reactions, but\\r\\ncompose the proper character of one who has both seen the world from\\r\\nGod, and returned to see God from the world. He was, as Lowell has said,\\r\\n\"a man of genius who could hold heartbreak at bay for twenty years, and\\r\\nwould not let himself die till he had done his task\"; and his power was\\r\\nnot obstinacy, but a vision of the ways of God. He knew a truth that\\r\\njustified him in his sacrifices, and made a great glory of his defeat\\r\\nand exile. Even so his poetry or appreciation of life is the expression\\r\\nof an inward contemplation of the world in its unity or essence. It is\\r\\nbut an elaboration of the piety which he attributes to the lesser saints\\r\\nof paradise, when he has them say:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Nay, it is essential to this blessed existence to hold\\r\\n     ourselves within the divine will, whereby our very wills are\\r\\n     made one. So that as we are from stage to stage throughout\\r\\n     this realm, to all the realm is pleasing, as to the King who\\r\\n     inwills us with His will. And His will is our peace; it is\\r\\n     that sea whereunto is moving all that which It creates and\\r\\n     which nature makes.\"[47:8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Difference between Poetry and Philosophy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 14. There now remains the brief task of distinguishing the\\r\\nphilosopher-poet from the philosopher himself. The philosopher-poet is\\r\\none who, having made the philosophical point of view his own, expresses\\r\\nhimself in the form of poetry. The philosophical point of view is that\\r\\nfrom which the universe is comprehended in its totality. The wisdom of\\r\\nthe philosopher is the knowledge of each through the knowledge of all.\\r\\nWherein, then, does the poet, when possessed of such wisdom, differ from\\r\\nthe philosopher proper? To this question one can give readily enough the\\r\\ngeneral answer, that the difference lies in the mode of utterance.\\r\\nFurthermore, we have already given some account of the peculiar manner\\r\\nof the poet. He invites us to experience with him the beautiful and\\r\\nmoving in nature and life. That which the poet has to express, and that\\r\\nwhich he aims to arouse in others, is an appreciative experience. He\\r\\nrequires what Wordsworth calls \"an atmosphere of sensation in which to\\r\\nmove his wings.\" Therefore if he is to be philosophical in intelligence,\\r\\nand yet essentially a poet, he must find his universal truth in\\r\\nimmediate experience. He must be one who, in seeing the many, sees the\\r\\none. The philosopher-poet is he who visualizes a fundamental\\r\\ninterpretation of the world. \"A poem,\" says one poet, \"is the very image\\r\\nof life expressed in its eternal truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe philosopher proper, on the other hand, has the sterner and less\\r\\ninviting task of rendering such an interpretation articulate to thought.\\r\\nThat which the poet sees, the philosopher must define. That which the\\r\\npoet divines, the philosopher must calculate. The philosopher must dig\\r\\nfor that which the poet sees shining through. As the poet transcends\\r\\nthought for the sake of experience, the philosopher must transcend\\r\\nexperience for the sake of thought. As the poet sees all, and all in\\r\\neach, so the philosopher, knowing each, must think all consistently\\r\\ntogether, and then know each again. It is the part of philosophy to\\r\\ncollect and criticise evidence, to formulate and co\\xc3\\xb6rdinate conceptions,\\r\\nand finally to define in exact terms. The reanimation of the structure\\r\\nof thought is accomplished primarily in religion, which is a general\\r\\nconception of the world made the basis of daily living.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor religion there is no subjective correlative less than life itself.\\r\\nPoetry is another and more circumscribed means of restoring thought to\\r\\nlife. By the poet\\'s imagination, and through the art of his expression,\\r\\nthought may be sensuously perceived. \"If the time should ever come,\"\\r\\nsays Wordsworth, \"when what is now called Science, thus familiarized to\\r\\nmen, shall be ready to put on, as it were, a form of flesh, and blood,\\r\\nthe Poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration, and\\r\\nwill welcome the Being thus produced, as a dear and genuine inmate of\\r\\nthe household of man.\"[50:9] As respects truth, philosophy has an\\r\\nindubitable priority. The very sternness of the philosopher\\'s task is\\r\\ndue to his supreme dedication to truth. But if validity be the merit of\\r\\nphilosophy, it can well be supplemented by immediacy, which is the merit\\r\\nof poetry. Presuppose in the poet conviction of a sound philosophy, and\\r\\nwe may say with Shelley, of his handiwork, that \"it is the perfect and\\r\\nconsummate surface and bloom of all things; it is as the odor and the\\r\\ncolor of the rose to the texture of the elements which compose it, as\\r\\nthe form and splendor of unfaded beauty to the secrets of anatomy and\\r\\ncorruption.\" \"Indeed,\" as he adds, \"what were our consolations on this\\r\\nside of the grave--and our aspirations beyond it--if poetry did not\\r\\nascend to bring light and fire from those eternal regions where the\\r\\nowl-winged faculty of calculation dare not ever soar?\"[51:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unity in outlook, attended by differences of method and form, which\\r\\nmay exist between poet and philosopher, is signally illustrated by the\\r\\nrelation between Goethe and Spinoza. What Goethe saw and felt, Spinoza\\r\\nproved and defined. The universal and eternal substance was to Spinoza,\\r\\nas philosopher, a theorem, and to Goethe, as poet, a perception and an\\r\\nemotion. Goethe writes to Jacobi that when philosophy \"lays itself out\\r\\nfor division,\" he cannot get on with it, but when it \"confirms our\\r\\noriginal feeling as though we were one with nature,\" it is welcome to\\r\\nhim. In the same letter Goethe expresses his appreciation of Spinoza as\\r\\nthe complement of his own nature:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"His all-reconciling peace contrasted with my all-agitating\\r\\n     endeavor; his intellectual method was the opposite counterpart\\r\\n     of my poetic way of feeling and expressing myself; and even\\r\\n     the inflexible regularity of his logical procedure, which\\r\\n     might be considered ill-adapted to moral subjects, made me his\\r\\n     most passionate scholar and his devoted adherent. Mind and\\r\\n     heart, understanding and sense, were drawn together with an\\r\\n     inevitable elective affinity, and this at the same time\\r\\n     produced an intimate union between individuals of the most\\r\\n     different types.\"[51:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears, then, that some poets share with all philosophers that\\r\\npoint of view from which the horizon line is the boundary of all the\\r\\nworld. Poetry is not always or essentially philosophical, but may be so;\\r\\nand when the poetic imagination restores philosophy to immediacy, human\\r\\nexperience reaches its most exalted state, excepting only religion\\r\\nitself, wherein God is both seen and also served. Nor is the part of\\r\\nphilosophy in poetry and religion either ignoble or presumptuous, for,\\r\\nhumanly speaking, \"the owl-winged faculty of calculation\" is the only\\r\\nsafe and sure means of access to that place on high,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Where the nightingale doth sing\\r\\n      Not a senseless, tranc\\xc3\\xa8d thing,\\r\\n      But a divine melodious truth;\\r\\n      Philosophic numbers smooth;\\r\\n      Tales and golden histories\\r\\n      Of heaven and its mysteries.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[28:1] George Santayana, in his _Poetry and Religion_, p. 176.\\r\\n\\r\\n[30:2] Santayana: _op. cit._, p. 180.\\r\\n\\r\\n[42:3] _Appreciations_, p. 59.\\r\\n\\r\\n[43:4] Letter to Can Grande.

The least religious experience is so mysterious and so complex\\r\\nthat a moderate degree of reflection upon it tends to a sense of\\r\\nintellectual impotence. \"If I speak,\" says Emerson, \"I define and\\r\\nconfine, and am less.\" One would gladly set down religion among the\\r\\nunspeakable things and avoid the imputation of degrading it. It is\\r\\ncertain that the enterprise of defining religion is at present in\\r\\ndisrepute. It has been undertaken so often and so unsuccessfully that\\r\\ncontemporary students for the most part prefer to supply a list of\\r\\nhistorical definitions of religion, and let their variety demonstrate\\r\\ntheir futility. Metaphysicians and psychologists agree that in view of\\r\\nthe differences of creed, ritual, organization, conduct, and temperament\\r\\nthat have been true of different religions in different times and\\r\\nplaces, one may as well abandon the idea that there is a constant\\r\\nelement.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the other hand we have the testimony afforded by the name\\r\\nreligion; and the ordinary judgments of men to the effect that it\\r\\nsignifies something to be religious, and to be more or less religious.\\r\\nThere is an elementary logical principle to the effect that a group name\\r\\nimplies certain common group characters. Impatience with abstract or\\r\\neuphemistic definitions should not blind us to the truth. Even the\\r\\npsychologist tends in his description of religious phenomena to single\\r\\nout and emphasize what he calls a _typical_ religious experience. And\\r\\nthe same applies to the idealist\\'s treatment of the matter.[54:1]\\r\\nReligion, he reasons, is essentially a development of which the true\\r\\nmeaning can be seen only in the higher stages. The primitive religion is\\r\\ntherefore only implicit religion. But lower stages cannot be regarded as\\r\\nbelonging to a single development with higher stages, if there be not\\r\\nsome actual promise of the later in the earlier, or some element which\\r\\nendures throughout. It is unavoidable, then, to assume that in dealing\\r\\nwith religion we are dealing with a specific and definable experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Profitableness of Defining Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 16. The profitableness of undertaking such a definition is another\\r\\nmatter. It may well be that in so human and practical an affair as\\r\\nreligion, definition is peculiarly inappropriate. But is there not a\\r\\nhuman and practical value in the very defining of religion? Is there not\\r\\na demand for it in the peculiar relation that exists between religion\\r\\nand the progress of enlightenment? Religion associates itself with the\\r\\nhabits of society. The progress of enlightenment means that more or less\\r\\nall the time, and very profoundly at certain critical times, society\\r\\nmust change its habits. The consequence is that religion is likely to be\\r\\nabandoned with the old habits. The need of a new religion is therefore a\\r\\nchronic one. The reformer in religion, or the man who wishes to be both\\r\\nenlightened and religious, is chiefly occupied with the problem of\\r\\ndisentangling religion pure and undefiled from definite discredited\\r\\npractices and opinions. And the solution of the problem turns upon some\\r\\napprehension of the essence of religion. There is a large amount of\\r\\nnecessary and unnecessary tragedy due to the extrinsic connection\\r\\nbetween ideas and certain modes of their expression. There can be no\\r\\nmore serious and urgent duty than that of expressing as directly, and so\\r\\nas truly as possible, the great permanent human concerns. The men to\\r\\nwhom educational reform has been largely due have been the men who have\\r\\nremembered for their fellows what this whole business of education is\\r\\nafter all for. Comenius and Pestalozzi served society by stripping\\r\\neducational activity of its historical and institutional accessories,\\r\\nand laying bare the genuine human need that these are designed to\\r\\nsatisfy. There is a similar virtue in the insistent attempt to\\r\\ndistinguish between the essential and the accessory in religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The True Method of Defining Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 17. Although declining to be discouraged by the conspicuousness of\\r\\npast failures in this connection, one may well profit by them. The\\r\\namazing complexity of religious phenomena must somehow be seen to be\\r\\nconsistent with their common nature. The religious experience must not\\r\\nonly be found, but must also be reconciled with \"the varieties of\\r\\nreligious experience.\" The inadequacy of the well-known definitions of\\r\\nreligion may be attributed to several causes. The commonest fallacy is\\r\\nto define religion in terms of a religion. My definition of religion\\r\\nmust include my brother\\'s religion, even though he live on the other\\r\\nside of the globe, and my ancestor\\'s religion, in spite of his\\r\\nprehistoric remoteness. Error may easily arise through the attempt to\\r\\ndefine religion in terms of my own religion, or what I conceive to be\\r\\nthe true religion. Whatever the relation between ideal religion and\\r\\nactual religion, the field of religion contains by common consent cults\\r\\nthat must on their own grounds condemn one another; religions that are\\r\\nbad religions, and yet religions.\\r\\n\\r\\nA more enlightened fallacy, and a more dangerous one, is due to the\\r\\nsupposition that religion can be defined exclusively in terms of some\\r\\ndepartment of human nature. There have been descriptions of religion in\\r\\nterms of feeling, intellect, and conduct respectively. But it is always\\r\\neasy to overthrow such a description, by raising the question of its\\r\\napplication to evidently religious experiences that belong to some other\\r\\naspect of life. Religion is not feeling, because there are many\\r\\nphlegmatic, God-fearing men whose religion consists in good works.\\r\\nReligion is not conduct, for there are many mystics whose very religion\\r\\nis withdrawal from the field of action. Religion is not intellection,\\r\\nfor no one has ever been able to formulate a creed that is common to all\\r\\nreligions. Yet without a doubt one must look for the essence of religion\\r\\nin human nature. The present psychological interest in religion has\\r\\nemphasized this truth. How, then, may we describe it in terms of\\r\\ncertain constant conditions of human life, and yet escape the\\r\\nabstractness of the facultative method? Modern psychology suggests an\\r\\nanswer in demonstrating the interdependence of knowledge, feeling, and\\r\\nvolition.[58:2] The perfect case of this unity is _belief_. The\\r\\nbelieving experience is cognitive in intent, but practical and emotional\\r\\nas well in content. I believe what I take for granted; and the object of\\r\\nmy belief is not merely known, but also felt and acted upon. _What I\\r\\nbelieve expresses itself in my total experience._\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some hope, then, of an adequate definition of the religious\\r\\nexperience, if it be regarded as belonging to the psychological type of\\r\\nbelief.[58:3] Belief, however, is a broader category than religion.\\r\\nThere must be some _religious type_ of believing. An account of religion\\r\\nin terms of believing, and the particular type of it here in question,\\r\\nwould, then, constitute the central stem of a psychology of religion,\\r\\nand affords the proper conceptions for a description of the religious\\r\\nexperience. Even here the reservation must be made that belief is always\\r\\nmore than the believing _state_, in that it means to be _true_.[59:4]\\r\\nHence to complete an account of religion one should consider its object,\\r\\nor its cognitive implications. But this direct treatment of the relation\\r\\nbetween religion and philosophy must be deferred until in the present\\r\\nchapter we shall have come to appreciate the inwardness of the religious\\r\\nconsciousness. To this end we must permit ourselves to be enlightened by\\r\\nthe experience of religious people as viewed from within. It is not our\\r\\nopinion of a man\\'s religion that is here in question, but the content\\r\\nand meaning which it has for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I would have you,\" says Fielding, in his \"Hearts of Men,\" \"go\\r\\n     and kneel beside the Mahommedan as he prays at the sunset\\r\\n     hour, and put your heart to his and wait for the echo that\\r\\n     will surely come. . . . I would have you go to the hillman\\r\\n     smearing the stone with butter that his god may be pleased, to\\r\\n     the woman crying to the forest god for her sick child, to the\\r\\n     boy before his monks learning to be good. No matter where you\\r\\n     go, no matter what the faith is called, if you have the\\r\\n     hearing ear, if your heart is in unison with the heart of the\\r\\n     world, you will hear always the same song.\"[59:5]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religion as Belief.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 18. The general identification of religion with belief is made without\\r\\nserious difficulty. The essential factor in belief, is, as we have seen,\\r\\nthe reaction of the whole personality to a fixed object or accepted\\r\\nsituation. A similar principle underlies common judgments about a man\\'s\\r\\nreligion. He is accounted most religious whose religion penetrates his\\r\\nlife most intimately. In the man whose religion consists in the outer\\r\\nexercise of attendance upon church, we recognize the sham. He _appears_\\r\\nto be religious. He does one of the things which a religious man would\\r\\ndo; but an object of religious faith is not the constant environment of\\r\\nhis life. He may or may not feel sure of God from his pew, but God is\\r\\nnot among the things that count in his daily life. God does not enter\\r\\ninto his calculations or determine his scale of values. Again,\\r\\ndiscursive thinking is regarded as an interruption of religion. When I\\r\\nam at pains to justify my religion, I am already doubting; and for\\r\\ncommon opinion doubt is identical with irreligion. In so far as I am\\r\\nreligious, my religion stands in no need of justification, even though I\\r\\nregard it as justifiable. In my religious experience I am taking\\r\\nsomething for granted; in other words I act about it and feel about it\\r\\nin a manner that is going to be determined by the special conditions of\\r\\nmy mood and temperament. The mechanical and prosaic man acknowledges God\\r\\nin his mechanical and prosaic way. He believes in divine retribution as\\r\\nhe believes in commercial or social retribution. He is as careful to\\r\\nprepare for the next world as he is to be respectable in this. The poet,\\r\\non the other hand, believes in God after the manner of his genius.\\r\\nThough he worship God in spirit he may conduct his life in an irregular\\r\\nmanner peculiar to himself. Difference of mood in the same individual\\r\\nmay be judged by the same measure. When God is most real to him, brought\\r\\nhome to him most vividly, or consciously obeyed, in these moments he is\\r\\nmost religious. When, on the other hand, God is merely a name to him,\\r\\nand church a routine, or when both are forgotten in the daily\\r\\noccupations, he is least religious. His life on the whole is said to be\\r\\nreligious in so far as periods of the second type are subordinated to\\r\\nperiods of the first type. Further well-known elements of belief,\\r\\ncorollaries of the above, are evidently present in religion. A certain\\r\\n_imagery remains constant_ throughout an individual\\'s experience. He\\r\\ncomes back to it as to a physical object in space. And although religion\\r\\nis sporadically an exclusive and isolated affair, it tends strongly to\\r\\nbe social. The religious object, or God, is a social object, common to\\r\\nme and to my neighbor, and presupposed in our collective undertakings.\\r\\nThis reduction of religion to the type of the believing state should\\r\\nthus provide us with an answer to that old and fundamental question\\r\\nconcerning the relative priority of faith and works. The test of the\\r\\nfaith is in the works, and the works are religious in so far as they are\\r\\nthe expression of the faith. Religion is not the doing of anything nor\\r\\nthe feeling of anything nor the thinking of anything, but the reacting\\r\\nas a whole, in terms of all possible activities of human life, to some\\r\\naccepted situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religion as Belief in a Disposition or Attitude.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 19. We may now face the more interesting but difficult question of the\\r\\nspecial character of religious belief. In spite of the fact that in\\r\\nthese days the personality of God is often regarded as a transient\\r\\nfeature of religion, that type of belief which throws most light upon\\r\\nthe religious experience is the _belief in persons_. Our belief in\\r\\npersons consists in the practical recognition of a more or less\\r\\npersistent disposition toward ourselves. The outward behavior of our\\r\\nfellow-men is construed in terms of the practical bearing of the\\r\\nattitude which it implies. The extraordinary feature of such belief is\\r\\nthe disproportion between its vividness and the direct evidence for it.\\r\\nOf this we are most aware in connection with those personalities which\\r\\nwe regard as distinctly friendly or hostile to ourselves. We are always\\r\\nmore or less clearly in the presence of our friends and enemies. Their\\r\\nwell-wishing or their ill-wishing haunts the scene of our living. There\\r\\nis no more important constituent of what the psychologists call our\\r\\n\"general feeling tone.\" There are times when we are entirely possessed\\r\\nby a state that is either exuberance in the presence of those who love\\r\\nus, or awkwardness and stupidity in the presence of those whom we\\r\\nbelieve to suspect and dislike us. The latter state may easily become\\r\\nchronic. Many men live permanently in the presence of an accusing\\r\\naudience. The inner life which expresses itself in the words, \"Everybody\\r\\nhates me!\" is perhaps the most common form of morbid self-consciousness.\\r\\nOn the other hand, buoyancy of spirits springs largely from a constant\\r\\nfaith in the good-will of one\\'s fellows. In this case one is filled with\\r\\na sense of security, and is conscious of a sympathetic reinforcement\\r\\nthat adds to private joys and compensates for private sorrows. And this\\r\\nsense of attitude is wonderfully discriminating. We can feel the\\r\\npresence of a \"great man,\" a \"formidable person,\" a superior or\\r\\ninferior, one who is interested or indifferent to our talk, and all the\\r\\nsubtlest degrees of approval and disapproval.\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar sensibility may quicken us even in situations where no direct\\r\\nindividual attitude to ourselves is implied. We regard places and\\r\\ncommunities as congenial when we are in sympathy with the prevailing\\r\\npurposes or standards of value. We may feel ill at ease or thoroughly at\\r\\nhome in cities where we know no single human soul. Indeed, in a\\r\\nmisanthrope like Rousseau (and who has not his Rousseau moods!) the mere\\r\\nabsence of social repression arouses a most intoxicating sense of\\r\\ntunefulness and security. Nature plays the part of an indulgent parent\\r\\nwho permits all sorts of personal liberties.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The view of a fine country, a succession of agreeable\\r\\n     prospects, a free air, a good appetite, and the health I gain\\r\\n     by walking; the freedom of inns, and the distance from\\r\\n     everything that can make me recollect the dependence of my\\r\\n     situation, conspire to free my soul, and give boldness to my\\r\\n     thoughts, throwing me, in a manner, into the immensity of\\r\\n     things, where I combine, choose, and appropriate them to my\\r\\n     fancy, without restraint or fear. I dispose of all nature as I\\r\\n     please.\"[64:6]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religion as Belief in the Disposition of the Residual\\r\\nEnvironment, or Universe.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 20. In such confidence or distrust, inspired originally by the social\\r\\nenvironment, and similarly suggested by other surroundings of life, we\\r\\nhave the key to the religious consciousness. But it is now time to add\\r\\nthat in the case of religion these attitudes are concerned with the\\r\\nuniversal or supernatural rather than with present and normal human\\r\\nrelationships. Religious reactions are \"total reactions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To get at them,\" says William James, \"you must go behind the\\r\\n     foreground of existence and reach down to that curious _sense\\r\\n     of the whole residual cosmos as an everlasting presence_,\\r\\n     intimate or alien, terrible or amusing, lovable or odious,\\r\\n     which in some degree everyone possesses. This _sense of the\\r\\n     world\\'s presence_, appealing as it does to our peculiar\\r\\n     individual temperament, makes us either strenuous or careless,\\r\\n     devout or blasphemous, gloomy or exultant about life at large;\\r\\n     and our reaction, involuntary and inarticulate and often half\\r\\n     unconscious as it is, is the completest of all our answers to\\r\\n     the question, \\'What is the character of this universe in which\\r\\n     we dwell?\\'\"[65:7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis _residual environment_, or profounder realm of tradition and\\r\\nnature, may have any degree of unity from chaos to cosmos. For religion\\r\\nits significance lies in the idea of original and far-reaching power\\r\\nrather than in the idea of totality. But that which is at first only\\r\\n\"beyond,\" is _practically_ the same object as that which comes in the\\r\\ndevelopment of thought to be conceived as the \"world\" or the \"universe.\"\\r\\nWe may therefore use these latter terms to indicate the object of\\r\\nreligion, until the treatment of special instances shall define it more\\r\\nprecisely. Religion is, then, _man\\'s sense of the disposition of the\\r\\nuniverse to himself_. We shall expect to find, as in the social\\r\\nphenomena with which we have just dealt, that the manifestation of this\\r\\nsense consists in a general reaction appropriate to the disposition so\\r\\nattributed. He will be fundamentally ill at ease, profoundly confident,\\r\\nor will habitually take precautions to be safe. The ultimate nature of\\r\\nthe world is here no speculative problem. The savage who could feel some\\r\\njoy at living in the universe would be more religious than the sublimest\\r\\ndialectician. It is in the vividness of the sense of this presence that\\r\\nthe acuteness of religion consists. I am religious in so far as the\\r\\nwhole tone and temper of my living reflects a belief as to what the\\r\\nuniverse thinks of such as me.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Examples of Religious Belief.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 21. The examples that follow are selected because their differences\\r\\nin personal flavor serve to throw into relief their common religious\\r\\ncharacter. Theodore Parker, in describing his own boyhood, writes as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I can hardly think without a shudder of the terrible effect\\r\\n     the doctrine of eternal damnation had on me. How many, many\\r\\n     hours have I wept with terror as I lay on my bed, till,\\r\\n     between praying and weeping, sleep gave me repose. But before\\r\\n     I was nine years old this fear went away, and I saw clearer\\r\\n     light in the goodness of God. But for years, say from seven\\r\\n     till ten, I said my prayers with much devotion, I think, and\\r\\n     then continued to repeat, \\'Lord, forgive my sins,\\' till sleep\\r\\n     came on me.\"[67:8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompare with this Stevenson\\'s Christmas letter to his mother, in which\\r\\nhe says:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The whole necessary morality is kindness; and it should\\r\\n     spring, of itself, from the one fundamental doctrine, Faith.\\r\\n     If you are sure that God, in the long run, means kindness by\\r\\n     you, you should be happy; and if happy, surely you should be\\r\\n     kind.\"[67:9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is destiny frowning and destiny smiling, but in each case so real,\\r\\nso present, as to be immediately responded to with helpless terror and\\r\\nwith grateful warm-heartedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author of the \"Imitatio Christi\" speaks thus of the daily living of\\r\\nthe Christian:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The life of a Christian who has dedicated himself to the\\r\\n     service of God should abound with eminent virtues of all\\r\\n     kinds, that he may be really the same person which he is by\\r\\n     outward appearance and profession. Indeed, he ought not only\\r\\n     to be the same, but much more, in his inward disposition of\\r\\n     soul; because he professes to serve a God who sees the inward\\r\\n     parts, a searcher of the heart and reins, a God and Father of\\r\\n     spirits: and therefore, since we are always in His sight, we\\r\\n     should be exceedingly careful to avoid all impurity, all that\\r\\n     may give offence to Him whose eyes cannot behold iniquity. We\\r\\n     should, in a word, so far as mortal and frail nature can,\\r\\n     imitate the blessed angels in all manner of holiness, since\\r\\n     we, as well as they, are always in His presence. . . . And good\\r\\n     men have always this notion of the thing. For they depend upon\\r\\n     God for the success of all they do, even of their best and\\r\\n     wisest undertakings.\"[68:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is to be the practical acknowledgment of God in the routine of\\r\\nlife. The more direct response to this presence appears abundantly in\\r\\nSt. Augustine\\'s conversation and reminiscence with God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"How evil have not my deeds been; or if not my deeds my words;\\r\\n     or if not my words my will? But Thou, O Lord, art good and\\r\\n     merciful, and Thy right hand had respect unto the profoundness\\r\\n     of my death, and removed from the bottom of my heart that\\r\\n     abyss of corruption. And this was the result, that I willed\\r\\n     not to do what I willed, and willed to do what thou\\r\\n     willedst. . . . How sweet did it suddenly become to me to be\\r\\n     without the delights of trifles! And what at one time I\\r\\n     feared to lose, it was now a joy to me to put away. For Thou\\r\\n     didst cast them away from me, Thou true and highest sweetness.\\r\\n     Thou didst cast them away, and instead of them didst enter in\\r\\n     Thyself--sweeter than all pleasure, though not to flesh and\\r\\n     blood; brighter than all light, but more veiled than all\\r\\n     mysteries; more exalted than all honor, but not to the exalted\\r\\n     in their own conceits. Now was my soul free from the gnawing\\r\\n     cares of seeking and getting. . . . And I babbled unto Thee my\\r\\n     brightness, my riches, and my health, the Lord my God.\"[69:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn these two passages we meet with religious conduct and with the\\r\\nsupreme religious experience, the direct worship of God. In each case\\r\\nthe heart of the matter is an individual\\'s indubitable conviction of the\\r\\nworld\\'s favorable concern for him. The deeper order of things\\r\\nconstitutes the real and the profoundly congenial community in which he\\r\\nlives.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Typical Religious Phenomena: Conversion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 22. Let us now apply this general account of the religious experience\\r\\nto certain typical religious phenomena: _conversion_; _piety_; and\\r\\nreligious _instruments_, _symbolisms_, _and_ modes of _conveyance_.\\r\\nAlthough recent study of the phenomenon of _conversion_ has brought to\\r\\nlight a considerable amount of interesting material, there is some\\r\\ndanger of misconceiving its importance. The psychology of conversion is\\r\\nprimarily the psychology of crisis or radical alteration, rather than\\r\\nthe psychology of religion. For the majority of religious men and women\\r\\nconversion is an insignificant event, and in very many cases it never\\r\\noccurs at all. Religion is more purely present where it is normal and\\r\\nmonotonous. But this phenomenon is nevertheless highly significant in\\r\\nthat religion and irreligion are placed in close juxtaposition, and the\\r\\ncontribution of religion at its inception thereby emphasized. In general\\r\\nit is found that conversion takes place during the period of\\r\\nadolescence. But this is the time of the most sudden expansion of the\\r\\nenvironment of life; a time when there is the awakening consciousness of\\r\\nmany a new presence. This is sometimes expressed by saying that it is a\\r\\nperiod of acute self-consciousness. Life is conscious of itself as over\\r\\nagainst its inheritance; the whole setting of life sweeps into view.\\r\\nSome solution of the life problem, some coming to terms with the\\r\\nuniverse, is the normal issue of it. Religious conversion signifies,\\r\\nthen, that in this fundamental adjustment a man defines and accepts for\\r\\nhis life a certain attitude on the part of the universe. The examples\\r\\ncited by the psychologists, as well as the generalizations which they\\r\\nderive, bear out this interpretation.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"General Booth, the founder of the Salvation Army, considers\\r\\n     that the first vital step in saving outcasts consists in\\r\\n     making them feel that some decent human being cares enough for\\r\\n     them to take an interest in the question whether they are to\\r\\n     rise or sink.\"[71:12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new state is here one of courage and hope stimulated by the glow of\\r\\nfriendly interest. The convert is no longer \"out in the cold.\" He is\\r\\ntold that the world wishes him well, and this is brought home to him\\r\\nthrough representations of the tenderness of Christ, and through the\\r\\ndirect ministerings of those who mediate it. But somehow the convert\\r\\nmust be persuaded to realize all this. He must _believe_ it before it\\r\\ncan mean anything to him. He is therefore urged to pray--a proceeding\\r\\nthat is at first ridiculous to him, since it involves taking for granted\\r\\nwhat he disbelieves. But therein lies the critical point. It is peculiar\\r\\nto the object in this case that it can exist only for one who already\\r\\nbelieves in it. The psychologists call this the element of\\r\\n\"self-surrender.\" To be converted a man must somehow suffer his\\r\\nsurroundings to put into him a new heart, which may thereupon confirm\\r\\nits object. Such belief is tremendously tenacious because it so largely\\r\\ncreates its own evidence. Once believe that \"God, in the long run, means\\r\\nkindness by you,\" and you are likely to stand by it to the end--the more\\r\\nso in this case because the external evidence either way is to the\\r\\naverage man so insufficient. Such a belief as this is inspired in the\\r\\nconvert, not by reasoning, but by all the powers of suggestion that\\r\\npersonality and social contagion can afford.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Piety.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 23. The psychologists describe _piety_ as a sense of unity. One feels\\r\\nafter reading their accounts that they are too abstract. For there are\\r\\nmany kinds of unity, characteristic of widely varying moods and states.\\r\\nAny state of rapt attention is a state of unity, and this occurs in the\\r\\nmost secular and humdrum moments of life. Nor does it help matters to\\r\\nsay that in the case of religion this unity must have been preceded by a\\r\\nstate of division; for we cannot properly characterize any state of mind\\r\\nin terms of another state unless the latter be retained in the former.\\r\\nAnd that which is characteristic of the religious sense of unity would\\r\\nseem to be just such an overcoming of difference. There is a recognition\\r\\nof two distinct attitudes, which may be more or less in sympathy with\\r\\none another, but which are both present even in their fullest harmony.\\r\\nWere I to be taken out of myself so completely as to forget myself, I\\r\\nshould inevitably lose that sense of sympathy from which arises the\\r\\npeculiar exultation of religious faith, a heightened experience of the\\r\\nsame type with the freedom and spontaneity that I experience in the\\r\\npresence of those with whom I feel most in accord. The further graces\\r\\nand powers of religion readily submit to a similar description. My sense\\r\\nof positive sympathy expresses itself in an attitude of well-wishing;\\r\\nliving in an atmosphere of kindness I instinctively endeavor to\\r\\npropagate it. My buoyancy is distinctly of that quality which to a\\r\\nlesser degree is due to any sense of social security; my power is that\\r\\nof one who works in an environment that re\\xc3\\xabnforces him. I experience the\\r\\nobjective or even cosmical character of my enterprises. They have a\\r\\nmomentum which makes me their instrument rather than their perpetrator.\\r\\nA paradoxical relation between religion and morality has always\\r\\ninterested observers of custom and history. Religion is apparently as\\r\\ncapable of the most fiendish malevolence as of the most saintly\\r\\ngentleness. Fielding writes that,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When religion is brought out or into daily life and used as\\r\\n     a guide or a weapon in the world it has no effect either for\\r\\n     good or evil. Its effect is simply in strengthening the heart,\\r\\n     in blinding the eyes, in deafening the ears. It is an\\r\\n     intensive force, an intoxicant. It doubles or trebles a man\\'s\\r\\n     powers. It is an impulsive force sending him headlong down the\\r\\n     path of emotion, whether that path lead to glory or to infamy.\\r\\n     It is a tremendous stimulant, that is all.\"[74:13]\\r\\n\\r\\nReligion does not originate life purposes or define their meaning, but\\r\\nstimulates them by the same means that works in all corporate and social\\r\\nactivity. To work with the universe is the most tremendous incentive\\r\\nthat can appeal to the individual will. Hence in highly ethical\\r\\nreligions the power for good exceeds that of any other social and\\r\\nspiritual agency. Such religion makes present, actual, and real, that\\r\\ngood on the whole which the individual otherwise tends to distinguish\\r\\nfrom that which is good for _him_. In daily life the morally valid and\\r\\nthe practically urgent are commonly arrayed against one another; but the\\r\\nethical religion makes the valid urgent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religious Instruments, Symbolism, and Modes of Conveyance.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 24. The _instruments_ of religion are legion, and it is in order here\\r\\nonly to mention certain prominent cases in which their selection would\\r\\nseem to have direct reference to the provocation and perpetuation of\\r\\nsuch a sense of attitude as we have been describing. This is true in a\\r\\ngeneral way of all _symbolism_. There is no essential difference between\\r\\nthe religious symbol and such symbols as serve to remind us of human\\r\\nrelationships. In both cases the perceptual absence of will is\\r\\ncompensated for by the presence of some object associated with that\\r\\nwill. The function of this object is due to its power to revive and\\r\\nperpetuate a certain special social atmosphere. But the most important\\r\\nvehicle of religion has always been personality. It is, after all, to\\r\\npriests, prophets, and believers that religious cults have owed their\\r\\nlong life. The traits that mark the prophet are both curious and\\r\\nsublime. He is most remarkable for the confidence with which he speaks\\r\\nfor the universe. Whether it be due to lack of a sense of humor or to a\\r\\nprofound conviction of truth, is indifferent to our purpose. The power\\r\\nof such men is undoubtedly in their suggestion of a force greater than\\r\\nthey, whose designs they bring directly and socially to the attention of\\r\\nmen. The prophet in his prophesying is indeed not altogether\\r\\ndistinguished from God, and it is through the mediation of a directly\\r\\nperceptible human attitude that a divine attitude gets itself fixed in\\r\\nthe imagination of the believer. What is true of the prophet is equally\\r\\ntrue of the preacher whose function it is not to represent God in his\\r\\nown person, but to depict him with his tongue. It is generally\\r\\nrecognized that the preacher is neither a moralizer nor a theologian.\\r\\nBut it is less perfectly understood that it is his function to suggest\\r\\nthe presence of God. His proper language is that of the imagination, and\\r\\nthe picture which he portrays is that of a reciprocal social\\r\\nrelationship between man and the Supreme Master of the situation of\\r\\nlife. He will not define God or prove God, but introduce Him and talk\\r\\nabout Him. And at the same time the association of prayer and worship\\r\\nwith his sermon, and the atmosphere created by the meeting together of a\\r\\nbody of disciples, will act as the confirmation of his suggestions of\\r\\nsuch a living presence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _conveyance_ of any single religious cult from generation to\\r\\ngeneration affords a signal illustration of the importance in religion\\r\\nof the recognition of attitude. Religions manage somehow to survive any\\r\\namount of transformation of creed and ritual. It is not what is done, or\\r\\nwhat is thought, that identifies the faith of the first Christians with\\r\\nthat of the last, but a certain reckoning with the disposition of God.\\r\\nThe successive generations of Christians are introduced into the\\r\\nspiritual world of their fathers, with its furnishing of hopes and fears\\r\\nremaining substantially the same; and their Christianity consists in\\r\\ntheir continuing to live in it with only a slight and gradual\\r\\nrenovation. To any given individual God is more or less completely\\r\\nrepresented by his elders in the faith in their exhortations and\\r\\nministerings; and through them he fixes as the centre of his system an\\r\\nimage of God his accuser or redeemer.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Historical Types of Religion. Primitive Religions.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 25. The complete verification of this interpretation of the religious\\r\\nexperience would require the application of it to the different\\r\\nhistorical cults. In general the examination of such instances is\\r\\nentirely beyond the scope of this chapter; but a brief consideration may\\r\\nbe given to those which seem to afford reasonable grounds for objection.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, it may be said that in _primitive religions_, notably in\\r\\nfetichism, tabooism, and totemism, there is no recognition of a cosmical\\r\\nunity. It is quite evident that there is no conception of a universe.\\r\\nBut it is equally evident that the natural and historical environment in\\r\\nits generality has a very specific practical significance for the\\r\\nprimitive believer. It is often said with truth that these earliest\\r\\nreligions are more profoundly pantheistic than polytheistic. Man\\r\\nrecognizes an all-pervading interest that is capable of being directed\\r\\nto himself. The selection of a deity is not due to any special\\r\\nqualification for deification possessed by the individual object itself,\\r\\nbut to the tacit presumption that, as Thales said, \"all things are full\\r\\nof gods.\" The disposition of residual reality manifests to the believer\\r\\nno consistency or unity, but it is nevertheless the most constant object\\r\\nof his will. He lives in the midst of a capriciousness which he must\\r\\nappease if he is to establish himself at all.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Buddhism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 26. Secondly, in the case of _Buddhism_ we are said to meet with a\\r\\nreligion that is essentially atheistic.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whether Buddhas arise, O priests, or whether Buddhas do not\\r\\n     arise, it remains a fact and the fixed and necessary\\r\\n     constitution of being, that all its constituents are\\r\\n     transitory.\"[78:14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secret of life lies in the application of this truth:\\r\\n\\r\\n       \"O builder! I\\'ve discovered thee!\\r\\n     This fabric thou shalt ne\\'er rebuild!\\r\\n     Thy rafters all are broken now,\\r\\n     And pointed roof demolished lies!\\r\\n     This mind has demolition reached,\\r\\n     And seen the last of all desire!\"[78:15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case of Buddha himself and of the exponents of his purely esoteric\\r\\ndoctrine, belong to the reflective type which will presently be given\\r\\nspecial consideration. But with the ordinary believer, even where an\\r\\nextraneous but almost inevitable polytheism is least in evidence, the\\r\\nreligious experience consists in substantially the same elements that\\r\\nappear in theistic religions. The individual is here living\\r\\nappropriately to the ultimate nature of things, with the ceaseless\\r\\nperiods of time in full view. That which is brought home to him is the\\r\\nillusoriness and hollowness of things when taken in the spirit of active\\r\\nendeavor. The only profound and abiding good is nothingness. While\\r\\nnature and society conspire to mock him, Nirvana invites him to its\\r\\npeace. The religious course of his life consists in the use of such\\r\\nmeans as can win him this end. From the stand-point of the universe he\\r\\nhas the sympathy only of that wisdom whose essence is self-destruction.\\r\\nAnd this truth is mediated by the imagination of divine sympathy, for\\r\\nthe Blessed One remains as the perpetual incarnation of his own\\r\\nblessedness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Critical Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 27. Finally there remains the consideration of the bearing of this\\r\\ninterpretation upon the more refined and disciplined religions. The\\r\\nreligion of the critically enlightened man is less naive and credulous\\r\\nin its imagery. God tends to vanish into an ideal or a universal, into\\r\\nsome object of theoretical definition. Here we are on that borderland\\r\\nwhere an assignment of individual cases can never be made with any\\r\\ncertainty of correctness. We can generalize only by describing the\\r\\nconditions that such cases must fulfil if they are properly to be\\r\\ndenominated religious. And there can be no question of the justice of\\r\\nderiving such a description from the reports of historical and\\r\\ninstitutional religions. An idealistic philosophy will, then, be a\\r\\nreligion just in so far as it is rendered practically vivid by the\\r\\nimagination. Such imagination must create and sustain a social\\r\\nrelationship. The question of the legitimacy of this imagination is\\r\\nanother matter. It raises the issue concerning the judgment of truth\\r\\nimplied in religion, and this is the topic of the next chapter. At any\\r\\nrate the religious experience _may be_ realized by virtue of the\\r\\nmetaphorical or poetical representation of a situation as one of\\r\\nintercommunication between persons, where reflective definition at the\\r\\nsame time denies it. The human worshipper may supply the personality of\\r\\nGod from himself, viewing himself as from the divine stand-point. But\\r\\nwhatever faculty supplies this indispensable social quality of religion,\\r\\nhe who defines God as the ultimate goodness or the ultimate truth, has\\r\\ncertainly not yet worshipped Him. He begins to be religious only when\\r\\nsuch an ideal determines the atmosphere of his daily living; when he\\r\\nregards the immanence of such an ideal in nature and history as the\\r\\nobject of his will; and when he responds to its presence in the spirit\\r\\nof his conduct and his contemplation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[54:1] Cf.

It has been maintained that religion is closely analogous to one\\'s\\r\\nbelief in the disposition toward one\\'s self of men or communities. In\\r\\nthe case of religion this disposition is attributed to the more or less\\r\\nvaguely conceived residual environment that is recognized as lying\\r\\noutside of the more familiar natural and social relations. After the\\r\\nrise of science this residual environment tends to be conceived as a\\r\\nunity which is ultimate or fundamental, but for the religious\\r\\nconsciousness it is more commonly regarded as a general source of\\r\\ninfluence practically worthy of consideration. Such a belief, like all\\r\\nbelief, is vitally manifested, with such emphasis upon action, feeling,\\r\\nor intellection as temperament and mood may determine.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religion Means to be True.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 29. But if the psychology of belief is the proper starting-point for a\\r\\ndescription of the religious experience, it is none the less suggestive\\r\\nof the fact that religion, just because it _is_ belief, is not wholly a\\r\\nmatter for psychology. For religion _means to be true_, and thus submits\\r\\nitself to valuation as a case of knowledge. The psychological study of\\r\\nreligion is misleading when accepted as a substitute for philosophical\\r\\ncriticism. The religious man takes his religion not as a narcotic, but\\r\\nas an enlightenment. Its subjective worth is due at any rate in part to\\r\\nthe supposition of its objective worth. As in any case of insight, that\\r\\nwhich warms the heart must have satisfied the mind. The religious\\r\\nexperience purports to be the part of wisdom, and to afford only such\\r\\nhappiness as increasing wisdom would confirm. And the charm of truth\\r\\ncannot survive its truthfulness. Hence, though religion may be\\r\\ndescribed, it cannot be justified, from the stand-point of therapeutics.\\r\\nWere such the case it would be the real problem of religious leaders to\\r\\nfind a drug capable of giving a constantly pleasant tone to their\\r\\npatient\\'s experience.[83:1] There would be no difference between priests\\r\\nand physicians who make a specialty of nervous diseases, except that the\\r\\nformer would aim at a more fundamental and perpetual suggestion of\\r\\nserenity. Now no man wants to be even a blessed fool. He does not want\\r\\nto dwell constantly in a fictitious world, even if it be after his own\\r\\nheart. He may from the cynical point of view actually do so, but if he\\r\\nbe religious he thinks it is reality, and is satisfied only in so far as\\r\\nhe thinks so. He regards the man who has said in his heart that there is\\r\\nno God as the fool, and not because he may have to suffer for it, but\\r\\nbecause he is cognitively blind to the real nature of things. Piety, on\\r\\nthe other hand, he regards as the standard experience, the most\\r\\nveracious life. Hence, it is not an accident that religion has had its\\r\\ncreeds and its controversies, its wars with science and its appeals to\\r\\nphilosophy. The history of these affairs shows that religion commonly\\r\\nfails to understand the scope of its own demand for truth; but they have\\r\\nissued from the deep conviction that one\\'s religion is, implicitly, at\\r\\nleast, in the field of truth; that there are theoretical judgments whose\\r\\ntruth would justify or contradict it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis general fact being admitted, there remains the task to which the\\r\\npresent discussion addresses itself, that of defining the kind of\\r\\n_theoretical judgment_ implied in religion, and the relation to this\\r\\ncentral cognitive stem of its efflorescences of myth, theology, and\\r\\nritual. It is impossible to separate the stem and the efflorescence, or\\r\\nto determine the precise spot at which destruction of the tissue would\\r\\nprove fatal to the plant, but it is possible to obtain some idea of the\\r\\nrelative vitality of the parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Religion Means to be Practically True. God is a Disposition\\r\\nfrom which Consequences May Rationally be Expected.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 30. The difficulty of reaching a definite statement in this matter is\\r\\ndue to the fact that the truth in which any religious experience centres\\r\\nis a practical and not a scientific truth. A practical truth does not\\r\\ncommit itself to any single scientific statement, and can often survive\\r\\nthe overthrow of that scientific statement in which at any given time it\\r\\nhas found expression. In other words, an indefinite number of scientific\\r\\ntruths are compatible with a single practical truth. An instance of this\\r\\nis the consistency with my expectation of the alternation of day and\\r\\nnight, of either the Ptolemaic or Copernican formulation of the solar\\r\\nsystem. Now expectation that the sun will rise to-morrow is an excellent\\r\\nanalogue of my religious belief. Celestial mechanics is as relevant to\\r\\nthe one as metaphysics to the other. Neither is overthrown until a\\r\\ncentral practical judgment is discredited, and either could remain true\\r\\nthrough a very considerable alteration of logical definition; but\\r\\nneither is on this account exempt from theoretical responsibility. In so\\r\\nfar as religion deliberately enters the field of science, and defines\\r\\nits formularies with the historical or metaphysical method, this\\r\\ndifficulty does not, of course, exist. Grant that the years of\\r\\nMethuselah\\'s life, or the precise place and manner of the temptation of\\r\\nJesus, or the definition of Christ in the terms of the Athanasian Creed,\\r\\nare constitutive of Christianity, and the survival of that religion will\\r\\nbe determined by the solution of ordinary problems of historical or\\r\\nmetaphysical research. But the Christian will very properly claim that\\r\\nhis religion is only externally and accidentally related to such\\r\\npropositions, since they are never or very rarely intended in his\\r\\nexperience. As religious he is occupied with Christ as his saviour or\\r\\nwith God as his protector and judge. The history of Jesus or the\\r\\nmetaphysics of God essentially concern him only in so far as they may or\\r\\nmay not invalidate this relationship. He cares only for the power and\\r\\ndisposition of the divine, and these are affected by history and\\r\\nmetaphysics only in so far as he has definitely put them to such proof.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my religion is my sense of a practical situation, and only when\\r\\nthat has been proved to be folly has my religion become untrue. My God\\r\\nis my practical faith, my plan of salvation. My religion is overthrown\\r\\nif I am convinced that I have misconceived the situation and mistaken\\r\\nwhat I should do to be saved. The conception of God is very simple\\r\\npractically, and very complex theoretically, a fact that confirms its\\r\\npractical genesis. My conception of God contains _an idea of my own\\r\\ninterests_, _an idea of the disposition of the universe toward my\\r\\ninterests_, and _some working plan for the reconciliation of these two\\r\\nterms_. These three elements form a practical unity, but each is capable\\r\\nof emphasis, and a religion may be transformed through the modification\\r\\nof any one of them. It appears, then, as has always been somewhat\\r\\nvaguely recognized, that the truth of religion is ethical as well as\\r\\nmetaphysical or scientific. My religion will be altered by a change in\\r\\nmy conception of what constitutes my real interest, a change in my\\r\\nconception of the fundamental causes of reality, or a change in my\\r\\nconception of the manner in which my will may or may not affect these\\r\\ncauses. God is neither an entity nor an ideal, but always a relation of\\r\\nentity to ideal: _reality regarded from the stand-point of its\\r\\nfavorableness or unfavorableness to human life, and prescribing for the\\r\\nlatter the propriety of a certain attitude_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Historical Examples of Religious Truth and Error. The\\r\\nReligion of Baal.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 31. The range of historical examples is limitless, but certain of\\r\\nthese are especially calculated to emphasize the application of a\\r\\ncriterion to religion. Such is the case with Elijah\\'s encounter with the\\r\\nprophets of Baal, as narrated in the Old Testament.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And Elijah came near unto all the people, and said, How long\\r\\n     halt ye between two opinions? If Yahweh be God, follow him:\\r\\n     but if Baal, then follow him. . . . And call ye on the name of\\r\\n     your god, and I will call on the name of Yahweh: and the God\\r\\n     that answereth by fire, let him be God. . . . And Elijah said\\r\\n     unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for\\r\\n     yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on\\r\\n     the name of your god, but put no fire under. And they took the\\r\\n     bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called\\r\\n     on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O\\r\\n     Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that\\r\\n     answered. . . . And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah\\r\\n     mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he\\r\\n     is musing, or he is gone aside, or he is in a journey, or\\r\\n     peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. And they cried\\r\\n     aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and\\r\\n     lances, till the blood gushed out upon them. . . . But there\\r\\n     was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that\\r\\n     regarded.\"[88:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe religion of the followers of Baal here consists in a belief in the\\r\\npractical virtue of a mode of address and form of ritual associated with\\r\\nthe traditions and customs of a certain social group. The prophets of\\r\\nthis cult agree to regard the experiment proposed by Elijah as a crucial\\r\\ntest, and that which is disproved from its failure is a plan of action.\\r\\nThese prophets relied upon the presence of a certain motivity, from\\r\\nwhich a definite response could be evoked by an appeal which they were\\r\\npeculiarly able to make; but though \"they prophesied until the time of\\r\\nthe offering of the evening oblation,\" there was none that regarded.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Greek Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 32. An equally familiar and more instructive example is the refutation\\r\\nof the Greek national religion by Lucretius. The conception of life\\r\\nwhich Lucretius finds unwarranted is best depicted in Homer. There we\\r\\nhear of a society composed of gods and men. Though the gods, on the one\\r\\nhand, have their own history, their affairs are never sharply sundered\\r\\nfrom those of men, who, on the other hand, must constantly reckon with\\r\\nthem, gauge their attitude, and seek their favor by paying tribute to\\r\\ntheir individual humors and preferences. In the Ninth Book of the\\r\\n\"Iliad,\" Phoenix addresses himself to the recalcitrant Achilles as\\r\\nfollows:\\r\\n\\r\\n                         \"It fits not one that moves\\r\\n     The hearts of all, to live unmov\\'d, and succor hates for loves.\\r\\n     The Gods themselves are flexible; whose virtues, honors, pow\\'rs,\\r\\n     Are more than thine, yet they will bend their breasts as we bend\\r\\n         ours.\\r\\n     Perfumes, benign devotions, savors of offerings burn\\'d,\\r\\n     And holy rites, the engines are with which their hearts are turn\\'d,\\r\\n     By men that pray to them.\"[90:3]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a general recognition of that which makes sacrifice rational. It\\r\\nis because he conceives this presupposition to be mistaken, that\\r\\nLucretius declares the practices and fears which are founded upon it to\\r\\nbe folly. It is the same with all that is practically based upon the\\r\\nexpectation of a life beyond the grave. The correction of the popular\\r\\nreligion is due in his opinion to that true view of the world taught by\\r\\nEpicurus, whose memory Lucretius thus invokes at the opening of the\\r\\nThird Book of the \"De Rerum Natura\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Thee, who first wast able amid such thick darkness to raise\\r\\n     on high so bright a beacon and shed a light on the true\\r\\n     interests of life, thee I follow, glory of the Greek race,\\r\\n     and plant now my footsteps firmly fixed in thy imprinted\\r\\n     marks. . . . For soon as thy philosophy issuing from a\\r\\n     godlike intellect has begun with loud voice, to proclaim the\\r\\n     nature of things, the terrors of the mind are dispelled, the\\r\\n     walls of the world part asunder, I see things in operation\\r\\n     throughout the whole void: the divinity of the gods is\\r\\n     revealed and their tranquil abodes which neither winds do\\r\\n     shake nor clouds drench with rains nor snow congealed by sharp\\r\\n     frost harms with hoary fall: an ever cloudless ether\\r\\n     o\\'ercanopies them, and they laugh with light shed largely\\r\\n     round. Nature too supplies all their wants and nothing ever\\r\\n     impairs their peace of mind. But on the other hand the\\r\\n     Acherusian quarters[91:4] are nowhere to be seen, though earth\\r\\n     is no bar to all things being descried, which are in operation\\r\\n     underneath our feet throughout the void.\"[91:5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another passage, after describing the Phrygian worship of Cybele, he\\r\\ncomments as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"All which, well and beautifully as it is set forth and told,\\r\\n     is yet widely removed from true reason. For the nature of gods\\r\\n     must ever in itself of necessity enjoy immortality together\\r\\n     with supreme repose, far removed and withdrawn from our\\r\\n     concerns; since exempt from every pain, exempt from all\\r\\n     dangers, strong in its own resources, not wanting aught of us,\\r\\n     it is neither gained by favors nor moved by anger. . . . The\\r\\n     earth however is at all time without feeling, and because it\\r\\n     receives into it the first-beginnings of many things, it\\r\\n     brings them forth in many ways into the light of the\\r\\n     sun.\"[91:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the teaching of Epicurus be true it is evident that those who\\r\\noffered hecatombs with the idea that they were thereby mitigating anger,\\r\\nor securing special dispensation, were playing the fool. They were\\r\\nappealing to a fictitious motivity, one not grounded in \"the nature of\\r\\nthings.\" To one for whom the walls of the world had parted asunder, such\\r\\na procedure was no longer possible; though he might choose to \"call the\\r\\nsea Neptune\" and reverence the earth as \"mother of the gods.\"[92:7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Judaism and Christianity.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 33. The history of religion contains no more impressive and dramatic\\r\\nchapter than that which records the development of the religion of the\\r\\nJews. Passing over its obscure beginnings in the primitive Semitic cult,\\r\\nwe find this religion first clearly defined as tribal self-interest\\r\\nsanctioned by Yahweh.[92:8] God\\'s interest in his chosen people\\r\\ndetermines the prosperity of him who practices the social virtues.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The name of Yahweh is a strong tower: the righteous runneth\\r\\n     into it, and is safe.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He that is steadfast in righteousness shall attain unto\\r\\n     life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to Yahweh than\\r\\n     sacrifice.\"[93:9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in time it is evident to the believer that his experience does not\\r\\nbear out this expectation. Neither as a Jew nor as a righteous man does\\r\\nhe prosper more than his neighbor. He comes, therefore, to distrust the\\r\\nvirtue of his wisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light\\r\\n     excelleth darkness. The wise man\\'s eyes are in his head, and\\r\\n     the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one\\r\\n     event happeneth to them all. Then said I in my heart, As it\\r\\n     happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why\\r\\n     was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also\\r\\n     was vanity. For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is\\r\\n     no remembrance forever; seeing that in the days to come all\\r\\n     will have been already forgotten. And how doth the wise man\\r\\n     die even as the fool! So I hated life; because the work that\\r\\n     is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me: for all is\\r\\n     vanity and a striving after wind.\"[93:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is evident that he who expects the favor of fortune in return for\\r\\nhis observance of precept is mistaken. The \"work that is wrought under\\r\\nthe sun\" makes no special provision for him during his lifetime. Unless\\r\\nthe cry of vanity is to be the last word there must be a\\r\\nreinterpretation of the promise of God. This appears in the new ideal of\\r\\npatient submission, and the chastened faith that expects only the love\\r\\nof God. And those whom God loves He will not forsake. They will come to\\r\\ntheir own, if not here, then beyond, according to His inscrutable but\\r\\nunswerving plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a\\r\\n     contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth\\r\\n     eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy\\r\\n     place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,\\r\\n     to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of\\r\\n     the contrite ones.\"[94:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this faith Judaism merges into Christianity.[94:12] In the whole\\r\\ncourse of this evolution God is regarded as the friend of his people,\\r\\nbut his people learn to find a new significance in his friendship. That\\r\\nwhich is altered is the conduct which that friendship requires and the\\r\\nexpectation which it determines. The practical ideal which the\\r\\nrelationship sanctions, changes gradually from that of prudence to that\\r\\nof goodness for its own sake. God, once an instrument relevant to human\\r\\ntemporal welfare, has come to be an object of disinterested service.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo such transformation as this was absolutely realized during the period\\r\\ncovered by the writings of the Old Testament, nor has it even yet been\\r\\nrealized in the development of Christianity. But the evolution of both\\r\\nJudaism and Christianity has taken this direction. The criterion of this\\r\\nevolution is manifestly both ethical and metaphysical. A Christian avows\\r\\nthat he rates purity of character above worldly prosperity, so that the\\r\\nformer cannot properly be prized for the sake of the latter.\\r\\nFurthermore, he shares more or less unconsciously such philosophical and\\r\\nscientific opinions as deny truth to the conception of special\\r\\ninterferences and dispensations from a supernatural agency. Therefore he\\r\\nlooks for no fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice. But his religion\\r\\nis nevertheless a practical expectation. He believes that God is good,\\r\\nand that God loves him and sustains him. He believes that there obtains\\r\\nbetween himself, in so far as good, and the universe _sub specie\\r\\neternitatis_, a real sympathy and reciprocal reenforcement. He believes\\r\\nthat he secures through the profoundly potent forces of the universe\\r\\nthat which he regards as of most worth; and that somewhat is added to\\r\\nthese forces by virtue of his consecration. The God of the Christians\\r\\ncannot be defined short of some such account as this, inclusive of an\\r\\nideal, an attitude, and an expectation. In other words the God of the\\r\\nChristians is to be known only in terms of the Christlike outlook upon\\r\\nlife, in which the disciple is taught to emulate the master. When moral\\r\\nand intellectual development shall have discredited either its scale of\\r\\nvalues, or its conviction that cosmical events are in the end determined\\r\\nin accordance with that scale of values, then Christianity must either\\r\\nbe transformed, or be untenable for the wise man. If we have conceived\\r\\nthe essence of Christianity too broadly or vaguely, it does not much\\r\\nmatter for our present purposes. Its essence is, at any rate, some such\\r\\ninwardness of life resolving ideality and reality into one, and drawing\\r\\nupon objective truth only to the extent required for the confirming of\\r\\nthat relation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Cognitive Factor in Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 34. We conclude, then, our attempt to emphasize the cognitive factor\\r\\nin religion, with the thesis that every religion centres in a practical\\r\\nsecret of the universe. _To be religious is to believe that a certain\\r\\ncorrelation of forces, moral and factual, is in reality operative, and\\r\\nthat it determines the propriety and effectiveness of a certain type of\\r\\nliving. Whatever demonstrates the futility, vanity, or self-deception of\\r\\nthis living, discredits the religion. And, per contra, except as they\\r\\ndefine or refute such practical truth, religion is not essentially\\r\\nconcerned with theoretical judgments._\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Place of Imagination in Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 35. But neither religion nor any other human interest consists in\\r\\nessentials. Such a practical conviction as that which has been defined\\r\\ninevitably flowers into a marvelous complexity, and taps for its\\r\\nnourishment every spontaneity of human nature. If it be said that only\\r\\nthe practical conviction is essential, this is not the same as to say\\r\\nthat all else is superfluous. There may be no single utterance that my\\r\\nreligion could not have spared, and yet were I to be altogether dumb my\\r\\nreligion would, indeed, be as nothing. For if I believe, I accept a\\r\\npresence in my world, which as I live will figure in my dreams, or in my\\r\\nthoughts, or in my habits. And each of these expressions of myself will\\r\\nhave a truth if it do but bear out my practical acceptance of that\\r\\npresence. The language of religion, like that of daily life, is not the\\r\\nlanguage of science except it take it upon itself to be so. There is\\r\\nscarcely a sentence which I utter in my daily intercourse with men which\\r\\nis not guilty of transgressions against the canons of accurate and\\r\\ndefinite thinking. Yet if I deceive neither myself nor another, I am\\r\\nheld to be truthful, even though my language deal with chance and\\r\\naccident, material purposes and spiritual causes, and though I vow that\\r\\nthe sun smiles or the moon lets down her hair into the sea. Science is a\\r\\nspecial interest in the discovery of unequivocal and fixed conceptions,\\r\\nand employs its terms with an unalterable connotation. But no such\\r\\nalgebra of thought is indispensable to life or conversation, and its\\r\\nlack is no proof of error. Such is the case also with that eminently\\r\\nliving affair, religion. I may if I choose, and I will if my reasoning\\r\\npowers be at all awakened, be a theologian. But theology, like science,\\r\\nis a special intellectual spontaneity. St. Thomas, the master\\r\\ntheologian, did not glide unwittingly from prayer into the _qu\\xc3\\xa6stiones_\\r\\nof the \"Summa Theologi\\xc3\\xa6,\" but turned to them as to a fresh adventure.\\r\\nTheology is inevitable, because humanly speaking adventure is\\r\\ninevitable. For man, with his intellectual spontaneity, every object is\\r\\na problem; and did he not seek sooner or later to define salvation,\\r\\nthere would be good reason to believe that he did not practically reckon\\r\\nwith any. But this is _similarly_ and _independently_ true of the\\r\\nimagination, the most familiar means with which man clothes and vivifies\\r\\nhis convictions, the exuberance with which he plays about them and\\r\\ndelights to confess them. The imagination of religion, contributing what\\r\\nMatthew Arnold called its \"poetry and eloquence,\" does not submit itself\\r\\nto such canons as are binding upon theology or science, but exists and\\r\\nflourishes in its own right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indispensableness to religion of the imagination is due to that\\r\\nfaculty\\'s power of realizing what is not perceptually present. Religion\\r\\nis not interested in the apparent, but in the secret essence or the\\r\\ntranscendent universal. And yet this interest is a practical one.\\r\\nImagination may introduce one into the vivid presence of the secret or\\r\\nthe transcendent. It is evident that the religious imagination here\\r\\ncoincides with poetry. For it is at least one of the interests of poetry\\r\\nto cultivate and satisfy a sense for the universal; to obtain an\\r\\nimmediate experience or appreciation that shall have the vividness\\r\\nwithout the particularism of ordinary perception. And where a poet\\r\\nelects so to view the world, we allow him as a poet the privilege, and\\r\\njudge him by the standards to which he submits himself. That upon which\\r\\nwe pass judgment is the _fitness of his expression_. This expression is\\r\\nnot, except in the case of the theoretical mystic, regarded as\\r\\nconstituting the most valid form of the idea, but is appreciated\\r\\nexpressly for its fulfilment of the condition of immediacy. The same\\r\\nsort of critical attitude is in order with the fruits of the religious\\r\\nimagination. These may or may not fulfil enough of the requirements of\\r\\nthat art to be properly denominated poetry; but like poetry they are the\\r\\ntranslation of ideas into a specific language. They must not, therefore,\\r\\nbe judged as though they claimed to excel in point of validity, but only\\r\\nin point of consistency with the context of that language. And _the\\r\\nlanguage of religion is the language of the practical life_. Such\\r\\ntranslation is as essential to an idea that is to enter into the\\r\\nreligious experience, as translation into terms of immediacy is\\r\\nessential to an idea that is to enter into the appreciative\\r\\nconsciousness of the poet. No object can find a place in my religion\\r\\nuntil it is conjoined with my purposes and hopes; until it is taken for\\r\\ngranted and acted upon, like the love of my friends, or the courses of\\r\\nthe stars, or the stretches of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Special Functions of the Religious Imagination.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 36. The religious imagination, then, is to be understood and justified\\r\\nas that which brings the objects of religion within the range of living.\\r\\nThe central religious object, as has been seen, is an _attitude_ of the\\r\\nresiduum or totality of things. To be religious one must have a sense\\r\\nfor the _presence of an attitude_, like his sense for the presence of\\r\\nhis human fellows, with all the added appreciation that is proper in the\\r\\ncase of an object that is unique in its mystery or in its majesty. It\\r\\nfollows that the religious imagination fulfils its function in so far as\\r\\nit provides the object of religion with properties similar to those\\r\\nwhich lend vividness and reality to the normal social relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of one\\'s fellows is in part the perceptual experience of\\r\\ntheir bodies. To this there corresponds in religion some extraordinary\\r\\nor subtle appearance. The gods may in visions or dreams be met with in\\r\\ntheir own proper embodiments; or, as is more common, they may be\\r\\nregarded as present for practical purposes: in some inanimate object,\\r\\nas in the case of the fetish; in some animal species, as in the case of\\r\\nthe totem; in some place, as in the case of the shrine; or even in some\\r\\nhuman being, as in the case of the inspired prophet and miracle worker.\\r\\nIn more refined and highly developed religions the medium of God\\'s\\r\\npresence is less specific. He is perceived with\\r\\n\\r\\n                         \"--a sense sublime\\r\\n     Of something far more deeply interfused,\\r\\n     Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,\\r\\n     And the round ocean and the living air,\\r\\n     And the blue sky, and in the mind of man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGod is here found in an interpretation of the common and the natural,\\r\\nrather than in any individual and peculiar embodiment. And here the\\r\\npoet\\'s appreciation, if not his art, is peculiarly indispensable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, furthermore, his fellows are inmates of \"the household of man\" in\\r\\nthat he knows their history. They belong to the temporal context of\\r\\nactions and events. Similarly, the gods must be historical. The sacred\\r\\ntraditions or books of religion are largely occupied with this history.\\r\\nThe more individual and anthropomorphic the gods, the more local and\\r\\nepisodic will be the account of their affairs. In the higher religions\\r\\nthe acts of God are few and momentous, such as creation or special\\r\\nprovidence; or they are identical with the events of nature and human\\r\\nhistory when these are _construed_ as divine. To find God in this latter\\r\\nway requires an interpretation of the course of events in terms of some\\r\\nmoral consistency, a faith that sees some purpose in their evident\\r\\ndestination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is still another and a more significant way in which men recognize\\r\\none another: the way of address and conversation. And men have\\r\\ninvariably held a similar intercourse with their gods. To this category\\r\\nbelong communion and prayer, with all their varieties of expression. I\\r\\nhave no god until I address him. This will be the most direct evidence\\r\\nof what is at least from my point of view a social relation. There can\\r\\nbe no general definition of the form which this address will take. There\\r\\nmay be as many special languages, as many attitudes, and as much\\r\\nplayfulness and subtlety of symbolism as in human intercourse. But, on\\r\\nthe other hand, there are certain utterances that are peculiarly\\r\\nappropriate to religion. In so far as he regards his object as endowed\\r\\nwith both power and goodness the worshipper will use the language of\\r\\nadoration; and the sense of his dependence will speak in terms of\\r\\nconsecration and thanksgiving.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee:\\r\\n      My soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee,\\r\\n      In a dry and weary land, where no water is.\\r\\n      So have I looked upon thee in the sanctuary,\\r\\n      To see thy power and thy glory.\\r\\n      For thy loving-kindness is better than life;\\r\\n      My lips shall praise thee.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are expressions of a hopeful faith; but, on the other hand, God\\r\\nmay be addressed in terms of hatred and distrust.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Who is most wretched in this dolorous place?\\r\\n      I think myself; yet I would rather be\\r\\n      My miserable self than He, than He\\r\\n      Who formed such creatures to his own disgrace.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The vilest thing must be less vile than Thou\\r\\n      From whom it had its being, God and Lord!\\r\\n      Creator of all woe and sin! abhorred,\\r\\n      Malignant and implacable.\"[104:13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn either case there may be an indefinite degree of hyperbole. The\\r\\nlanguage of love and hate, of confidence and despair, is not the\\r\\nlanguage of description. In this train of the religious consciousness\\r\\nthere is occasion for whatever eloquence man can feel, and whatever\\r\\nrhetorical luxuriance he can utter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Relation between Imagination and Truth in Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 37. Such considerations as these serve to account for the exercise and\\r\\ncertain of the fruits of the religious imagination, and to designate the\\r\\ngeneral criterion governing its propriety. But _how is one to determine\\r\\nthe boundary between the imaginative and the cognitive_? It is commonly\\r\\nagreed that what religion says and does is not all intended literally.\\r\\nBut when is expression of religion only poetry and eloquence, and when\\r\\nis it matter of conviction? If we revert again to the cognitive aspect\\r\\nof religion, it is evident that there is but one test to apply:\\r\\n_whatever either fortifies or misleads the will is literal conviction_.\\r\\nThis test cannot be applied absolutely, because it can properly be\\r\\napplied only to the intention of an individual experience. However I may\\r\\nexpress my religion, that which I express, is, we have seen, an\\r\\nexpectation. The degree to which I literally mean what I say is then the\\r\\ndegree to which it determines my expectations. Whatever adds no item to\\r\\nthese expectations, but only recognizes and vitalizes them, is pure\\r\\nimagination. But it follows that it is entirely impossible from direct\\r\\ninspection to define any given _expression_ of religious experience as\\r\\nmyth, or to define the degree to which it is myth. It submits to such\\r\\ndistinctions only when viewed from the stand-point of the concrete\\r\\nreligious experience which it expresses. Any such given expression could\\r\\neasily be all imagination to one, and all conviction to another.\\r\\nConsider the passage which follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And I saw the heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and\\r\\n     he that sat thereon, called Faithful and True; and in\\r\\n     righteousness he doth judge and make war. And his eyes are a\\r\\n     flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems; and he hath\\r\\n     a name written, which no one knoweth but he himself. And he is\\r\\n     arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood: and his name is\\r\\n     called The Word of God.\"[106:14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIs this all rhapsody, or is it in part true report? There is evidently\\r\\nno answer to the question so conceived. But if it were to express my own\\r\\nreligious feeling it would have some specific proportion of literal and\\r\\nmetaphorical significance, according to the degree to which its detail\\r\\ncontributes different practical values to me. It might then be my\\r\\nguide-book to the heavens, or only my testimony to the dignity and\\r\\nmystery of the function of Christ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of religion bears in a very important way upon this last\\r\\nproblem. The factor of imagination has undoubtedly come to have a more\\r\\nclearly recognized role in religion. There can be no doubt that what we\\r\\nnow call myths were once beliefs, and that what we now call poetry was\\r\\nonce history. If we go back sufficiently far we come to a time when the\\r\\nliteral and the metaphorical were scarcely distinguishable, and this\\r\\nbecause science had not emerged from the early animistic extension of\\r\\nsocial relations. Men _meant_ to address their gods as they addressed\\r\\ntheir fellows, and expected them to hear and respond, as they looked for\\r\\nsuch reactions within the narrower circle of ordinary intercourse. The\\r\\nadvance of science has brought into vogue a description of nature that\\r\\ninhibits such expectations. The result has been that men, continuing to\\r\\nuse the same terms, essentially expressive as they are of a practical\\r\\nrelationship, have come to regard them as only a general expression of\\r\\ntheir attitude. The differences of content that are in excess of factors\\r\\nof expectation remain as poetry and myth. On the other hand, it is\\r\\nequally possible, if not equally common, for that which was once\\r\\nimagined to come to be believed. Such a transformation is, perhaps,\\r\\nnormally the case when the inspired utterance passes from its author to\\r\\nthe cult. The prophets and sweet singers are likely to possess an\\r\\nexuberance of imagination not appreciated by their followers; and for\\r\\nthis reason almost certainly misunderstood. For these reasons it is\\r\\nmanifestly absurd to fasten the name of myth or the name of creed upon\\r\\nany religious utterance whatsoever, unless it be so regarded from the\\r\\nstand-point of the personal religion which it originally expressed, or\\r\\nunless one means by so doing to define it as an expression of his own\\r\\nreligion. He who defines \"the myth of creation,\" or \"the poetical story\\r\\nof Samson,\" as parts of the pre-Christian Judaic religion, exhibits a\\r\\ntotal loss of historical sense. The distinction between cognition and\\r\\nfancy does not exist among objects, but only in the _intending_\\r\\nexperience; hence, for me to attach my own distinction to any individual\\r\\ncase of belief, viewed apart from the believer, is an utterly confusing\\r\\nprojection of my own personality into the field of my study.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Philosophy Implied in Religion and in Religions.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 38. Only after such considerations as these are we qualified to attack\\r\\nthat much-vexed question as to whether religion deals invariably with a\\r\\npersonal god. It is often assumed in discussion of this question that\\r\\n\"personal god,\" as well as \"god,\" is a distinct and familiar kind of\\r\\nentity, like a dragon or centaur; its existence alone being\\r\\nproblematical. This is doubly false to the religious employment of such\\r\\nan object. If it be true that in religion we mean by God a practical\\r\\ninterpretation of the world, _whatsoever be its nature_, then the\\r\\npersonality of God must be a derivative of the attitude, and not of the\\r\\nnature of the world. Given the practical outlook upon life, there is no\\r\\ndefinable world that cannot be construed under the form of God. My god\\r\\nis my world practically recognized in respect of its fundamental or\\r\\nultimate attitude to my ideals. In the sense, then, conveyed by this\\r\\nterm _attitude_ my god will invariably possess the characters of\\r\\npersonality. But the degree to which these characters will coincide with\\r\\nthe characters which I assign to human persons, or the terms of any\\r\\nlogical conception of personality, cannot be absolutely defined.\\r\\nAnthropomorphisms may be imagination or they may be literal conviction.\\r\\nThis will depend, as above maintained, upon the degree to which they\\r\\ndetermine my expectations. Suppose the world to be theoretically\\r\\nconceived as governed by laws that are indifferent to all human\\r\\ninterests. The practical expression of this conception appears in the\\r\\nnaturalism of Lucretius, or Diogenes, or Omar Khayyam. Living in the\\r\\nvivid presence of an indifferent world, I may picture my gods as leading\\r\\ntheir own lives in some remote realm which is inaccessible to my\\r\\npetitions, or as regarding me with sinister and contemptuous cruelty. In\\r\\nthe latter case I may shrink and cower, or return them contempt for\\r\\ncontempt. I mean this literally only if I look for consequences\\r\\nfollowing directly from the emotional coloring which I have bestowed\\r\\nupon them. It may well be that I mean merely to regard myself _sub\\r\\nspecie eternitatis_, in which case I am _personifying_ in the sense of\\r\\nfree imagination. In the religion of enlightenment the divine attitude\\r\\ntends to belong to the poetry and eloquence of religion rather than to\\r\\nits cognitive intent. This is true even of optimistic and idealistic\\r\\nreligion. The love and providence of God are less commonly supposed to\\r\\nwarrant an expectation of special and arbitrary favors, and have come\\r\\nmore and more to mean the play of my own feeling about the general\\r\\ncentral conviction of the favorableness of the cosmos to my deeper or\\r\\nmoral concerns. But the factor of personality cannot possibly be\\r\\nentirely eliminated, for the religious consciousness _creates_ a social\\r\\nrelationship between man and the universe. Such an interpretation of\\r\\nlife is not a case of the pathetic fallacy, unless it incorrectly\\r\\n_reckons with_ the inner feeling which it attributes to the universe. It\\r\\nis an obvious practical truth that the total or residual environment is\\r\\nsignificant for life. Grant this and you make rational a recognition of\\r\\nthat significance, or a more or less constant sense of coincidence or\\r\\nconflict with cosmical forces. Permit this consciousness to stand, and\\r\\nyou make some expression of it inevitable. Such an expression may,\\r\\nfurthermore, with perfect propriety and in fulfilment of human nature,\\r\\nset forth and transfigure this central belief until it may enter into\\r\\nthe context of immediacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus any conception of the universe whatsoever may afford a basis for\\r\\nreligion. But there is no religion that does not virtually make a more\\r\\ndefinite claim upon the nature of things, and this entirely\\r\\nindependently of its theology, or explicit attempt to define itself.\\r\\nEvery religion, even in the very living of it, is naturalistic, or\\r\\ndualistic, or pluralistic, or optimistic, or idealistic, or pessimistic.\\r\\nAnd there is in the realm of truth that which justifies or refutes these\\r\\ndefinite practical ways of construing the universe. But no historical\\r\\nreligion is ever so vague even as this in its philosophical\\r\\nimplications. Indeed, we shall always be brought eventually to the\\r\\ninner meaning of some individual religious experience, where no general\\r\\ncriticism can be certainly valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, then, a place in religion for that which is not directly\\r\\nanswerable to philosophical or scientific standards. But there is\\r\\nalways, on the other hand, an element of hope which conceives the nature\\r\\nof the world, and means to be grounded in reality. In respect of that\\r\\nelement, philosophy is indispensable to religion. The meaning of\\r\\nreligion is, in fact, the central problem of philosophy. There is a\\r\\nvirtue in religion like that which Emerson ascribes to poetry. \"The poet\\r\\nis in the right attitude; he is believing; the philosopher, after some\\r\\nstruggle, having only reasons for believing.\" But whatever may be said\\r\\nto the disparagement of its dialectic, philosophy is the justification\\r\\nof religion, and the criticism of religions. To it must be assigned the\\r\\ntask of so refining positive religion as to contribute to the perpetual\\r\\nestablishment of true religion. And to philosophy, with religion,\\r\\nbelongs the task of holding fast to the idea of the universe. There is\\r\\nno religion except before you begin, or after you have rested from, your\\r\\nphilosophical speculation. But in the universe these interests have a\\r\\ncommon object. As philosophy is the articulation and vindication of\\r\\nreligion, so is religion the realization of philosophy. In philosophy\\r\\nthought is brought up to the elevation of life, and in religion\\r\\nphilosophy, as the sum of wisdom, enters into life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[83:1] As Plato interprets the scepticism of Protagoras to mean that one\\r\\nstate of mind cannot be more _true_ than another, but only _better_ or\\r\\nworse.

Misconceptions\\r\\nand Antagonisms.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 39. In the case of natural science we meet not only with a special\\r\\nhuman interest, but with a theoretical discipline. We are confronted,\\r\\ntherefore, with a new question: that of the relation within the body of\\r\\nhuman knowledge of two of its constituent members. Owing to the militant\\r\\ntemper of the representatives of both science and philosophy, this has\\r\\nlong since ceased to be an academic question, and has frequently been\\r\\nmet in the spirit of rivalry and partisanship. But the true order of\\r\\nknowledge is only temporarily distorted by the brilliant success of a\\r\\nspecial type of investigation; and the conquests of science are now so\\r\\nold a story that critical thought shows a disposition to judge of the\\r\\nissue with sobriety and logical highmindedness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the seventeenth century a newly emancipated and too sanguine reason\\r\\nproposed to know the whole of nature at once in terms of mathematics\\r\\nand mechanics. Thus the system of the Englishman Hobbes was science\\r\\nswelled to world-proportions, simple, compact, conclusive, and\\r\\nall-comprehensive. Philosophy proposed to do the work of science, but in\\r\\nits own grand manner. The last twenty years of Hobbes\\'s life, spent in\\r\\nrepeated discomfiture at the hands of Seth Ward, Wallis, Boyle, and\\r\\nother scientific experts of the new Royal Society, certified\\r\\nconclusively to the failure of this enterprise, and the experimental\\r\\nspecialist thereupon took exclusive possession of the field of natural\\r\\nlaw. But the idealist, on the other hand, reconstructed nature to meet\\r\\nthe demands of philosophical knowledge and religious faith. There\\r\\nissued, together with little mutual understanding and less sympathy, on\\r\\nthe one hand _positivism_, or exclusive experimentalism, and on the\\r\\nother hand a rabid and unsympathetic transcendentalism. Hume, who\\r\\nconsigned to the flames all thought save \"abstract reasoning concerning\\r\\nquantity or number,\" and \"experimental reasoning concerning matter of\\r\\nfact and existence\"; Comte, who assigned metaphysics to an immature\\r\\nstage in the development of human intelligence; and Tyndall, who reduced\\r\\nthe religious consciousness to an emotional experience of mystery, are\\r\\ntypical of the one attitude. The other is well exhibited in Schelling\\'s\\r\\nreference to \"the blind and thoughtless mode of investigating nature\\r\\nwhich has become generally established since the corruption of\\r\\nphilosophy by Bacon, and of physics by Boyle.\" Dogmatic experimentalism\\r\\nand dogmatic idealism signify more or less consistently the abstract\\r\\nisolation of the scientific and philosophical motives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is already a touch of quaintness in both of these attitudes. We of\\r\\nthe present are in the habit of acknowledging the autonomy of science,\\r\\nand the unimpeachable validity of the results of experimental research\\r\\nin so far as they are sanctioned by the consensus of experts. But at the\\r\\nsame time we recognize the definiteness of the task of science, and the\\r\\nvalidity of such reservations as may be made from a higher critical\\r\\npoint of view. Science is to be transcended in so far as it is\\r\\nunderstood as a whole. Philosophy is critically empirical; empirical,\\r\\nbecause it regards all _bona fide_ descriptions of experience as\\r\\nknowledge; critical, because attentive to the conditions of both general\\r\\nand special knowledge. And in terms of a critical empiricism so defined,\\r\\nit is one of the problems of philosophy _to define and appraise the\\r\\ngenerating problem of science_, and so to determine the value\\r\\nassignable to natural laws in the whole system of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Spheres of Philosophy and Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 40. If this be the true function of philosophy with reference to\\r\\nscience, several current notions of the relations of the spheres of\\r\\nthese disciplines may be disproved. In the first place, philosophy will\\r\\nnot be all the sciences regarded as one science. Science tends to unify\\r\\nwithout any higher criticism. The various sciences already regard the\\r\\none nature as their common object, and the one system of interdependent\\r\\nlaws as their common achievement. The philosopher who tries to be all\\r\\nscience at once fails ignominiously because he tries to replace the work\\r\\nof a specialist with the work of a dilettante; and if philosophy be\\r\\nidentical with that body of truth accumulated and organized by the\\r\\nco\\xc3\\xb6perative activity of scientific men, then philosophy is a name and\\r\\nthere is no occasion for the existence of the philosopher as such.\\r\\nSecondly, philosophy will not be the assembling of the sciences; for\\r\\nsuch would be a merely clerical work, and the philosopher would much\\r\\nbetter be regarded as non-existent than as a book-keeper. Nor, thirdly,\\r\\nis philosophy an auxiliary discipline that may be called upon in\\r\\nemergencies for the solution of some baffling problem of science. A\\r\\nproblem defined by science must be solved in the scientific manner.\\r\\nScience will accept no aid from the gods when engaged in her own\\r\\ncampaign, but will fight it out according to her own principles of\\r\\nwarfare. And as long as science moves in her own plane, she can\\r\\nacknowledge no permanent barriers. There is then no need of any\\r\\nsuperscientific research that shall replace, or piece together, or\\r\\nextend the work of science. But the savant is not on this account in\\r\\npossession of the entire field of knowledge. It is true that he is not\\r\\ninfrequently moved to such a conviction when he takes us about to view\\r\\nhis estates. Together we ascend up into heaven, or make our beds in\\r\\nsheol, or take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts\\r\\nof the sea--and look in vain for anything that is not work done, or work\\r\\nprojected, by natural science. Persuade him, however, to _define_ his\\r\\nestates, and he has circumscribed them. In his definition he must employ\\r\\nconceptions more fundamental than the working conceptions that he\\r\\nemploys within his field of study. Indeed, in viewing his task as\\r\\ndefinite and specific he has undertaken the solution of the problem of\\r\\nphilosophy. The logical self-consciousness has been awakened, and there\\r\\nis no honorable way of putting it to sleep again. This is precisely\\r\\nwhat takes place in any account of the generating problem of science. To\\r\\ndefine science is to define at least one realm that is other than\\r\\nscience, the realm of active intellectual endeavor with its own proper\\r\\ncategories. One cannot reflect upon science and assign it an end, and a\\r\\nmethod proper to that end, without bringing into the field of knowledge\\r\\na broader field of experience than the field proper to science, broader\\r\\nat any rate by the presence in it of the scientific activity itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, is the field proper to philosophy. The scientist _qua_\\r\\nscientist is intent upon his own determinate enterprise. The philosopher\\r\\ncomes into being as one who is interested in observing what it is that\\r\\nthe scientist is so intently doing. In taking this interest he has\\r\\naccepted as a field for investigation that which he would designate as\\r\\nthe totality of interests or the inclusive experience. He can carry out\\r\\nhis intention of defining the scientific attitude only by standing\\r\\noutside it, and determining it by means of nothing less than an\\r\\nexhaustive searching out of all attitudes. Philosophy is, to be sure,\\r\\nitself a definite activity and an attitude, but an attitude required by\\r\\ndefinition to be conscious of itself, and, if you please, conscious of\\r\\nits own consciousness, until its attitude shall have embraced in its\\r\\nobject the very principle of attitudes. Philosophy defines itself and\\r\\nall other human tasks and interests. None have furnished a clearer\\r\\njustification of philosophy than those men of scientific predilections\\r\\nwho have claimed the title of agnostics. A good instance is furnished by\\r\\na contemporary physicist, who has chosen to call his reflections\\r\\n\"antimetaphysical.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Physical science does not pretend to be a _complete_ view of\\r\\n     the world; it simply claims that it is working toward such a\\r\\n     complete view in the future. The highest philosophy of the\\r\\n     scientific investigator is precisely this _toleration_ of an\\r\\n     incomplete conception of the world and the preference for it,\\r\\n     rather than an apparently perfect, but inadequate\\r\\n     conception.\"[120:1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is apparent that if one were to challenge such a statement, the issue\\r\\nraised would at once be philosophical and not scientific. The problem\\r\\nhere stated and answered, requires for its solution the widest\\r\\ninclusiveness of view, and a peculiar interest in critical reflection\\r\\nand logical co\\xc3\\xb6rdination.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Procedure of a Philosophy of Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 41. One may be prepared for a knowledge of the economic and social\\r\\nsignificance of the railway even if one does not know a throttle from a\\r\\npiston-rod, provided one has broad and well-balanced knowledge of the\\r\\ninterplay of human social interests. One\\'s proficiency here requires one\\r\\nto stand off from society, and to obtain a perspective that shall be as\\r\\nlittle distorted as possible. The reflection of the philosopher of\\r\\nscience requires a similar quality of perspective. All knowledges,\\r\\ntogether with the knowing of them, must be his object yonder, standing\\r\\napart in its wholeness and symmetry. Philosophy is the least dogmatic,\\r\\nthe most empirical, of all disciplines, since it is the only\\r\\ninvestigation that can permit itself to be forgetful of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the most comprehensive view may be the most distorted and false. The\\r\\ntrue order of knowledge is the difficult task of logical analysis,\\r\\nrequiring as its chief essential some determination of the scope of the\\r\\nworking conceptions of the different independent branches of knowledge.\\r\\nIn the case of natural science this would mean an examination of the\\r\\nmethod and results characteristic of this field, for the sake of\\r\\ndefining the kind of truth which attaches to the laws which are being\\r\\ngradually formulated. But one must immediately reach either the one or\\r\\nthe other of two very general conclusions. If the laws of natural\\r\\nscience cover all possible knowledge of reality, then there is left to\\r\\nphilosophy only the logical function of justifying this statement. Logic\\r\\nand natural science will then constitute the sum of knowledge. If, on\\r\\nthe other hand, it be found that the aim of natural science is such as\\r\\nto exclude certain aspects of reality, then philosophy will not be\\r\\nrestricted to logical criticism, but will have a cognitive field of its\\r\\nown. The great majority of philosophers have assumed the latter of these\\r\\nalternatives to be true, while most aggressive scientists have intended\\r\\nthe former in their somewhat blind attacks upon \"metaphysics.\" Although\\r\\nthe selection of either of these alternatives involves us in the defence\\r\\nof a specific answer to a philosophical question, the issue is\\r\\ninevitable in any introduction to philosophy because of its bearing upon\\r\\nthe extent of the field of that study. Furthermore there can be no\\r\\nbetter exposition of the meaning of philosophy of science than an\\r\\nillustration of its exercise. The following, then, is to be regarded as\\r\\non the one hand a tentative refutation of _positivism_, or the _claim of\\r\\nnatural science to be coextensive with knowable reality_; and on the\\r\\nother hand a programme for the procedure of philosophy with reference\\r\\nto natural science.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Origin of the Scientific Interest.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 42. Science issues through imperceptible stages from organic habits\\r\\nand instincts which signify the possession by living creatures of a\\r\\npower to meet the environment on its own terms. Every organism possesses\\r\\nsuch a working knowledge of nature, and among men the first science\\r\\nconsists in those habitual adjustments common to men and infra-human\\r\\norganisms. Man is already practising science before he recognizes it. As\\r\\n_skill_ it distinguishes itself early in his history from lore, or\\r\\nuntested tradition. Skill is familiarity with general kinds of events,\\r\\ntogether with ability to identify an individual with reference to a\\r\\nkind, and so be prepared for the outcome. Thus man is inwardly prepared\\r\\nfor the alternation of day and night, and the periods of the seasons. He\\r\\npractically anticipates the procession of natural events in the\\r\\ncountless emergencies of his daily life. But science in the stricter\\r\\nsense begins when skill becomes _free_ and _social_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Skill as Free.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 43. Skill may be said to be _free_ when the essential terms of the\\r\\naction have been abstracted from the circumstances attending them in\\r\\nindividual experiences, and are retained as ideal plans applicable to\\r\\nany practical occasion. The monkey who swings with a trapeze from his\\r\\nperch on the side of the cage, counts upon swinging back again without\\r\\nany further effort on his own part. His act and its successful issue\\r\\nsignify his practical familiarity with the natural motions of bodies. We\\r\\ncan conceive such a performance to be accompanied by an almost entire\\r\\nfailure to grasp its essentials. It would then be necessary for nearly\\r\\nthe whole situation to be repeated in order to induce in the monkey the\\r\\nsame action and expectation. He would require a similar form, color, and\\r\\ndistance. But he might, on the other hand, regard as practically\\r\\nidentical all suspended and freely swinging bodies capable of affording\\r\\nhim support, and quite independently of their shape, size, time, or\\r\\nplace. In this latter case his skill would be applicable to the widest\\r\\npossible number of cases that could present themselves. Having a\\r\\ndiscerning eye for essentials, he would lose no chance of a swing\\r\\nthrough looking for more than the bare necessities. When the\\r\\nphysicist describes the pendulum in terms of a formula such as\\r\\nt = 2pi[squareroot(l/g)] he exhibits a similar discernment. He has\\r\\nfound that the time occupied by an oscillation of any pendulum may be\\r\\ncalculated exclusively in terms of its length and the acceleration due\\r\\nto gravity. The monkey\\'s higher proficiency and the formula alike\\r\\nrepresent a knowledge that is free in the sense that it is contained in\\r\\nterms that require no single fixed context in immediacy. The knowledge\\r\\nis valid wherever these essential terms are present; and calculations\\r\\nmay be based upon these essential terms, while attendant circumstances\\r\\nvary _ad infinitum_. Such knowledge is said to be _general_ or\\r\\n_universal_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another element of freedom, however, which so far has not been\\r\\nattributed to the monkey\\'s knowledge, but which is evidently present in\\r\\nthat of the physicist. The former has a practical ability to deal with a\\r\\npendulum when he sees it. The latter, on the other hand, knows about a\\r\\npendulum whether one be present or not. His knowledge is so retained as\\r\\nalways to be available, even though it be not always applicable. His\\r\\nknowledge is not merely skill in treating a situation, but the\\r\\npossession of resources which he may employ at whatever time, and in\\r\\nwhatever manner, may suit his interests. Knowing what he does about the\\r\\npendulum, he may act from the idea of such a contrivance, and with the\\r\\naid of it construct some more complex mechanism. His formulas are his\\r\\ninstruments, which he may use on any occasion. Suppose that a situation\\r\\nwith factors _a_, _b_, and _c_ requires factor _d_ in order to become\\r\\n_M_, as desired. Such a situation might easily be hopeless for an\\r\\norganism reacting directly to the stimulus _abc_, and yet be easily met\\r\\nby a free knowledge of _d_. One who knows that _l_, _m_, and _n_ will\\r\\nproduce _d_, may by these means provide the missing factor, complete the\\r\\nsum of required conditions, _abcd_, and so obtain the end _M_. Such\\r\\nindirection might be used to obtain any required factor of the end, or\\r\\nof any near or remote means to the end. There is, in fact, no limit to\\r\\nthe complexity of action made possible upon this basis; for since it is\\r\\navailable in idea, the whole range of such knowledge may be brought to\\r\\nbear upon any individual problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Skill as Social.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 44. But knowledge of this free type becomes at the same time _social_\\r\\nor _institutional_. It consists no longer in a skilful adaptation of the\\r\\nindividual organism, but in a system of terms common to all\\r\\nintelligence, and preserved in those books and other monuments which\\r\\nserve as the articulate memory of the race. A knowledge that is social\\r\\nmust be composed of unequivocal conceptions and fixed symbols. The\\r\\nmathematical laws of the exact sciences represent the most successful\\r\\nattainment of this end so far as form is concerned. Furthermore, the\\r\\namount of knowledge may now be increased from generation to generation\\r\\nthrough the service of those who make a vocation of its pursuit. Natural\\r\\nscience is thus a cumulative racial proficiency, which any individual\\r\\nmay bring to bear upon any emergency of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Science for Accommodation and Construction.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 45. Such proficiency as science affords is in every case the\\r\\nanticipation of experience. This has a twofold value for mankind, that\\r\\nof _accommodation_, and that of _construction_. Primitively, where mere\\r\\nsurvival is the function of the organism as a whole, the value of\\r\\naccommodation is relatively fundamental. The knowledge of what may be\\r\\nexpected enables the organism to save itself by means of its own\\r\\ncounter-arrangement of natural processes. Construction is here for the\\r\\nsake of accommodation. But with the growth of civilization construction\\r\\nbecomes a positive interest, and man tends to save himself for definite\\r\\nends. Accommodation comes to take place for the sake of construction.\\r\\nScience then supplies the individual with the ways and means wherewith\\r\\nto execute life purposes which themselves tend to assume an absolute\\r\\nvalue that cannot be justified merely on the ground of science.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Method and Fundamental Conceptions of Natural Science. The\\r\\nDescriptive Method.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 46. If natural science be animated by any special cognitive interest,\\r\\nthis motive should appear in the development of its method and\\r\\nfundamental conceptions. If that interest has been truly defined, it\\r\\nshould now enable us to understand the progressive and permanent in\\r\\nscientific investigation as directly related to it. For the aim of any\\r\\ndiscipline exercises a gradual selection from among possible methods,\\r\\nand gives to its laws their determinate and final form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _descriptive method_ is at the present day fully established. A\\r\\nleading moral of the history of science is the superior usefulness of an\\r\\nexact account of the workings of nature to an explanation in terms of\\r\\nsome qualitative potency. Explanation has been postponed by enlightened\\r\\nscience until after a more careful observation of actual processes shall\\r\\nhave been made; and at length it has been admitted that there is no need\\r\\nof any explanation but perfect description. Now the practical use of\\r\\nscience defined above, requires no knowledge beyond the actual order of\\r\\nevents. For such a purpose sufficient reason signifies only sufficient\\r\\nconditions. All other considerations are irrelevant, and it is proper\\r\\nto ignore them. Such has actually been the fate of the so-called\\r\\nmetaphysical solution of special problems of nature. The case of Kepler\\r\\nis the classic instance. This great scientist supplemented his laws of\\r\\nplanetary motion with the following speculation concerning the agencies\\r\\nat work:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We must suppose one of two things: either that the moving\\r\\n     spirits, in proportion as they are more removed from the sun,\\r\\n     are more feeble; or that there is one moving spirit in the\\r\\n     centre of all the orbits, namely, in the sun, which urges each\\r\\n     body the more vehemently in proportion as it is nearer; but in\\r\\n     more distant spaces languishes in consequence of the\\r\\n     remoteness and attenuation of its virtue.\"[129:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following passage from Hegel affords an interesting analogy:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The moon is the waterless crystal which seeks to complete\\r\\n     itself by means of our sea, to quench the thirst of its arid\\r\\n     rigidity, and therefore produces ebb and flow.\"[129:3]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo scientist has ever sought to refute either of these theories. They\\r\\nhave merely been neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were advanced in obedience to a demand for the ultimate\\r\\nexplanation of the phenomena in question, and were obtained by applying\\r\\nsuch general conceptions as were most satisfying to the reasons of their\\r\\nrespective authors. But they contributed nothing whatsoever to a\\r\\npractical familiarity with the natural course of events, in this case\\r\\nthe times and places of the planets and the tides. Hence they have not\\r\\nbeen used in the building of science. In our own day investigators have\\r\\nbecome conscious of their motive, and do not wait for historical\\r\\nselection to exclude powers and reasons from their province. They\\r\\ndeliberately seek to formulate exact descriptions. To this end they\\r\\nemploy symbols that shall serve to identify the terms of nature, and\\r\\nformulas that shall define their systematic relationship. These systems\\r\\nmust be exact, or deductions cannot be made from them. Hence they tend\\r\\nultimately to assume a mathematical form of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Space, Time, and Prediction.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 47. But science tends to employ for these systems only such\\r\\nconceptions as relate to _prediction_; and of these the most fundamental\\r\\nare _space_ and _time_. The first science to establish its method was\\r\\nthe science of astronomy, where measurement and computation in terms of\\r\\nspace and time were the most obvious means of description; and the\\r\\ngeneral application of the method of astronomy by Galileo and Newton, or\\r\\nthe development of mechanics, is the most important factor in the\\r\\nestablishment of modern science upon a permanent working basis. The\\r\\npersistence of the term _cause_, testifies to the fact that science is\\r\\nprimarily concerned with the determination of _events_. Its definitions\\r\\nof objects are means of identification, while its laws are dynamical,\\r\\n_i. e._, have reference to the conditions under which these objects\\r\\narise. Thus the chemist may know less about the properties of water than\\r\\nthe poet; but he is pre\\xc3\\xabminently skilled in its production from\\r\\nelements, and understands similarly the compounds into which it may\\r\\nenter. Now the general conditions of all anticipation, whereby it\\r\\nbecomes exact and verifiable, are spacial and temporal. A predictable\\r\\nevent must be assigned to what is here now, or there now; or what is\\r\\nhere then, or there then. An experimentally verifiable system must\\r\\ncontain space-time variables, for which can be substituted the here and\\r\\nnow of the experimenter\\'s immediate experience. Hence science deals\\r\\nprimarily with calculable places and moments. The mechanical theory of\\r\\nnature owes its success to a union of space and time through its\\r\\nconceptions of _matter_ and _motion_.[132:4] And the projected theory of\\r\\nenergetics must satisfy the same conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Quantitative Method.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 48. But, furthermore, science has, as we have seen, an interest in\\r\\nfreeing its descriptions from the peculiar angle and relativity of an\\r\\nindividual\\'s experience, for the sake of affording him knowledge of that\\r\\nwith which he must meet. Science enlightens the will by acquainting it\\r\\nwith that which takes place in spite of it, and for which it must hold\\r\\nitself in readiness. To this end the individual benefits himself in so\\r\\nfar as he eliminates himself from the objects which he investigates. His\\r\\nknowledge is useful in so far as it is valid for his own indefinitely\\r\\nvarying stand-points, and those of other wills recognized by him in his\\r\\npractical relations. But in attempting to describe objects in terms\\r\\nother than those of a specific experience, science is compelled to\\r\\ndescribe them in terms of one another. For this purpose _the\\r\\nquantitative method_ is peculiarly serviceable. With its aid objects\\r\\npermit themselves to be described as multiples of one another, and as\\r\\noccupying positions in relation to one another. When all objects are\\r\\ndescribed strictly in terms of one another, they are expressed in terms\\r\\nof arbitrary units, and located in terms of arbitrary spacial or\\r\\ntemporal axes of reference. Thus there arises the universe of the\\r\\nscientific imagination, a vast complexity of material displacements and\\r\\ntransformations, without color, music, pleasure, or any of all that rich\\r\\nvariety of qualities that the least of human experiences contains. It\\r\\ndoes not completely rationalize or even completely describe such\\r\\nexperiences, but formulates their succession. To this end they are\\r\\nreduced to terms that correspond to no specific experience, and for this\\r\\nvery reason may be translated again into all definable hypothetical\\r\\nexperiences. The solar system for astronomy is not a bird\\'s-eye view of\\r\\nelliptical orbits, with the planets and satellites in definite phases.\\r\\nNor is it this group of objects from any such point of view, or from any\\r\\nnumber of such points of view; but a formulation of their motions that\\r\\nwill serve as the key to an infinite number of their appearances. Or,\\r\\nconsider the picture of the ichthysauria romping in the mesozoic sea,\\r\\nthat commonly accompanies a text-book of geology. Any such picture, and\\r\\nall such pictures, with their coloring and their temporal and spacial\\r\\nperspective, are imaginary. No such special and exclusive manifolds can\\r\\nbe defined as having been then and there realized. But we have a\\r\\ngeological knowledge of this period, that fulfils the formal demands of\\r\\nnatural science, in so far as we can construct this and countless other\\r\\nspecific experiences with reference to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The General Development of Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 49. Science, then, is to be understood as springing from the practical\\r\\nnecessity of anticipating the environment. This anticipation appears\\r\\nfirst as congenital or acquired reactions on the part of the organism.\\r\\nSuch reactions imply a fixed co\\xc3\\xb6rdination or system in the environment\\r\\nwhereby a given circumstance determines other circumstances; and science\\r\\nproper arises as the formulation of such systems. The requirement that\\r\\nthey shall apply to the phenomena that _confront_ the will, determines\\r\\ntheir spacial, temporal, and quantitative form. The progress of science\\r\\nis marked by the growth of these conceptions in the direction of\\r\\ncomprehensiveness on the one hand, and of refinement and delicacy on the\\r\\nother. Man lives in an environment that is growing at the same time\\r\\nricher and more extended, but with a compensatory simplification in the\\r\\never closer systematization of scientific conceptions under the form of\\r\\nthe order of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Determination of the Limits of Natural Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 50. At the opening of this chapter it was maintained that it is a\\r\\nfunction of philosophy to criticise science through its generating\\r\\nproblem, or its self-imposed task viewed as determining its province and\\r\\nselecting its categories. The above account of the origin and method of\\r\\nscience must suffice as a definition of its generating problem, and\\r\\nafford the basis of our answer to the question of its limits. Enough has\\r\\nbeen said to make it clear that philosophy is not in the field of\\r\\nscience, and is therefore not entitled to contest its result in detail\\r\\nor even to take sides within the province of its special problems.\\r\\nFurthermore, philosophy should not aim to restrain science by the\\r\\nimposition of external barriers. Whatever may be said of the sufficiency\\r\\nof its categories in any region of the world, that body of truth of\\r\\nwhich mathematics, mechanics, and physics are the foundations, must be\\r\\nregarded as a whole that tends to be all-comprehensive in its own terms.\\r\\nThere remains for philosophy, then, the critical examination of these\\r\\nterms, and the appraisal as a whole of the truth that they may express.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Natural Science is Abstract.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 51. The impossibility of embracing the whole of knowledge within\\r\\nnatural science is due to the fact that the latter is _abstract_. This\\r\\nfollows from the fact that natural science is governed by a selective\\r\\ninterest. The formulation of definitions and laws in exclusively\\r\\nmechanical terms is not due to the exhaustive or even pre\\xc3\\xabminent reality\\r\\nof these properties, but to their peculiar serviceableness in a\\r\\nverifiable description of events. Natural science does not affirm that\\r\\nreality is essentially constituted of matter, or essentially\\r\\ncharacterized by motion; but is _interested_ in the mechanical aspect of\\r\\nreality, and describes it quite regardless of other evident aspects and\\r\\nwithout meaning to prejudice them. It is unfortunately true that the\\r\\nscientist has rarely been clear in his own mind on this point. It is\\r\\nonly recently that he has partially freed himself from the habit of\\r\\nconstruing his terms as final and exhaustive.[137:5] This he was able\\r\\nto do even to his own satisfaction, only by allowing loose rein to the\\r\\nimagination. Consider the example of the atomic theory. In order to\\r\\ndescribe such occurrences as chemical combination, or changes in volume\\r\\nand density, the scientist has employed as a unit the least particle,\\r\\nphysically indivisible and qualitatively homogeneous. Look for the atom\\r\\nin the body of science, and you will find it in physical laws governing\\r\\nexpansion and contraction, and in chemical formulas. There the real\\r\\nresponsibility of science ends. But whether through the need of popular\\r\\nexposition, or the undisciplined imagination of the investigator\\r\\nhimself, atoms have figured in the history of thought as round\\r\\ncorpuscles of a grayish hue scurrying hither and thither, and armed with\\r\\nspecial appliances wherewith to lock in molecular embrace. Although this\\r\\nis nonsense, we need not on that account conclude that there are no\\r\\natoms. There are atoms in precisely the sense intended by scientific\\r\\nlaw, in that the formulas computed with the aid of this concept are true\\r\\nof certain natural processes. The conception of ether furnishes a\\r\\nsimilar case. Science is not responsible for the notion of a quivering\\r\\ngelatinous substance pervading space, but only for certain laws that,\\r\\n_e. g._, describe the velocity of light in terms of the vibration. It is\\r\\ntrue that there is such a thing as ether, not as gratuitously rounded\\r\\nout by the imagination, with various attributes of immediate experience,\\r\\nbut just in so far as this concept is employed in verified descriptions\\r\\nof radiation, magnetism, or electricity. Strictly speaking science\\r\\nasserts nothing about the existence of ether, but only about the\\r\\nbehavior, _e. g._, of light. If true descriptions of this and other\\r\\nphenomena are reached by employing units of wave propagation in an\\r\\nelastic medium, then ether is proved to exist in precisely the same\\r\\nsense that linear feet are proved to exist, if it be admitted that there\\r\\nare 90,000,000 x 5,280 of them between the earth and the sun. And to\\r\\nimagine in the one case a jelly with all the qualities of texture,\\r\\ncolor, and the like, that an individual object of sense would possess,\\r\\nis much the same as in the other to imagine the heavens filled with\\r\\nfoot-rules and tape-measures. There is but one safe procedure in dealing\\r\\nwith scientific concepts: to regard them as true so far as they\\r\\ndescribe, and no whit further. To supplement the strict meaning which\\r\\nhas been verified and is contained in the formularies of science, with\\r\\nsuch vague predicates as will suffice to make entities of them, is mere\\r\\nineptness and confusion of thought. And it is only such a\\r\\nsupplementation that obscures their abstractness. For a mechanical\\r\\ndescription of things, true as it doubtless is, is even more indubitably\\r\\nincomplete.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Meaning of Abstractness in Truth.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 52. But though the abstractness involved in scientific description is\\r\\nopen and deliberate, we must come to a more precise understanding of it,\\r\\nif we are to draw any conclusion as to what it involves. In his\\r\\n\"Principles of Human Knowledge,\" the English philosopher Bishop Berkeley\\r\\nraises the question as to the universal validity of mathematical\\r\\ndemonstrations. If we prove from the image or figure of an isosceles\\r\\nright triangle that the sum of its angles is equal to two right angles,\\r\\nhow can we know that this proposition holds of all triangles?\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"To which I answer, that, though the idea I have in view\\r\\n     whilst I make the demonstration be, for instance, that of an\\r\\n     isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a\\r\\n     determinate length, I may nevertheless be certain it extends\\r\\n     to all other rectilinear triangles, of what sort or bigness\\r\\n     soever. And that because neither the right angle, nor the\\r\\n     equality, nor determinate length of the sides are at all\\r\\n     concerned in the demonstration. It is true the diagram I have\\r\\n     in view includes all these particulars; but then there is not\\r\\n     the least mention made of them in the proof of the\\r\\n     proposition.\"[140:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the total conditions present in the concrete picture of a triangle,\\r\\none may in one\\'s calculations neglect as many as one sees fit, and work\\r\\nwith the remainder. Then, if one has clearly distinguished the\\r\\nconditions used, one may confidently assert that whatever has been found\\r\\ntrue of them holds regardless of the neglected conditions. These may be\\r\\nmissing or replaced by others, provided the selected or (for any given\\r\\ninvestigation) essential conditions are not affected. That which is true\\r\\nonce is true always, provided time is not one of its conditions; that\\r\\nwhich is true in one place is true everywhere, provided location is not\\r\\none of its conditions. But, given any concrete situation, the more\\r\\nnumerous the conditions one ignores in one\\'s calculations, the less\\r\\nadequate are one\\'s calculations to that situation. The number of its\\r\\ninhabitants, and any mathematical operation made with that number, is\\r\\ntrue, but only very abstractly true of a nation. A similar though less\\r\\nradical abstractness appertains to natural science. Simple qualities of\\r\\nsound or color, and distinctions of beauty or moral worth, together with\\r\\nmany other ingredients of actual experience attributed therein to the\\r\\nobjects of nature, are ignored in the mechanical scheme. There is a\\r\\nsubstitution of certain mechanical arrangements in the case of the first\\r\\ngroup of properties, the simple qualities of sense, so that they may be\\r\\nassimilated to the general scheme of events, and their occurrence\\r\\npredicted. But their intrinsic qualitative character is not reckoned\\r\\nwith, even in psychology, where the physiological method finally\\r\\nreplaces them with brain states. Over and above these neglected\\r\\nproperties of things there remain the purposive activities of thought.\\r\\nIt is equally preposterous to deny them and to describe them in\\r\\nmechanical terms. It is plain, then, that natural science calculates\\r\\nupon the basis of only a fraction of the conditions that present\\r\\nthemselves in actual experience. Its conclusions, therefore, though true\\r\\nso far as they go, and they may be abstractly true of everything, are\\r\\ncompletely true of nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: But Scientific Truth is Valid for Reality.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 53. Such, in brief, is the general charge of inadequacy which may be\\r\\nurged against natural science, not in the spirit of detraction, but for\\r\\nthe sake of a more sound belief concerning reality. The philosopher\\r\\nfalls into error no less radical than that of the dogmatic scientist,\\r\\nwhen he charges the scientist with untruth, and attaches to his concepts\\r\\nthe predicate of unreality. The fact that the concepts of science are\\r\\nselected, and only inadequately true of reality, should not be taken to\\r\\nmean that they are sportive or arbitrary. They are not \"devices\" or\\r\\nabbreviations, in any sense that does not attach to such symbolism as\\r\\nall thought involves. Nor are they merely \"hypothetical,\" though like\\r\\nall thought they are subject to correction.[142:7] The scientist does\\r\\nnot merely assert that the equation for energy is true if nature\\'s\\r\\ncapacity for work be measurable, but _that such is actually the case_.\\r\\nThe statistician does not arrive at results contingent upon the\\r\\nsupposition that men are numerable, but declares his sums and averages\\r\\nto be categorically true. Similarly scientific laws are true; only, to\\r\\nbe sure, so far as they go, but with no condition save the condition\\r\\nthat attaches to all knowledge, viz., that it shall not need correction.\\r\\nThe philosophy of science, therefore, is not the adversary of science,\\r\\nbut supervenes upon science in the interests of the ideal of final\\r\\ntruth. No philosophy of science is sound which does not primarily seek\\r\\nby an analysis of scientific concepts to understand science on its own\\r\\ngrounds. Philosophy may understand science better than science\\r\\nunderstands itself, but only by holding fast to the conviction of its\\r\\ntruth, and including it within whatever account of reality it may be\\r\\nable to formulate.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Relative Practical Value of Science and Philosophy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 54. Though philosophy be the most ancient and most exalted of human\\r\\ndisciplines, it is not infrequently charged with being the most\\r\\nunprofitable. Science has amassed a fortune of information, which has\\r\\nfacilitated life and advanced civilization. Is not philosophy, on the\\r\\nother hand, all programme and idle questioning? In the first place, no\\r\\nquestioning is idle that is logically possible. It is true that\\r\\nphilosophy shows her skill rather in the asking than in the answering of\\r\\nquestions. But the formal pertinence of a question is of the greatest\\r\\nsignificance. No valid though unanswered question can have a purely\\r\\nnegative value, and especially as respects the consistency or\\r\\ncompleteness of truth. But, in the second place, philosophy with all its\\r\\nlimitations serves mankind as indispensably as science. If science\\r\\nsupplies the individual with means of self-preservation, and the\\r\\ninstruments of achievement, philosophy supplies the ideals, or the\\r\\nobjects of deliberate construction. Such reflection as justifies the\\r\\nadoption of a fundamental life purpose is always philosophical. For\\r\\nevery judgment respecting final worth is a judgment _sub specie\\r\\neternitatis_. And the urgency of life requires the individual to pass\\r\\nsuch judgments. It is true that however persistently reflective he may\\r\\nbe in the matter, his conclusion will be premature in consideration of\\r\\nthe amount of evidence logically demanded for such a judgment. But he\\r\\nmust be as wise as he can, or he will be as foolish as conventionality\\r\\nand blind impulse may impel him to be. Philosophy determines for society\\r\\nwhat every individual must practically determine upon for himself, the\\r\\nmost reasonable plan of reality as a whole which the data and reflection\\r\\nof an epoch can afford. It is philosophy\\'s service to mankind to\\r\\ncompensate for the enthusiasm and concentration of the specialist, a\\r\\nservice needed in every \"present day.\" Apart from the philosopher,\\r\\npublic opinion is the victim of sensationalism, and individual opinion\\r\\nis further warped by accidental propinquity. It is the function of\\r\\nphilosophy to interpret knowledge for the sake of a sober and wise\\r\\nbelief. The philosopher is the true prophet, appearing before men in\\r\\nbehalf of that which is finally the truth. He is the spokesman of the\\r\\nmost considerate and comprehensive reflection possible at any stage in\\r\\nthe development of human thought. Owing to a radical misconception of\\r\\nfunction, the man of science has in these later days begun to regard\\r\\nhimself as the wise man, and to teach the people. Popular materialism is\\r\\nthe logical outcome of this determination of belief by natural science.\\r\\nIt may be that this is due as much to the indifference of the\\r\\nphilosopher as to the forwardness of the scientist, but in any case the\\r\\nresult is worse than conservative loyalty to religious tradition. For\\r\\nreligion is corrected surely though slowly by the whole order of\\r\\nadvancing truth. Its very inflexibility makes it proof against an\\r\\nover-emphasis upon new truth. It has generally turned out in time that\\r\\nthe obstinate man of religion was more nearly right than the adaptable\\r\\nintellectual man of fashion. But philosophy, as a critique of science\\r\\nfor the sake of faith, should provide the individual religious believer\\r\\nwith intellectual enlightenment and gentleness. The quality,\\r\\norderliness, and inclusiveness of knowledge, finally determine its\\r\\nvalue; and the philosopher, premature as his synthesis may some day\\r\\nprove to be, is the wisest man of his own generation. From him the man\\r\\nof faith should obtain such discipline of judgment as shall enable him\\r\\nto be fearless of advancing knowledge, because acquainted with its\\r\\nscope, and so intellectually candid with all his visions and his\\r\\ninspirations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[120:1] Ernst Mach: _Science of Mechanics_.

The stand-point and purpose of the philosopher define his task,\\r\\nbut they do not necessarily prearrange the division of it. That the task\\r\\nis a complex one, embracing many subordinate problems which must be\\r\\ntreated _seriatim_, is attested both by the breadth of its scope and the\\r\\nvariety of the interests from which it may be approached. But this\\r\\ncomplexity is qualified by the peculiar importance which here attaches\\r\\nto unity. That which lends philosophical quality to any reflection is a\\r\\nsteadfast adherence to the ideals of inclusiveness and consistency.\\r\\nHence, though the philosopher must of necessity occupy himself with\\r\\nsubordinate problems, these cannot be completely isolated from one\\r\\nanother, and solved successively. Perspective is his most indispensable\\r\\nrequisite, and he has solved no problem finally until he has provided\\r\\nfor the solution of all. His own peculiar conceptions are those which\\r\\n_order_ experience, and reconcile such aspects of it as other interests\\r\\nhave distinguished. Hence the compatibility of any idea with all other\\r\\nideas is the prime test of its philosophical sufficiency. On these\\r\\ngrounds it may confidently be asserted that the work of philosophy\\r\\ncannot be assigned by the piece to different specialists, and then\\r\\nassembled. There are no special philosophical problems which can be\\r\\nfinally solved upon their own merits. Indeed, such problems could never\\r\\neven be named, for in their discreteness they would cease to be\\r\\nphilosophical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe case of _metaphysics_ and _epistemology_ affords an excellent\\r\\nillustration. The former of these is commonly defined as the theory of\\r\\nreality or of first principles, the latter as the theory of knowledge.\\r\\nBut the most distinctive philosophical movement of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury issues from the idea that knowing and being are\\r\\nidentical.[150:1] The prime reality is defined as a knowing mind, and\\r\\nthe terms of reality are interpreted as terms of a cognitive process.\\r\\nIdeas and logical principles _constitute_ the world. It is evident that\\r\\nin this Hegelian philosophy epistemology embraces metaphysics. In\\r\\ndefining the relations of knowledge to its object, one has already\\r\\ndefined one\\'s fundamental philosophical conception, while _logic_, as\\r\\nthe science of the universal necessities of thought, will embrace the\\r\\nfirst principles of reality. Now, were one to divide and arrange the\\r\\nproblems of philosophy upon this basis, it is evident that one would not\\r\\nhave deduced the arrangement from the general problem of philosophy, but\\r\\nfrom a single attempted solution of that problem. It might serve as an\\r\\nexposition of Hegel, but not as a general philosophical programme.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother case in point is provided by the present-day interest in what is\\r\\ncalled \"_pragmatism_.\"[151:2] This doctrine is historically connected\\r\\nwith Kant\\'s principle of the \"primacy of the practical reason,\" in which\\r\\nhe maintained that the consciousness of duty is a profounder though less\\r\\nscientific insight than the knowledge of objects. The current doctrine\\r\\nmaintains that thought with its fruits is an expression of interest, and\\r\\nthat the will which evinces and realizes such an interest is more\\r\\noriginal and significant than that which the thinking defines. Such a\\r\\nview attaches a peculiar importance to the springs of conduct, and in\\r\\nits more systematic development[152:3] has regarded _ethics_ as the\\r\\ntrue prop\\xc3\\xa6deutic and proof of philosophy. But to make ethics the\\r\\nkey-stone of the arch, is to define a special philosophical system; for\\r\\nit is the very problem of philosophy to dispose the parts of knowledge\\r\\nwith a view to systematic construction. The relation of the provinces of\\r\\nmetaphysics, epistemology, logic, and ethics cannot, then, be defined\\r\\nwithout entering these provinces and answering the questions proper to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Dependence of the Order of Philosophical Problems upon\\r\\nthe Initial Interest.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 56. Since the above terms exist, however, there can be no doubt but\\r\\nthat important divisions within the general aim of philosophy have\\r\\nactually been made. The inevitableness of it appears in the variety of\\r\\nthe sources from which that aim may spring. The point of departure will\\r\\nalways determine the emphasis and the application which the philosophy\\r\\nreceives. If philosophy be needed to supplement more special interests,\\r\\nit will receive a particular character from whatever interest it so\\r\\nsupplements. He who approaches it from a definite stand-point will find\\r\\nin it primarily an interpretation of that stand-point.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Philosophy as the Interpretation of Life.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 57. There are two sources of the philosophical aim, which are\\r\\nperennial in their human significance. He, firstly, who begins with the\\r\\ndemands of life and its ideals, looks to philosophy for a reconciliation\\r\\nof these with the orderly procedure of nature. His philosophy will\\r\\nreceive its form from its illumination of life, and it will be an\\r\\nethical or religious philosophy. Spinoza, the great seventeenth-century\\r\\nphilosopher who justified mysticism after the manner of\\r\\nmathematics,[153:4] displays this temper in his philosophy:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"After experience had taught me that all the usual\\r\\n     surroundings of social life are vain and futile; seeing that\\r\\n     none of the objects of my fears contained in themselves\\r\\n     anything either good or bad, except in so far as the mind is\\r\\n     affected by them, I finally resolved to inquire whether there\\r\\n     might be some real good having power to communicate itself,\\r\\n     which would affect the mind singly, to the exclusion of all\\r\\n     else: whether, in fact, there might be anything of which the\\r\\n     discovery and attainment would enable me to enjoy continuous,\\r\\n     supreme, and unending happiness.\"[153:5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pursuance of this aim, though he deals with the problem of being in\\r\\nthe rigorous logical fashion of his day, the final words of his great\\r\\nwork are, \"Of Human Freedom\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whereas the wise man, in so far as he is regarded as such, is\\r\\n     scarcely at all disturbed in spirit, but, being conscious of\\r\\n     himself, and of God, and of things, by a certain eternal\\r\\n     necessity, never ceases to be, but always possesses true\\r\\n     acquiescence of his spirit. If the way which I have pointed\\r\\n     out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard, it may\\r\\n     nevertheless be discovered. Needs must it be hard, since it is\\r\\n     so seldom found. How would it be possible if salvation were\\r\\n     ready to our hand, and could without great labor be found,\\r\\n     that it should be by almost all men neglected? But all things\\r\\n     excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"[154:6]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Philosophy as the Extension of Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 58. On the other hand, one who looks to philosophy for the extension\\r\\nand correction of scientific knowledge will be primarily interested in\\r\\nthe philosophical definition of ultimate conceptions, and in the method\\r\\nwherewith such a definition is obtained. Thus the philosophy of the\\r\\nscientist will tend to be logical and metaphysical. Such is the case\\r\\nwith Descartes and Leibniz, who are nevertheless intimately related to\\r\\nSpinoza in the historical development of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Several years have now elapsed,\" says the former, \"since I\\r\\n     first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth,\\r\\n     many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I\\r\\n     afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and\\r\\n     from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking\\r\\n     once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had\\r\\n     adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the\\r\\n     foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding\\r\\n     superstructure in the sciences.\"[155:7]\\r\\n\\r\\nLeibniz\\'s mind was more predominantly logical even than Descartes\\'s. He\\r\\nsought in philosophy a supreme intellectual synthesis, a science of the\\r\\nuniverse.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Although,\" he says retrospectively, \"I am one of those who\\r\\n     have worked much at mathematics, I have none the less\\r\\n     meditated upon philosophy from my youth up; for it always\\r\\n     seemed to me that there was a possibility of establishing\\r\\n     something solid in philosophy by clear demonstrations. . . .\\r\\n     I perceived, after much meditation, that it is impossible to\\r\\n     find the _principles of a real unity_ in matter alone, or in\\r\\n     that which is only passive, since it is nothing but a\\r\\n     collection or aggregation of parts _ad infinitum_.\"[155:8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Historical Differentiation of the Philosophical Problem.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 59. Though these types are peculiarly representative, they are by no\\r\\nmeans exhaustive. There are as many possibilities of emphasis as there\\r\\nare incentives to philosophical reflection. It is not possible to\\r\\nexhaust the aspects of experience which may serve as bases from which\\r\\nsuch thought may issue, and to which, after its synthetic insight, it\\r\\nmay return. But it is evident that such divisions of philosophy\\r\\nrepresent in their order, and in the sharpness with which they are\\r\\nsundered, the intellectual autobiography of the individual philosopher.\\r\\nThere is but one method by which that which is peculiar either to the\\r\\nindividual, or to the special position which he adopts, may be\\r\\neliminated. Though it is impossible to tabulate the empty programme of\\r\\nphilosophy, we may name certain special problems that have appeared _in\\r\\nits history_. Since this history comprehends the activities of many\\r\\nindividuals, a general validity attaches to it. There has been,\\r\\nmoreover, a certain periodicity in the emergence of these problems, so\\r\\nthat it may fairly be claimed for them that they indicate inevitable\\r\\nphases in the development of human reflection upon experience. They\\r\\nrepresent a normal differentiation of interest which the individual\\r\\nmind, in the course of its own thinking, tends to follow. It is true\\r\\nthat it can never be said with assurance that any age is utterly blind\\r\\nto any aspect of experience. This is obviously the case with the\\r\\npractical and theoretical interests which have just been distinguished.\\r\\nThere is no age that does not have some practical consciousness of the\\r\\nworld as a whole, nor any which does not seek more or less earnestly to\\r\\nuniversalize its science. But though it compel us to deal abstractly\\r\\nwith historical epochs, there is abundant compensation in the\\r\\npossibility which this method affords of finding the divisions of\\r\\nphilosophy in the manifestation of the living philosophical spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Metaphysics Seeks a Most Fundamental Conception.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 60. To Thales, one of the Seven Wise Men of Greece, is commonly\\r\\nawarded the honor of being the founder of European philosophy. If he\\r\\ndeserve this distinction, it is on account of the question which he\\r\\nraised, and not on account of the answer which he gave to it. Aristotle\\r\\ninforms us that Thales held \"water\" to be \"the material cause of all\\r\\nthings.\"[157:9] This crude theory is evidently due to an interest in the\\r\\ntotality of things, an interest which is therefore philosophical. But\\r\\nthe interest of this first philosopher has a more definite character. It\\r\\nlooks toward the definition in terms of some single conception, of _the\\r\\nconstitution_ of the world. As a child might conceivably think the moon\\r\\nto be made of green cheese, so philosophy in its childhood thinks here\\r\\nof all things as made of water. Water was a well-known substance,\\r\\npossessing well-known predicates. To define all nature in terms of it,\\r\\nwas to maintain that in spite of superficial differences, all things\\r\\nhave these predicates in common. They are the predicates which qualify\\r\\nfor reality, and compose a community of nature from which all the\\r\\nindividual objects and events of nature arise. The successors of Thales\\r\\nwere evidently dissatisfied with his fundamental conception, because of\\r\\nits lack of generality. They seized upon vaguer substances like air and\\r\\nfire, for the very definiteness of the nature of water forbids the\\r\\nidentification of other substances with it. But what is so obviously\\r\\ntrue of water is scarcely less true of air and fire; and it appeared at\\r\\nlength that only a substance possessing the most general characters of\\r\\nbody, such as shape, size, and mobility, could be thought as truly\\r\\nprimeval and universal. In this wise a conception like our modern\\r\\nphysical conception of matter came at length into vogue. Now the problem\\r\\nof which these were all tentative solutions is, in general, the problem\\r\\nof _metaphysics_; although this term belongs to a later era, arising\\r\\nonly from the accidental place of the discussion of first principles\\r\\n_after physics_ in the system of Aristotle. _The attempt to secure a\\r\\nmost fundamental conception which attaches some definite meaning to the\\r\\nreality including and informing every particular thing, is metaphysics._\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Monism and Pluralism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 61. It must not be supposed that metaphysics is dogmatically committed\\r\\nto the reduction of all reality to a unity of nature. It is quite\\r\\nconsistent with its purpose that the parts of reality should be found to\\r\\ncompose a group, or an indefinite multitude of irreducibly different\\r\\nentities. But it is clear that even such an account of things deals with\\r\\nwhat is true of all reality, and even in acknowledging the variety of\\r\\nits constituents, attributes to them some kind of relationship. The\\r\\ndegree to which such a relationship is regarded as intimate and\\r\\nessential, determines the degree to which any metaphysical system is\\r\\n_monistic_,[159:10] rather than _pluralistic_. But the significance of\\r\\nthis difference will be better appreciated after a further\\r\\ndifferentiation of the metaphysical problem has been noted.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Ontology and Cosmology Concern Being and Process.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 62. It has already been suggested that the test of Thales\\'s conception\\r\\nlay in the possibility of deriving nature from it. A world principle\\r\\nmust be fruitful. Now an abstract distinction has prevailed more or less\\r\\npersistently in metaphysics, between _the general definition of being_,\\r\\ncalled _ontology_, and the study of the processes wherewith being is\\r\\ndivided into things and events. This latter study has to do primarily\\r\\nwith the details of experience enumerated and systematized by the\\r\\nnatural sciences. _To reconcile_ these, _or the course of nature, with\\r\\nthe fundamental definition of being_, is the problem of _cosmology_.\\r\\nCosmology is the construing of the _prima facie_ reality in terms of the\\r\\nessential reality. It is the proof and the explanation of ontology.\\r\\nSince the most familiar part of the _prima facie_ reality, the part\\r\\nalmost exclusively noticed by the naive mind, is embraced within the\\r\\nfield of the physical sciences, the term cosmology has come more\\r\\ndefinitely to signify the _philosophy of nature_. It embraces such an\\r\\nexamination of space, time, matter, causality, etc., as seeks to answer\\r\\nthe most general questions about them, and provide for them in the world\\r\\nthought of as most profoundly real. Such a study receives its\\r\\nphilosophical character from its affiliation with ontology, as the\\r\\nlatter would find its application in cosmology.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Mechanical and Teleological Cosmologies.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 63. But in addition to the consideration of the various parts of\\r\\nnature, cosmology has commonly dealt with a radical and far-reaching\\r\\nalternative that appeared at the very dawn of metaphysics. Differences\\r\\nmay arise within a world constituted of a single substance or a small\\r\\ngroup of ultimate substances, by changes in the relative position and\\r\\ngrouping of the parts. Hence the virtue of the conception of motion. The\\r\\ntheory which explains all differences by motions of the parts of a\\r\\nqualitatively simple world, is called _mechanism_. Another source of\\r\\nchange familiar to naive experience is _will_, or the action of living\\r\\ncreatures. According to the mechanical theory, _changes occur on account\\r\\nof the natural motions of the parts of matter_; according to the latter\\r\\nor _teleological_ conception, _changes are made by a formative agency\\r\\ndirected to some end_. Among the early Greek philosophers, Leucippus was\\r\\nan exponent of mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He says that the worlds arise when many bodies are collected\\r\\n     together into the mighty void from the surrounding space and\\r\\n     rush together. They come into collision, and those which are\\r\\n     of similar shape and like form become entangled, and from\\r\\n     their entanglement the heavenly bodies arise.\"[161:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnaxagoras, on the other hand, was famed for his doctrine of the Nous,\\r\\nor Intelligence, to whose direction he attributed the whole process of\\r\\nthe world. The following is translated from extant fragments of his\\r\\nbook, \"\\xcf\\x80\\xce\\xb5\\xcf\\x81\\xe1\\xbd\\xb6 \\xcf\\x86\\xe1\\xbd\\xbb\\xcf\\x83\\xce\\xb5\\xcf\\x89\\xcf\\x82\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And Nous had power over the whole revolution, so that it\\r\\n     began to revolve in the beginning. And it began to revolve\\r\\n     first from a small beginning; but the revolution now extends\\r\\n     over a larger space, and will extend over a larger still. And\\r\\n     all the things that are mingled together and separated off and\\r\\n     distinguished are all known by the Nous. And Nous set in order\\r\\n     all things that were to be and that were, and all things that\\r\\n     are not now and that are, and this revolution in which now\\r\\n     revolve the stars and the sun and the moon, and the air and\\r\\n     the ether that are separated off.\"[162:12]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Dualism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 64. It is clear, furthermore, that the doctrine of Anaxagoras not only\\r\\nnames a distinct kind of cause, but also ascribes to it an independence\\r\\nand intrinsic importance that do not belong to motion. Whereas motion is\\r\\na property of matter, intelligence is an originative power working out\\r\\npurposes of its own choosing. Hence we have here to do with a new\\r\\nontology. If we construe ultimate being in terms of mind, we have a\\r\\ndefinite substitute for the physical theories outlined above. Such a\\r\\ntheory is scarcely to be attributed to any Greek philosopher of the\\r\\nearly period; it belongs to a more sophisticated stage in the\\r\\ndevelopment of thought, after the rise of the problem of epistemology.\\r\\nBut Anaxagoras\\'s sharp distinction between the material of the world on\\r\\nthe one hand, and the author of its order and evolution on the other, is\\r\\nin itself worthy of notice. It contains the germ of a recurrent\\r\\nphilosophical _dualism_, which differs from pluralism in that it finds\\r\\ntwo and only two fundamental divisions of being, the physical, material,\\r\\nor potential on the one hand, and the mental, formal, or ideal on the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The New Meaning of Monism and Pluralism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 65. Finally, the alternative possibilities which these cosmological\\r\\nconsiderations introduce, bear directly upon the general question of the\\r\\ninterdependence of the parts of the world, a question which has already\\r\\nappeared as pertinent in ontology. Monism and pluralism now obtain a new\\r\\nmeaning. Where the world process is informed with some singleness of\\r\\nplan, as teleology proposes, the parts are reciprocally necessary, and\\r\\ninseparable from the unity. Where, on the other hand, the processes are\\r\\nrandom and reciprocally fortuitous, as Leucippus proposes, the world as\\r\\na whole is an aggregate rather than a unity. In this way uniformity in\\r\\nkind of being may prevail in a world the relations of whose parts are\\r\\ndue to chance, while diversity in kind of being may prevail in a world\\r\\nknit together by some thorough-going plan of organization. Thus monism\\r\\nand pluralism are conceptions as proper to cosmology as to ontology.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut enough has been said to demonstrate the interdependence of ontology\\r\\nand cosmology, of the theory of being and the theory of differentiation\\r\\nand process. Such problems can be only abstractly sundered, and the\\r\\ndistinctive character of any metaphysical system will usually consist in\\r\\nsome theory determining their relation. Philosophy returns to these\\r\\nmetaphysical problems with its thought enriched and its method\\r\\ncomplicated, after becoming thoroughly alive to the problems of\\r\\nepistemology, logic, and ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Epistemology Seeks to Understand the Possibility of\\r\\nKnowledge.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 66. _Epistemology is the theory of the possibility of knowledge_, and\\r\\nissues from criticism and scepticism. If we revert again to the history\\r\\nof Greek philosophy, we find a first period of enterprising speculation\\r\\ngiving place to a second period of hesitancy and doubt. This phase of\\r\\nthought occurs simultaneously with the brilliantly humanistic age of\\r\\nPericles, and it is undoubtedly true that energy is withdrawn from\\r\\nspeculation largely for the sake of expending it in the more lively and\\r\\nengaging pursuits of politics and art. But there are patent reasons\\r\\nwithin the sphere of philosophy itself for entailment of activity and\\r\\ntaking of stock. For three centuries men have taken their philosophical\\r\\npowers for granted, and used them without questioning them. Repeated\\r\\nattacks upon the problem of reality have resulted in no consensus of\\r\\nopinion, but only in a disagreement among the wise men themselves. A\\r\\ngreat variety of mere theories has been substituted for the old\\r\\nunanimity of religious tradition and practical life. It is natural under\\r\\nthese circumstances to infer that in philosophy man has overreached\\r\\nhimself. He would more profitably busy himself with affairs that belong\\r\\nto his own sphere, and find a basis for life in his immediate relations\\r\\nwith his fellows. The sophists, learned in tradition, and skilled in\\r\\ndisputation, but for the most part entirely lacking in originality, are\\r\\nthe new prophets. As teachers of rhetoric and morals, they represent the\\r\\npractical and secular spirit of their age; while in their avoidance of\\r\\nspeculation, and their critical justification of that course, they\\r\\nexpress its sceptical philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Scepticism, Dogmatism, and Agnosticism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 67. In their self-justification certain of the sophists attached\\r\\nthemselves to a definite doctrine maintained by those of their\\r\\npredecessors and contemporaries who were atomists, or followers of that\\r\\nsame Leucippus whom we have quoted. This doctrine was the result of an\\r\\nattempt to construe perception in terms of the motion of atoms. Outer\\r\\nobjects were said to give off fine particles which, through the\\r\\nmediation of the sense organs, impinged upon the soul-atom. But it was\\r\\nevident even to the early exponents of this theory that according to\\r\\nsuch an account, each perceiver is relegated to a world peculiar to his\\r\\nown stand-point. His perception informs him concerning his own states as\\r\\naffected by things, rather than concerning the things themselves. Upon\\r\\nthis ground the great sophist Protagoras is said to have based his\\r\\ndictum: \\xce\\xa0\\xe1\\xbd\\xb1\\xce\\xbd\\xcf\\x84\\xcf\\x89\\xce\\xbd \\xcf\\x87\\xcf\\x81\\xce\\xb7\\xce\\xbc\\xe1\\xbd\\xb1\\xcf\\x84\\xcf\\x89\\xce\\xbd \\xce\\xbc\\xe1\\xbd\\xb3\\xcf\\x84\\xcf\\x81\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbd \\xe1\\xbc\\x84\\xce\\xbd\\xce\\xb8\\xcf\\x81\\xcf\\x89\\xcf\\x80\\xce\\xbf\\xcf\\x82,--\"Man is the measure of all\\r\\nthings.\" This is the classic statement of the doctrine of relativity.\\r\\nBut we have now entered into the province of epistemology, and various\\r\\nalternatives confront us. Reduce thought to perception, define\\r\\nperception as relative to each individual, and you arrive at\\r\\n_scepticism_, or _the denial of the possibility of valid knowledge_.\\r\\nPlato expounds this consequence in the well-known discussion of\\r\\nProtagoras that occurs in the \"The\\xc3\\xa6tetus.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is to each\\r\\n     one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with\\r\\n     a declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other\\r\\n     yet stranger monster which has sensation, is the measure of\\r\\n     all things; then he might have shown a magnificent contempt\\r\\n     for our opinion of him by informing us at the outset that\\r\\n     while we were reverencing him like a God for his wisdom, he\\r\\n     was no better than a tadpole, not to speak of his\\r\\n     fellow-men--would not this have produced an overpowering\\r\\n     effect? For if truth is only sensation, and no man can discern\\r\\n     another\\'s feelings better than he, or has any superior right\\r\\n     to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but each,\\r\\n     as we have several times repeated, is to himself the sole\\r\\n     judge, and everything that he judges is true and right, why,\\r\\n     my friend, should Protagoras be preferred to the place of\\r\\n     wisdom and instruction, and deserve to be well paid, and we\\r\\n     poor ignoramuses have to go to him, if each one is the measure\\r\\n     of his own wisdom? . . . The attempt to supervise or refute\\r\\n     the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and\\r\\n     enormous piece of folly, if to each man his own are right; and\\r\\n     this must be the case if Protagoras\\'s Truth is the real truth,\\r\\n     and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving\\r\\n     oracles out of the shrine of his book.\"[167:13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the full swing of the pendulum from _dogmatism_, or the\\r\\nuncritical conviction of truth. A modified form of scepticism has been\\r\\ndeveloped in these later days under the influence of natural science,\\r\\nand is called _agnosticism_ or _positivism_. It accepts the Protagorean\\r\\ndoctrine only in the sense of attributing to human knowledge as a whole\\r\\nan incapacity for exceeding the range of perception. Beyond this realm\\r\\nof natural science, where theories can be sensibly verified, lies the\\r\\nunknowable realm, more real, but forever inaccessible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Source and Criterion of Knowledge According to Empiricism\\r\\nand Rationalism. Mysticism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 68. It is important to note that both scepticism and agnosticism agree\\r\\nin regarding _perception as the essential factor in knowledge_. So far\\r\\nat any rate as our knowledge is concerned, the certification of being\\r\\nconsists in perceivability. Knowledge is coextensive with actual and\\r\\npossible human experience. This account of the source and criterion of\\r\\nknowledge is called _empiricism_, in distinction from the counter-theory\\r\\nof _rationalism_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rationalistic motive was a quickening influence in Greek philosophy\\r\\nlong before it became deliberate and conspicuous in Socrates and Plato.\\r\\nParmenides, founder of the Eleatic School, has left behind him a poem\\r\\ndivided into two parts: \"The Way of Truth\" and \"The Way of\\r\\nOpinion.\"[168:14] In the first of these he expounds his esoteric\\r\\nphilosophy, which is a definition of being established by dialectical\\r\\nreasoning. He finds that being must be single, eternal, and changeless,\\r\\nbecause otherwise it cannot be thought and defined without\\r\\ncontradiction. The method which Parmenides here employs presupposes that\\r\\nknowledge consists in understanding rather than perception. Indeed, he\\r\\nregards the fact that the world of the senses is manifold and mutable as\\r\\nof little consequence to the wise man. The world of sense is the\\r\\nprovince of vulgar opinion, while that of reason is the absolute truth\\r\\nrevealed only to the philosopher. The truth has no concern with\\r\\nappearance, but is answerable only to the test of rationality. _That\\r\\nworld is real which one is able by thinking to make intelligible._ The\\r\\nworld is what a world must be in order to be possible at all, and the\\r\\nphilosopher can deduce it directly from the very conditions of thought\\r\\nwhich it must satisfy. He who would know reality may disregard what\\r\\nseems to be, provided he can by reflective analysis discover certain\\r\\ngeneral necessities to which being must conform. This is rationalism in\\r\\nits extreme form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rationalism of Socrates was more moderate, as it was more fruitful\\r\\nthan that of Parmenides. As is well known, Socrates composed no\\r\\nphilosophical books, but sought to inculcate wisdom in his teaching and\\r\\nconversation. His method of inculcating wisdom was to evoke it in his\\r\\ninterlocutor by making him considerate of the meaning of his speech.\\r\\nThrough his own questions he sought to arouse the questioning spirit,\\r\\nwhich should weigh the import of words, and be satisfied with nothing\\r\\nshort of a definite and consistent judgment. In the Platonic dialogues\\r\\nthe Socratic method obtains a place in literature. In the \"The\\xc3\\xa6tetus,\"\\r\\nwhich is, perhaps, the greatest of all epistemological treatises,\\r\\nSocrates is represented as likening his vocation to that of the midwife.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs,\\r\\n     but differs in that I attend men, and not women, and I look\\r\\n     after their souls when they are in labor, and not after their\\r\\n     bodies: and the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining\\r\\n     whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings\\r\\n     forth is a false idol or a noble and true birth. And, like the\\r\\n     midwives, I am barren, and the reproach which is often made\\r\\n     against me, that I ask questions of others and have not the\\r\\n     wit to answer them myself, is very just; the reason is that\\r\\n     the god compels me to be a midwife, but does not allow me to\\r\\n     bring forth. And therefore I am not myself at all wise, nor\\r\\n     have I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my\\r\\n     own soul, but those who converse with me profit. . . . It is\\r\\n     quite clear that they never learned anything from me; the\\r\\n     many fine discoveries to which they cling are of their own\\r\\n     making.\"[171:15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principle underlying this method is the insistence that a\\r\\nproposition, to be true of reality, must at least bespeak a mind that is\\r\\ntrue to itself, internally luminous, and free from contradiction. That\\r\\nwhich is to me nothing that I can express in form that will convey\\r\\nprecise meaning and bear analysis, is so far nothing at all. Being is\\r\\nnot, as the empiricist would have it, ready at hand, ours for the\\r\\nlooking, but is the fruit of critical reflection. Only reason,\\r\\novercoming the relativity of perception, and the chaos of popular\\r\\nopinion, can lay hold on the universal truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA very interesting tendency to clothe the articulations of thought with\\r\\nthe immediacy of perception is exhibited in _mysticism_, which\\r\\nattributes the highest cognitive power to an experience that transcends\\r\\nthought, an ineffable insight that is the occasional reward of thought\\r\\nand virtuous living. This theory would seem to owe its great vigor to\\r\\nthe fact that it promises to unite the universality of the rational\\r\\nobject with the vivid presence of the empirical object, though it\\r\\nsacrifices the definite content of both. The mystic, empiricist, and\\r\\nrationalist are in these several ways led to revise their metaphysics\\r\\nupon the basis of their epistemology, or to define reality in terms\\r\\ndictated by the means of knowing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Relation of Knowledge to its Object According to Realism,\\r\\nand the Representative Theory.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 69. But within the general field of epistemology there has arisen\\r\\nanother issue of even greater significance in its bearing upon\\r\\nmetaphysics. The first issue, as we have seen, has reference to the\\r\\ncriterion of knowledge, to the possibility of arriving at certainty\\r\\nabout reality, and the choice of means to that end. A second question\\r\\narises, concerning _the relation between the knowledge and its object or\\r\\nthat which is known_. This problem does not at first appear as an\\r\\nepistemological difficulty, but is due to the emphasis which the moral\\r\\nand religious interests of men give to the conception of the self. My\\r\\nknowing is a part of me, a function of that soul whose welfare and\\r\\neternal happiness I am seeking to secure. Indeed, my knowing is, so the\\r\\nwise men have always taught, the greatest of my prerogatives. Wisdom\\r\\nappertains to the philosopher, as folly to the fool. But though my\\r\\nknowledge be a part of me, and in me, the same cannot, lightly at any\\r\\nrate, be said of what I know. It would seem that I must distinguish\\r\\nbetween the knowledge, which is my act or state, an event in my life,\\r\\nand the known, which is object, and belongs to the context of the outer\\r\\nworld. _The object of knowledge_ would then be quite _independent of the\\r\\ncircumstance that I know it_. This theory has acquired the name of\\r\\n_realism_,[173:16] and is evidently as close to common sense as any\\r\\nepistemological doctrine can be said to be. If the knowledge consists in\\r\\nsome sign or symbol which in my mind stands for the object, but is\\r\\nquite other than the object, realism is given the form known as the\\r\\n_representative theory_. This theory is due to a radical distinction\\r\\nbetween the inner world of consciousness and the outer world of things,\\r\\nwhereby in knowledge the outer object requires a substitute that is\\r\\nqualified to belong to the inner world. Where, on the other hand, no\\r\\nspecific and exclusive nature is attributed to the inner world, realism\\r\\nmay flourish without the representative theory. In such a case the\\r\\nobject would be regarded as itself capable of entering into any number\\r\\nof individual experiences or of remaining outside them all, and without\\r\\non either account forfeiting its identity. This view was taken for\\r\\ngranted by Plato, but is elaborately defended in our own day. During the\\r\\nintervening period epistemology has been largely occupied with\\r\\ndifficulties inherent in the representative theory, and from that\\r\\ndiscussion there has emerged the theory of _idealism_,[175:17] the great\\r\\nrival theory to that of realism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Relation of Knowledge to its Object According to\\r\\nIdealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 70. The representative theory contains at least one obvious\\r\\ndifficulty. If the thinker be confined to his ideas, and if the reality\\r\\nbe at the same time beyond these ideas, how can he ever verify their\\r\\nreport? Indeed, what can it mean that an idea should be true of that\\r\\nwhich belongs to a wholly different category? How under such\\r\\ncircumstances can that which is a part of the idea be attributed with\\r\\nany certainty to the object? Once grant that you know only your ideas,\\r\\nand the object reduces to an unknown _x_, which you retain to account\\r\\nfor the outward pointing or reference of the ideas, but which is not\\r\\nmissed if neglected. The obvious though radical theory of idealism is\\r\\nalmost inevitably the next step. Why assume that there is any object\\r\\nother than the state of mind, since all positive content belongs to that\\r\\nrealm? The eighteenth century English philosopher, Bishop Berkeley, was\\r\\naccused by his contemporaries of wilful eccentricity, and even madness,\\r\\nfor his boldness in accepting this argument and drawing this conclusion:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The table I write on I say exists; that is, I see and feel\\r\\n     it: and if I were out of my study I should say it existed;\\r\\n     meaning thereby that if I was in my study I might perceive it,\\r\\n     or that some other spirit actually does perceive it. There was\\r\\n     an odor--that is, it was smelt; there was a sound--that is, it\\r\\n     was heard; a color or figure, and it was perceived by sight or\\r\\n     touch. This is all that I can understand by these and the like\\r\\n     expressions. For as to what is said of the _absolute_\\r\\n     existence of unthinking things, without any relation to their\\r\\n     being perceived, that is to me perfectly unintelligible. Their\\r\\n     _esse_ is _percipi_; nor is it possible that they should have\\r\\n     any existence out of the minds or thinking thing which\\r\\n     perceives them.\"[176:18]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Phenomenalism, Spiritualism, and Panpsychism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 71. In this paragraph Berkeley maintains that it is essential to\\r\\nthings, or at any rate to their qualities, that they _be perceived_.\\r\\nThis principle when expressed as an epistemological or metaphysical\\r\\ngeneralization, is called _phenomenalism_. But in another phase of his\\r\\nthought Berkeley emphasizes the _perceiver_, or _spirit_. The theory\\r\\nwhich maintains that the only real substances are these active selves,\\r\\nwith their powers and their states, has been called somewhat vaguely by\\r\\nthe name of _spiritualism_.[176:19] Philosophically it shows a strong\\r\\ntendency to develop into either _panpsychism_ or _transcendentalism_.\\r\\nThe former is radically empirical. Its classic representative is the\\r\\nGerman pessimist Schopenhauer, who defined reality in terms of will\\r\\nbecause that term signified to him most eloquently _the directly felt\\r\\nnature of the self_. This immediate revelation of the true inwardness of\\r\\nbeing serves as the key to an \"intuitive interpretation\" of the\\r\\ngradations of nature, and will finally awaken a sense of the presence of\\r\\nthe universal Will.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Transcendentalism, or Absolute Idealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 72. _Transcendentalism_, or _absolute idealism_, on the other hand,\\r\\nemphasizes the _rational activity_, rather than the bare subjectivity,\\r\\n_of the self_. The term \"transcendental\" has become associated with this\\r\\ntype of idealism through Kant, whose favorite form of argument, the\\r\\n\"transcendental deduction,\" was an analysis of experience with a view to\\r\\ndiscovering the categories, or formal principles of thought, implied in\\r\\nits meaning. From the Kantian method arose the conception of a standard\\r\\nor _absolute mind_ for the standard experience. This mind is\\r\\ntranscendental not in the sense of being alien, but in the sense of\\r\\nexceeding the human mind in the direction of what this means and strives\\r\\nto be. It is the ideal or normal mind, in which the true reality is\\r\\ncontained, with all the chaos of finite experience compounded and\\r\\nredeemed. There is no being but the absolute, the one all-inclusive\\r\\nspiritual life, in whom all things are inherent, and whose perfection is\\r\\nthe virtual implication of all purposive activities.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"God\\'s life . . . sees the one plan fulfilled through all the\\r\\n     manifold lives, the single consciousness winning its purpose\\r\\n     by virtue of all the ideas, of all the individual selves, and\\r\\n     of all the lives. No finite view is wholly illusory. Every\\r\\n     finite intent taken precisely in its wholeness is fulfilled in\\r\\n     the Absolute. The least life is not neglected, the most\\r\\n     fleeting act is a recognized part of the world\\'s meaning. You\\r\\n     are for the divine view all that you know yourself at this\\r\\n     instant to be. But you are also infinitely more. The\\r\\n     preciousness of your present purposes to yourself is only a\\r\\n     hint of that preciousness which in the end links their meaning\\r\\n     to the entire realm of Being.\"[178:20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fruitfulness of the philosopher\\'s reflective doubt concerning his\\r\\nown powers is now evident. Problems are raised which are not merely\\r\\nurgent in themselves, but which present wholly new alternatives to the\\r\\nmetaphysician. Rationalism and empiricism, realism and idealism, are\\r\\ndoctrines which, though springing from the epistemological query\\r\\nconcerning the possibility of knowledge, may determine an entire\\r\\nphilosophical system. They bear upon every question of metaphysics,\\r\\nwhether the fundamental conception of being, or the problems of the\\r\\nworld\\'s unity, origin, and significance for human life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[150:1] The post-Kantian movement in Germany--especially in so far as\\r\\ninfluenced by Hegel.

The first had at one time in the history of philosophy\\r\\na much narrower meaning than that which it now possesses. It was used to\\r\\napply to those who, after Plato, believed in the independent reality of\\r\\nideas, universals, or general natures. _Realists_ in this sense were\\r\\nopposed to _nominalists_ and _conceptualists_. Nominalism maintained the\\r\\nexclusive reality of individual substances, and reduced ideas to\\r\\nparticular signs having, like the _name_, a purely symbolical or\\r\\ndescriptive value. Conceptualism sought to unite realism and nominalism\\r\\nthrough the conception of mind, or an individual substance whose\\r\\nmeanings may possess universal validity. Though this dispute was of\\r\\nfundamental importance throughout the medi\\xc3\\xa6val period, the issues\\r\\ninvolved have now been restated. Realism in the old sense will, if held,\\r\\ncome within the scope of the broader epistemological realism defined\\r\\nabove. Nominalism is covered by empirical tendencies, and conceptualism\\r\\nby modern idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term _idealism_ is sometimes applied to Plato on account of his\\r\\ndesignation of ideas as the ultimate realities. This would be a natural\\r\\nuse of the term, but in our own day it has become inseparably associated\\r\\nwith the doctrine which attributes to being a dependence upon the\\r\\nactivity of mind. It is of the utmost importance to keep these two\\r\\nmeanings clear. In the preferred sense Plato is a realist, and so\\r\\nopposed to idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term _idealism_ is further confused on account of its employment in\\r\\nliterature and common speech to denote the control of ideals. Although\\r\\nthis is a kindred meaning, the student of philosophy will gain little or\\r\\nno help from it, and will avoid confusion if he distinguishes the term\\r\\nin its technical use and permits it in that capacity to acquire an\\r\\nindependent meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n[175:17] See _note_, p. 173.\\r\\n\\r\\n[176:18] Berkeley: _Principles of Human Knowledge_, Part I, Fraser\\'s\\r\\nedition, p. 259.\\r\\n\\r\\n[176:19] To be distinguished from the religious sect which bears the\\r\\nsame name.\\r\\n\\r\\n[178:20] Quoted from Professor Josiah Royce\\'s _The World and the\\r\\nIndividual, First Series_, pp. 426-427.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE NORMATIVE SCIENCES AND THE PROBLEMS OF RELIGION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Normative Sciences.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 73. There are three sets of problems whose general philosophical\\r\\nimportance depends upon the place which metaphysics assigns to the\\r\\n_human critical faculties_. Man passes judgment upon that which claims\\r\\nto be _true_, _beautiful_, or _good_, thus referring to ideals and\\r\\nstandards that define these values. Attempts to make these ideals\\r\\nexplicit, and to formulate principles which regulate their attainment,\\r\\nhave resulted in the development of the three so-called _normative\\r\\nsciences_: _logic_, _\\xc3\\xa6sthetics_, and _ethics_. These sciences are said\\r\\nto owe their origin to the Socratic method, and it is indeed certain\\r\\nthat their problem is closely related to the general rationalistic\\r\\nattitude.[180:1] In Plato\\'s dialogue, \"Protagoras,\" one may observe the\\r\\nmanner of the inception of both ethics and logic. The question at issue\\r\\nbetween Socrates and the master sophist Protagoras, is concerning the\\r\\npossibility of teaching virtue. Protagoras conducts his side of the\\r\\ndiscussion with the customary rhetorical flourish, expounding in set\\r\\nspeeches the tradition and usage in which such a possibility is\\r\\naccepted. Socrates, on the other hand, conceives the issue quite\\r\\ndifferently. One can neither affirm nor deny anything of virtue unless\\r\\none knows _what is meant by it_. Even the possession of such a meaning\\r\\nwas scarcely recognized by Protagoras, who was led by Socrates\\'s\\r\\nquestions to attribute to the various virtues an external grouping\\r\\nanalogous to that of the parts of the face. But Socrates shows that\\r\\nsince justice, temperance, courage, and the like, are admittedly similar\\r\\nin that they are all virtues, they must have in common some essence,\\r\\nwhich is virtue in general. This he seeks to define in the terms,\\r\\n_virtue is knowledge_. The interest which Socrates here shows in the\\r\\nreduction of the ordinary moral judgments to a system centering in some\\r\\nsingle fundamental principle, is the ethical interest. But this is at\\r\\nthe same time a particular application of the general rationalistic\\r\\nmethod of definition, and of the general rationalistic postulate that\\r\\none knows nothing until one can form unitary and determinate\\r\\nconceptions. The recognition which Socrates thus gives to criteria of\\r\\nknowledge is an expression of the logical interest. In a certain sense,\\r\\nindeed, the whole labor of Socrates was in the cause of the logical\\r\\ninterest. For he sought to demonstrate that belief is not necessarily\\r\\nknowledge; that belief may or may not be true. In order that it shall be\\r\\ntrue, and constitute knowledge, it must be well-grounded, and\\r\\naccompanied by an understanding of its object. Socrates thus set the\\r\\nproblem of logic, the discovery, namely, of those characters by virtue\\r\\nof the possession of which belief is knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Affiliations of Logic.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 74. Logic deals with the ground of belief, and thus distinguishes\\r\\nitself from the psychological account of the elements of the believing\\r\\nstate.[182:2] But it is not possible sharply to sunder psychology and\\r\\nlogic. This is due to the fact that the general principles which make\\r\\nbelief true, may be regarded quite independently of this fact. They then\\r\\nbecome the _most general truth_, belonging to the absolute, archetypal\\r\\nrealm, or to the mind of God.[182:3] When the general principles of\\r\\ncertainty are so regarded, logic can be distinguished from metaphysics\\r\\nonly by adding to the study of the general principles themselves, the\\r\\nstudy of the special conditions (mainly psychological) under which they\\r\\nmay be realized among men. In the history of human thought the name of\\r\\nlogic belongs to the study of this _attainment_ of truth, as the terms\\r\\n\\xc3\\xa6sthetics and ethics belong to the studies of the attainment of beauty\\r\\nand goodness.[183:4] It is evident that logic will have a peculiar\\r\\nimportance for the rationalist. For the empiricist, proposing to report\\r\\nupon things as they are given, will tend on the whole to maintain that\\r\\nknowledge has no properties save those which are given to it by its\\r\\nspecial subject-matter. One cannot, in short, define any absolute\\r\\nrelationship between the normative sciences and the other branches of\\r\\nphilosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Logic Deals with the Most General Conditions of Truth in\\r\\nBelief.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 75. _Logic is the formulation, as independently as possible of special\\r\\nsubject-matter, of that which conditions truth in belief._ Since logic\\r\\nis concerned with truth only in so far as it is predicated of belief,\\r\\nand since belief in so far as true is knowledge, logic can be defined as\\r\\nthe formulation of the most general principles of knowledge. The\\r\\nprinciples so formulated would be those virtually used to _justify_\\r\\nbelief or to disprove the imputation of error.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Parts of Formal Logic. Definition, Self-evidence,\\r\\nInference, and Observation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 76. What is called _formal logic_ is animated with the hope of\\r\\nextracting these formulations directly from an analysis of the procedure\\r\\nof thought. The most general logical principles which have appeared in\\r\\nthe historical development of formal logic are _definition_,\\r\\n_self-evidence_, _inference_, and _observation_. Each of these has been\\r\\ngiven special study, and each has given rise to special issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Definition_ has to do with the _formation of concepts_, or determinate\\r\\nand unequivocal meanings. The universality of such concepts, and their\\r\\nconsequent relation to particular things, was, as we have seen,\\r\\ninvestigated at a very early date, and gave rise to the great\\r\\nrealistic-nominalistic controversy.[184:5] A large part of the logical\\r\\ndiscussion in the Platonic dialogues is an outgrowth of the earlier\\r\\n\"eristic,\" a form of disputation in favor with the sophists, and\\r\\nconsisting in the adroit use of ambiguity.[184:6] It is natural that in\\r\\nits first conscious self-criticism thought should discover the need of\\r\\ndefinite terms. The perpetual importance of definition has been largely\\r\\ndue to the great prestige in modern philosophy of the method of\\r\\ngeometry, which was regarded by Descartes and Spinoza as the model for\\r\\nsystems of necessary truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Self-evidence_ is the principle according to which _conviction of truth\\r\\nfollows directly from an understanding of meaning_. In the practice of\\r\\nhis intellectual midwifery, Socrates presupposed that thought is capable\\r\\nof bringing forth its own certainties. And rationalism has at all times\\r\\nregarded truth as ultimately accredited by internal marks recognizable\\r\\nby reason. Such truth arrived at antecedent to acquaintance with\\r\\ninstances is called _a priori_, as distinguished from _a posteriori_\\r\\nknowledge, or observation after the fact. There can be no principles of\\r\\nself-evidence, but logicians have always been more or less concerned\\r\\nwith the enumeration of alleged self-evident principles, notably those\\r\\nof _contradiction_ and _identity_. A philosophical interest in the\\r\\nmathematical method has led to a logical study of axioms, but with a\\r\\nview rather to their fruitfulness than their intrinsic truth. Indeed,\\r\\nthe interest in self-evident truth has always been subordinate to the\\r\\ninterest in systematic truth, and the discovery of first principles most\\r\\ncommonly serves to determine the relative priority of definite\\r\\nconcepts, or the correct point of departure for a series of inferences.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of the famous Aristotelian logic consists in a study of\\r\\n_inference_, or _the derivation of new knowledge from old knowledge_.\\r\\nAristotle sought to set down and classify every method of advancing from\\r\\npremises. The most important form of inference which he defined was the\\r\\n_syllogism_, a scheme of reasoning to a conclusion by means of two\\r\\npremises having one term in common. From the premises \"all men are\\r\\nmortal\" and \"Socrates is a man,\" one may conclude that \"Socrates is\\r\\nmortal.\" This is an instance not only of the syllogism in general, but\\r\\nof its most important \"mood,\" the subsumption of a particular case under\\r\\na general rule. Since the decline of Aristotle\\'s influence in philosophy\\r\\nthere has been a notable decrease of interest in the different forms of\\r\\ninference; though its fundamental importance as the very bone and sinew\\r\\nof _reasoning_ or _deductive thinking_ has never been challenged. Its\\r\\nloss of pre\\xc3\\xabminence is in part due to the growth of empiricism,\\r\\nstimulated by the writings of Lord Bacon in the seventeenth century, and\\r\\nfostered by the subsequent development of experimental science.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Observation_ is the fundamental logical principle of empiricism. For a\\r\\nradical empiricism, knowledge would consist of descriptive\\r\\ngeneralizations based upon the summation of instances. That branch of\\r\\nlogic which deals with _the advance from individual instances to general\\r\\nprinciples_, is called _inductive logic_. It has resulted in the\\r\\nannouncement of canons of accuracy and freedom from preconception, and\\r\\nin the methodological study of hypothesis, experiment, and verification.\\r\\nRules for observation directed to the end of discovering causes,\\r\\nconstitute the most famous part of the epoch-making logic of J. S.\\r\\nMills.[187:7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Present Tendencies. Theory of the Judgment.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 77. There are two significant tendencies in contemporary logic.\\r\\n_Theories of the judgment_ have arisen in the course of an attempt to\\r\\ndefine the least complexity that must be present in order that thought\\r\\nshall come within the range of truth and error. It is evident that no\\r\\none either knows or is in error until he takes some attitude which lays\\r\\nclaim to knowledge. Denoting by the term _judgment_ this minimum of\\r\\ncomplexity in knowledge, an important question arises as to the sense in\\r\\nwhich the judgment involves the subject, predicate, and copula that are\\r\\ncommonly present in its propositional form.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Priority of Concepts.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 78. But a more important logical development has been due to the\\r\\nrecent analysis of definite accredited systems of knowledge. The study\\r\\nof the fundamental conceptions of mathematics and mechanics, together\\r\\nwith an examination of the systematic structure of these sciences,\\r\\nfurnishes the most notable cases. There are two senses in which such\\r\\nstudies may be regarded as logical. In the first place, in so far as\\r\\nthey bring to light the inner coherence of any body of truth, the kind\\r\\nof evidence upon which it rests, and the type of formal perfection which\\r\\nit seeks, they differ from formal logic only in that they derive their\\r\\ncriteria from cases, rather than from the direct analysis of the\\r\\nprocedure of thought. And since formal logic must itself make\\r\\nexperiments, this difference is not a radical one. The study of cases\\r\\ntends chiefly to enrich _methodology_, or the knowledge of the special\\r\\ncriteria of special sciences. In the second place, such studies serve to\\r\\ndefine the relatively few simple truths which are common to the\\r\\nrelatively many complex truths. A study of the foundations of arithmetic\\r\\nreveals more elementary conceptions, such as _class_ and _order_, that\\r\\nmust be employed in the very definition of number itself, and so are\\r\\nimplied in every numerical calculation. It appears similarly that the\\r\\naxioms of geometry are special axioms which involve the acceptance of\\r\\nmore general axioms or indefinables.[189:8] Logic in this sense, then,\\r\\nis the enumeration of conceptions and principles in the order of their\\r\\nindispensableness to knowledge. And while it must be observed that the\\r\\nmost general conceptions and principles of knowledge are not necessarily\\r\\nthose most significant for the existent world, nevertheless the careful\\r\\nanalysis which such an enumeration involves is scarcely less fruitful\\r\\nfor metaphysics than for logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: \\xc3\\x86sthetics Deals with the Most General Conditions of Beauty.\\r\\nSubjectivistic and Formalistic Tendencies.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 79. _\\xc3\\x86sthetics is the formulation, as independently as possible of\\r\\nspecial subject-matter, of that which conditions beauty._ As logic\\r\\ncommonly refers to a judgment of truth, so \\xc3\\xa6sthetics at any rate\\r\\n_refers_ to a judgment implied in appreciation. But while it is\\r\\ngenerally admitted that truth itself is by no means limited to the form\\r\\nof the judgment, the contrary is frequently maintained with reference\\r\\nto beauty. The aphorism, _De gustibus non est disputandum_, expresses a\\r\\ncommon opinion to the effect that beauty is not a property belonging to\\r\\nthe object of which it is predicated, but a property generated by the\\r\\nappreciative consciousness. According to this opinion there can be no\\r\\nbeauty except in the case of an object\\'s presence in an individual\\r\\nexperience. Investigators must of necessity refuse to leave individual\\r\\ncaprice in complete possession of the field, but they have in many cases\\r\\noccupied themselves entirely with the _state of \\xc3\\xa6sthetic enjoyment_ in\\r\\nthe hope of discovering its constant factors. The opposing tendency\\r\\ndefines certain _formal characters which the beautiful object must\\r\\npossess_. Evidently the latter school will attribute a more profound\\r\\nphilosophical importance to the conception of beauty, since for them it\\r\\nis a principle that obtains in the world of being. This was the first\\r\\nnotable contention, that of Plato. But even with the emphasis laid upon\\r\\nthe subjective aspect of the \\xc3\\xa6sthetic experience, great metaphysical\\r\\nimportance may be attached to it, where, as in the case of the German\\r\\nRomanticists, reality is deliberately construed as a spiritual life\\r\\nwhich is to be appreciated rather than understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the case of logic, a strong impulse has manifested itself in\\r\\n\\xc3\\xa6sthetics to deal with groups of objects that lie within its province,\\r\\nrather than directly with its concepts and principles. The first special\\r\\ntreatise on \\xc3\\xa6sthetics, the \"Poetics\" of Aristotle, belongs to this type\\r\\nof inquiry, as does all criticism of art in so far as it aims at the\\r\\nformulation of general principles.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Ethics Deals with the Most General Conditions of Moral\\r\\nGoodness.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 80. _Ethics_, the oldest and most popular of the normative sciences,\\r\\n_is the formulation, as independently as possible of special\\r\\nsubject-matter, of that which conditions goodness of conduct_. Ethics is\\r\\ncommonly concerned with goodness only in so far as it is predicated of\\r\\nconduct, or of character, which is a more or less permanent disposition\\r\\nto conduct. Since conduct, in so far as good, is said to constitute\\r\\nmoral goodness, ethics may be defined as the formulation of the general\\r\\nprinciples of _morality_. The principles so formulated would be those\\r\\nvirtually employed to _justify_ conduct, or to disprove the imputation\\r\\nof immorality.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Conceptions of the Good. Hedonism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 81. The student of this science is confronted with a very considerable\\r\\ndiversity of method and differentiation of problems. The earliest and\\r\\nmost profound opposition of doctrine in ethics arose from the\\r\\ndifferences of interpretation of which the teaching of Socrates is\\r\\ncapable. His doctrine is, as we have seen, verbally expressed in the\\r\\nproposition, _virtue is knowledge_. Socrates was primarily concerned to\\r\\nshow that there is no real living without an understanding of the\\r\\nsignificance of life. To live well is to know the end of life, the good\\r\\nof it all, and to govern action with reference to that end. Virtue is\\r\\ntherefore the practical wisdom that enables one to live consistently\\r\\nwith his real intention. But what is the real intention, the end or good\\r\\nof life? In the \"Protagoras,\" where Plato represents Socrates as\\r\\nexpounding his position, virtue is interpreted to mean prudence, or\\r\\nforesight of pleasurable and painful consequences. He who knows,\\r\\npossesses all virtue in that he is qualified to adapt himself to the\\r\\nreal situation and to gain the end of pleasure. All men, indeed, seek\\r\\npleasure, but only virtuous men seek it wisely and well.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And do you, Protagoras, like the rest of the world, call some\\r\\n     pleasant things evil and some painful things good?--for I am\\r\\n     rather disposed to say that things are good in as far as they\\r\\n     are pleasant, if they have no consequences of another sort,\\r\\n     and in as far as they are painful they are bad.\"[192:9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to this view painful things are good only when they lead\\r\\neventually to pleasure, and pleasant things evil only when their painful\\r\\nconsequences outweigh their pleasantness. Hence moral differences reduce\\r\\nto differences of skill in the universal quest for pleasure, and\\r\\n_sensible gratification is the ultimate standard of moral value_. This\\r\\nancient doctrine, known as _hedonism_, expressing as it does a part of\\r\\nlife that will not suffer itself for long to be denied, is one of the\\r\\ngreat perennial tendencies of ethical thought. In the course of many\\r\\ncenturies it has passed through a number of phases, varying its\\r\\nconception of pleasure from the tranquillity of the wise man to the\\r\\nsensuous titillations of the sybarite, and from the individualism of the\\r\\nlatter to the universalism of the humanitarian. But in every case it\\r\\nshows a respect for the natural man, praising morality for its\\r\\ndisciplinary and instrumental value in the service of such human wants\\r\\nas are the outgrowth of the animal instinct of self-preservation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Rationalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 82. But if a man\\'s life be regarded as a truer representation of his\\r\\nideals than is his spoken theory, there is little to identify Socrates\\r\\nwith the hedonists. At the conclusion of the defence of his own life,\\r\\nwhich Plato puts into his mouth in the well-known \"Apology,\" he speaks\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When my sons are grown up, I would ask you, O my friends, to\\r\\n     punish them; and I would have you trouble them, as I have\\r\\n     troubled you, if they seem to care about riches, or anything,\\r\\n     more than about virtue; or if they pretend to be something\\r\\n     when they are really nothing,--then reprove them, as I have\\r\\n     reproved you, for not caring about that for which they ought\\r\\n     to care, and thinking that they are something when they are\\r\\n     really nothing.\"[194:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is plain that the man Socrates cared little for the pleasurable or\\r\\npainful consequences of his acts, provided they were worthy of the high\\r\\ncalling of human nature. A man\\'s virtue would now seem to possess an\\r\\nintrinsic nobility. If knowledge be virtue, then on this basis it must\\r\\nbe because knowledge is itself excellent. Virtue as knowledge\\r\\ncontributes to the good by constituting it. We meet here with the\\r\\n_rationalistic_ strain in ethics. It praises conduct for the _inherent\\r\\nworth which it may possess if it express that reason_ which the Stoics\\r\\ncalled \"_the ruling part_.\" The riches of wisdom consist for the\\r\\nhedonist in their purchase of pleasure. For the rationalist, on the\\r\\nother hand, wisdom is not coin, but itself the very substance of value.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Eud\\xc3\\xa6monism and Pietism. Rigorism and Intuitionism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 83. Rationalism has undergone modifications even more significant\\r\\nthan those of hedonism, and involving at least one radically new group\\r\\nof conceptions. Among the Greeks rationalism and hedonism alike are\\r\\n_eud\\xc3\\xa6monistic_. They aim to portray _the fulness of life_ that makes\\r\\n\"the happy man.\" In the ethics of Aristotle, whose synthetic mind weaves\\r\\ntogether these different strands, the Greek ideal finds its most\\r\\ncomplete expression as \"the high-minded man,\" with all his powers and\\r\\ntrappings. But the great spiritual transformation which accompanied the\\r\\ndecline of Greek culture and the rise of Christianity, brought with it a\\r\\nnew moral sensibility, which finds in man no virtue of himself, but only\\r\\nthrough the grace of God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And the virtues themselves,\" says St. Augustine, \"if they\\r\\n     bear no relation to God, are in truth vices rather than\\r\\n     virtues; for although they are regarded by many as truly moral\\r\\n     when they are desired as ends in themselves and not for the\\r\\n     sake of something else, they are, nevertheless, inflated and\\r\\n     arrogant, and therefore not to be viewed as virtues but as\\r\\n     vices.\"[195:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new ideal is that of renunciation, obedience, and resignation.\\r\\nEthically this expresses itself in _pietism_. Virtue is good neither in\\r\\nitself nor on account of its consequences, but because it is\\r\\nconformable to the will of God. The extreme inwardness of this ideal is\\r\\ncharacteristic of an age that despaired of attainment, whether of\\r\\npleasure or knowledge. To all, even the persecuted, it is permitted to\\r\\nobey, and so gain entrance into the kingdom of the children of God. But\\r\\nas every special study tends to rely upon its own conceptions, pietism,\\r\\ninvolving as it does a relation to God, is replaced by _rigorism_ and\\r\\n_intuitionism_. The former doctrine defines virtue in terms of the inner\\r\\nattitude which it expresses. It must be done in the spirit of\\r\\ndutifulness, _because one ought_, and through sheer respect for the law\\r\\nwhich one\\'s moral nature affirms. _Intuitionism_ has attempted to deal\\r\\nwith the source of the moral law by defining conscience as a _special\\r\\nfaculty_ or sense, qualified to pass directly upon moral questions, and\\r\\ndeserving of implicit obediences. It is characteristic of this whole\\r\\ntendency to look for the spring of virtuous living, not in a good which\\r\\nsuch living obtains, but in a law to which it owes obedience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Duty and Freedom. Ethics and Metaphysics.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 84. This third general ethical tendency has thus been of the greatest\\r\\nimportance in emphasizing the _consciousness of duty_, and has brought\\r\\nboth hedonism and rationalism to a recognition of its fundamental\\r\\nimportance. Ethics must deal not only with the moral ideal, but also\\r\\nwith the ground of its appeal to the individual, and his obligation to\\r\\npursue it. In connection with this recognition of moral responsibility,\\r\\nthe problem of human _freedom_ has come to be regarded in the light of\\r\\nan inevitable point of contact between ethics and metaphysics. That\\r\\nwhich is absolutely binding upon the human will can be determined only\\r\\nin view of some theory of its ultimate nature. On this account the\\r\\nrationalistic and hedonistic motives are no longer abstractly sundered,\\r\\nas in the days of the Stoics and Epicureans, but tend to be absorbed in\\r\\nbroader philosophical tendencies. Hedonism appears as the sequel to\\r\\nnaturalism; or, more rarely, as part of a theistic system whose morality\\r\\nis divine legislation enforced by an appeal to motives of pleasure and\\r\\npain. Rationalism, on the other hand, tends to be absorbed in\\r\\nrationalistic or idealistic philosophies, where man\\'s rational nature is\\r\\nconstrued as his bond of kinship with the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEthics has exhibited from the beginning a tendency to universalize its\\r\\nconceptions and take the central place in metaphysics. Thus with Plato\\r\\ngood conduct was but a special case of goodness, the good being the most\\r\\ngeneral principle of reality.[198:12] In modern times Fichte and his\\r\\nschool have founded an ethical metaphysics upon the conception of\\r\\nduty.[198:13] In these cases ethics can be distinguished from\\r\\nmetaphysics only by adding to the study of the good or of duty, a study\\r\\nof the special physical, psychological, and social conditions under\\r\\nwhich goodness and dutifulness may obtain in human life. It is possible\\r\\nto attach the name of ethics, and we have seen the same to be true of\\r\\nlogic, either to a realm of ideal truth or to that realm wherein the\\r\\nideal is realized in humanity.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Virtues, Customs, and Institutions.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 85. A systematic study of ethics requires that the _virtues_, or types\\r\\nof moral practice, shall be interpreted in the light of the central\\r\\nconception of good, or of conscience. _Justice_, _temperance_, _wisdom_,\\r\\nand _courage_ were praised by the Greeks. Christianity added\\r\\n_self-sacrifice_, _humility_, _purity_, and _benevolence_. These and\\r\\nother virtues have been defined, justified, and co-ordinated with the\\r\\naid of a standard of moral value or a canon of duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is in modern ethics a pronounced tendency, parallel to those\\r\\nalready noted in logic and \\xc3\\xa6sthetics, to study such phenomena belonging\\r\\nto its field as have become historically established. A very\\r\\nconsiderable investigation of _custom_, _institutions_, and other social\\r\\nforces has led to a contact of ethics with anthropology and sociology\\r\\nscarcely less significant than that with metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Problems of Religion. The Special Interests of Faith.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 86. In that part of his philosophy in which he deals with faith, the\\r\\ngreat German philosopher Kant mentions God, Freedom, and Immortality as\\r\\nthe three pre-eminent religious interests. Religion, as we have seen,\\r\\nsets up a social relationship between man and that massive drift of\\r\\nthings which determines his destiny. Of the two terms of this relation,\\r\\nGod signifies the latter, while freedom and immortality are prerogatives\\r\\nwhich religion bestows upon the former. Man, viewed from the stand-point\\r\\nof religion as an object of special interest to the universe, is said to\\r\\nhave a soul; and by virtue of this soul he is said to be free and\\r\\nimmortal, when thought of as having a life in certain senses independent\\r\\nof its immediate natural environment. The attempt to make this faith\\r\\ntheoretically intelligible has led to the philosophical disciplines\\r\\nknown as _theology_ and _psychology_.[199:14]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Theology Deals with the Nature and Proof of God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 87. _Theology_, as a branch of philosophy, deals with _the proof and\\r\\nthe nature of God_. Since \"God\" is not primarily a theoretical\\r\\nconception, the proof of God is not properly a philosophical problem.\\r\\nHistorically, this task has been assumed as a legacy from Christian\\r\\napologetics; and it has involved, at any rate so far as European\\r\\nphilosophy is concerned, the definition of ultimate being in such\\r\\nspiritual terms as make possible the relation with man postulated in\\r\\nChristianity. For this it has been regarded as sufficient to ascribe to\\r\\nthe world an underlying unity capable of bearing the predicates of\\r\\nperfection, omnipotence, and omniscience. Each proof of God has defined\\r\\nhim pre-eminently in terms of some one of these his attributes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Ontological Proof of God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 88. The _ontological_ proof of God held the foremost place in\\r\\nphilosophy\\'s contribution to Christianity up to the eighteenth century.\\r\\nThis proof _infers the existence from the ideal_ of God, and so\\r\\napproaches the nature of God through the attribute of perfection. It\\r\\nowes the form in which it was accepted in the Middle Ages and\\r\\nRenaissance to St. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury at the close of the\\r\\neleventh century. He argued from the idea of a most perfect being to its\\r\\nexistence, on the ground that non-existence, or existence only in idea,\\r\\nwould contradict its perfection. It is evident that the force of this\\r\\nargument depends upon the necessity of the idea of God. The argument was\\r\\naccepted in Scholastic Philosophy[201:15] largely because of the virtual\\r\\nacceptance of this necessity. Medi\\xc3\\xa6val thought was under the dominance\\r\\nof the philosophical ideas of Plato and Aristotle, and through them\\r\\nrationalism had come to be the unquestioned starting-point for all\\r\\nthought. For Plato reality and rationality meant one and the same thing,\\r\\nso that the ultimate reality was the highest principle of rationality,\\r\\nwhich he conceived to be the idea of the good. In the case of Aristotle\\r\\nthe ideal of rationality was conceived to determine the course of the\\r\\ncosmical evolution as its immanent final cause. But in itself it was\\r\\nbeyond the world, or transcendent. For Plato perfection itself is\\r\\nreality, whereas for Aristotle perfection determines the hierarchical\\r\\norder of natural substances. The latter theory, more suitable to the\\r\\nuses of Christianity, because it distinguished between God and the\\r\\nworld, was incorporated into the great school systems. But both theories\\r\\ncontain the essence of the ontological proof of God. In thought one\\r\\nseeks the perfect truth, and posits it as at once the culmination of\\r\\ninsight and the meaning of life. The ideal of God is therefore a\\r\\nnecessary idea, because implied in all the effort of thought as the\\r\\nobject capable of finally satisfying it. St. Anselm adds little to the\\r\\nforce of this argument, and does much to obscure its real significance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn stating the ontological argument the term perfection has been\\r\\nexpressly emphasized, because it may be taken to embrace both truth and\\r\\ngoodness. Owing to a habit of thought, due in the main to Plato, it was\\r\\nlong customary to regard degrees of truth and goodness as\\r\\ninterchangeable, and as equivalent to degrees of reality. The _ens\\r\\nrealissimum_ was in its completeness the highest object both of the\\r\\nfaculty of cognition and of the moral will. But even in the scholastic\\r\\nperiod these two different aspects of the ideal were clearly recognized,\\r\\nand led to sharply divergent tendencies. More recently they have been\\r\\ndivided and embodied in separate arguments. _The epistemological_\\r\\nargument _defines God in terms of that absolute truth which is referred\\r\\nto in every judgment_. Under the influence of idealism this absolute\\r\\ntruth has taken the form of a universal mind, or all-embracing standard\\r\\nexperience, called more briefly the absolute. The _ethical_ argument, on\\r\\nthe other hand, conceives God as _the perfect goodness implied in the\\r\\nmoral struggle, or the power through which goodness is made to triumph\\r\\nin the universe_ to the justification of moral faith. While the former\\r\\nof these arguments identifies God with being, the latter defines God in\\r\\nterms of the intent or outcome of being. Thus, while the epistemological\\r\\nargument does not distinguish God and the world, the latter does so,\\r\\nassuming that independent reality can be attributed to the stages of a\\r\\nprocess and to the purpose that dominates it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Cosmological Proof of God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 89. The _cosmological_ proof of God approaches him through the\\r\\nattribute of creative omnipotence. The common principle of causal\\r\\nexplanation refers the origin of natural events to similar antecedent\\r\\nevents. But there must be some _first cause_ from which the whole series\\r\\nis derived, a cause which is ultimate, sufficient to itself, and the\\r\\nresponsible author of the world. Because God\\'s function as creator was a\\r\\npart of the Christian teaching, and because explanation by causes is\\r\\nhabitual with common sense, this argument has had great vogue. But in\\r\\nphilosophy it has declined in importance, chiefly because it has been\\r\\nabsorbed in arguments which deal with the _kind_ of causality proper to\\r\\na first cause or world-ground. The argument that follows is a case in\\r\\npoint.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Teleological Proof of God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 90. The _teleological_ proof argues that the world can owe its origin\\r\\nonly to an _intelligent first cause_. The evidence for this is furnished\\r\\nby the cunning contrivances and beneficent adaptations of nature. These\\r\\ncould not have come about through chance or the working of mechanical\\r\\nforces, but only through the foresight of a rational will. This argument\\r\\noriginally infers God from the character of nature and history; and the\\r\\nextension of mechanical principles to organic and social phenomena,\\r\\nespecially as stimulated by Darwin\\'s principle of natural selection, has\\r\\ntended greatly to diminish its importance. When, on the other hand, for\\r\\nnature and history there are substituted the intellectual and moral\\r\\nactivities themselves, and the inference is made to the ideal which they\\r\\nimply, the teleological argument merges into the ontological. But the\\r\\nold-fashioned statement of it remains in the form of religious faith,\\r\\nand in this capacity it has had the approval even of Hume and Kant, the\\r\\nphilosophers who have contributed most forcibly to its overthrow as a\\r\\ndemonstration of God. They agree that the _acknowledgment_ of God in\\r\\nnature and history is the sequel to a theistic belief, and an inevitable\\r\\nattitude on the part of the religious consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: God and the World. Theism and Pantheism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 91. Another group of ideas belonging to philosophical theology\\r\\nconsists of three generalizations respecting God\\'s relation to the\\r\\nworld, known as _theism_, _pantheism_, and _deism_. Although,\\r\\ntheoretically, these are corollaries of the different arguments for God,\\r\\ntwo of them, theism and pantheism, owe their importance to their rivalry\\r\\nas religious tendencies. _Theism_ emphasizes that attitude to God which\\r\\nrecognizes in him an historical personage, in some sense distinct from\\r\\nboth the world and man, which are his works and yet stand in an external\\r\\nrelationship to him. It expresses the spirit of ethical and monotheistic\\r\\nreligion, and is therefore the natural belief of the Christian.\\r\\n_Pantheism_ appears in primitive religion as an animistic or\\r\\npolytheistic sense of the presence of a divine principle diffused\\r\\nthroughout nature. But it figures most notably in the history of\\r\\nreligions, in the highly reflective Brahmanism of India. In sharp\\r\\nopposition to Christianity, this religion preaches the indivisible unity\\r\\nof the world and the illusoriness of the individual\\'s sense of his own\\r\\nindependent reality. In spite of the fact that such a doctrine is alien\\r\\nto the spirit of Christianity, it enters into Christian theology through\\r\\nthe influence of philosophy. The theoretical idea of God tends, as we\\r\\nhave seen, to the identification of him with the world as its most real\\r\\nprinciple. Or it bestows upon him a nature so logical and formal, and so\\r\\nfar removed from the characters of humanity, as to forbid his entering\\r\\ninto personal or social relations. Such reflections concerning God find\\r\\ntheir religious expression in a mystical sense of unity, which has in\\r\\nmany cases either entirely replaced or profoundly modified the theistic\\r\\nstrain in Christianity. In current philosophy pantheism appears in the\\r\\nepistemological argument which identifies God with being; while the\\r\\nchief bulwark of theism is the ethical argument, with its provision for\\r\\na distinction between the actual world and ideal principle of evolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Deism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 92. While theism and pantheism appear to be permanent phases in the\\r\\nphilosophy of religion, _deism_ is the peculiar product of the\\r\\neighteenth century. It is based upon a repudiation of supernaturalism\\r\\nand \"enthusiasm,\" on the one hand, and a literal acceptance of the\\r\\ncosmological and teleological proofs on the other. Religions, like all\\r\\nelse, were required, in this epoch of clear thinking, to submit to the\\r\\ncanons of experimental observation and practical common sense. These\\r\\nauthorize only a _natural religion_, the acknowledgment in pious living\\r\\nof a God who, having contrived this natural world, has given it over to\\r\\nthe rule, not of priests and prophets, but of natural law. The\\r\\nartificiality of its conception of God, and the calculating spirit of\\r\\nits piety, make deism a much less genuine expression of the religious\\r\\nexperience than either the moral chivalry of theism or the intellectual\\r\\nand mystical exaltation of pantheism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Metaphysics and Theology.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 93. The systematic development of philosophy leads to the inclusion of\\r\\nconceptions of God within the problem of metaphysics, and the\\r\\nsubordination of the proof of God to the determination of the\\r\\nfundamental principle of reality. There will always remain, however, an\\r\\noutstanding theological discipline, whose function it is to interpret\\r\\nworship, or the living religious attitude, in terms of the theoretical\\r\\nprinciples of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Psychology is the Theory of the Soul.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 94. _Psychology is the theory of the soul._ As we have already seen,\\r\\nthe rise of scepticism directs attention from the object of thought to\\r\\nthe thinker, and so emphasizes the self as a field for theoretical\\r\\ninvestigation. But the original and the dominating interest in the self\\r\\nis a practical one. The precept, \\xce\\xb3\\xce\\xbd\\xe1\\xbf\\xb6\\xce\\xb8\\xce\\xb9 \\xcf\\x83\\xce\\xb5\\xce\\xb1\\xcf\\x85\\xcf\\x84\\xe1\\xbd\\xb9\\xce\\xbd, has its deepest\\r\\njustification in the concern for the salvation of one\\'s soul. In\\r\\nprimitive and half-instinctive belief the self is recognized in\\r\\npractical relations. In its animistic phase this belief admitted of such\\r\\nrelations with all living creatures, and extended the conception of life\\r\\nvery generally to natural processes. Thus in the beginning the self was\\r\\ndoubtless indistinguishable from the vital principle. In the first\\r\\ntreatise on psychology, the \"\\xcf\\x80\\xce\\xb5\\xcf\\x81\\xe1\\xbd\\xb6 \\xce\\xa8\\xcf\\x85\\xcf\\x87\\xe1\\xbf\\x86\\xcf\\x82\" of Aristotle, this\\r\\ninterpretation finds a place in theoretical philosophy. For Aristotle\\r\\nthe soul is the _entelechy_ of the body--that function or activity which\\r\\nmakes a man of it. He recognized, furthermore, three stages in this\\r\\nactivity: the nutritive, sensitive, and rational souls, or the\\r\\nvegetable, animal, and distinctively human natures, respectively. The\\r\\nrational soul, in its own proper activity, is man\\'s highest\\r\\nprerogative, the soul to be saved. By virtue of it man rises above\\r\\nbodily conditions, and lays hold on the divine and eternal. But Plato,\\r\\nwho, as we have seen, was ever ready to grant reality to the ideal apart\\r\\nfrom the circumstances of its particular embodiment, had already\\r\\nundertaken to demonstrate the immortality of the soul on the ground of\\r\\nits distinctive nature.[209:16] According to his way of thinking, the\\r\\nsoul\\'s essentially moral nature made it incapable of destruction through\\r\\nthe operation of natural causes. It is evident, then, that there were\\r\\nalready ideas in vogue capable of interpreting the Christian teaching\\r\\nconcerning the existence of a soul, or of an inner essence of man\\r\\ncapable of being made an object of divine interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Spiritual Substance]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 95. The immediate effect of Christianity was to introduce into\\r\\nphilosophy as one of its cardinal doctrines the theory of a spiritual\\r\\nbeing, constituting the true self of the individual, and separable from\\r\\nthe body. The difference recognized in Plato and Aristotle between the\\r\\ndivine spark and the appetitive and perceptual parts of human nature was\\r\\nnow emphasized. The former (frequently called the \"spirit,\" to\\r\\ndistinguish it from the lower soul) was defined as a _substance_ having\\r\\nthe attributes of thought and will. The fundamental argument for its\\r\\nexistence was the immediate appeal to self-consciousness; and it was\\r\\nfurther defined as indestructible on the ground of its being utterly\\r\\ndiscontinuous and incommensurable with its material environment. This\\r\\ntheory survives at the present day in the conception of pure activity,\\r\\nbut on the whole the attributes of the soul have superseded its\\r\\nsubstance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Intellectualism and Voluntarism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 96. _Intellectualism and voluntarism_ are the two rival possibilities\\r\\nof emphasis when the soul is defined in terms of its known activities.\\r\\nWherever the essence of personality is in question, as also occurs in\\r\\nthe case of theology, thought and will present their respective claims\\r\\nto the place of first importance. _Intellectualism would make will\\r\\nmerely the concluding phase of thought, while voluntarism would reduce\\r\\nthought to one of the interests of a general appetency._ It is evident\\r\\nthat idealistic theories will be much concerned with this question of\\r\\npriority. It is also true, though less evident, that intellectualism,\\r\\nsince it emphasizes the general and objective features of the mind,\\r\\ntends to subordinate the individual to the universal; while voluntarism,\\r\\nemphasizing desire and action, is relatively individualistic, and so,\\r\\nsince there are many individuals, also pluralistic.[211:17]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Freedom of the Will. Necessitarianism, Determinism, and\\r\\nIndeterminism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 97. The question of the _freedom of the will_ furnishes a favorite\\r\\ncontroversial topic in philosophy. For the interest at stake is no less\\r\\nthan the individual\\'s responsibility before man and God for his good or\\r\\nbad works. It bears alike upon science, religion, and philosophy, and is\\r\\nat the same time a question of most fundamental practical importance.\\r\\nBut this diffusion of the problem has led to so considerable a\\r\\ncomplication of it that it becomes necessary in outlining it to define\\r\\ntwo issues. In the first place, the concept of freedom is designed to\\r\\nexpress generally the distinction between man and the rest of nature. To\\r\\nmake man in all respects _the product and creature of his natural\\r\\nenvironment_ would be to deny freedom and accept the radically\\r\\n_necessitarian_ doctrine. The question still remains, however, as to the\\r\\ncauses which dominate man. He may be free from nature, and yet be ruled\\r\\nby God, or by distinctively spiritual causes, such as ideas or\\r\\ncharacter. Where in general the will is regarded as submitting only to a\\r\\n_spiritual causation_ proper to its own realm, the conception is best\\r\\nnamed _determinism_; though in the tradition of philosophy it is held to\\r\\nbe a doctrine of freedom, because contrasted with the necessitarianism\\r\\nabove defined. There remains _indeterminism_, which attributes to the\\r\\nwill a spontaneity that makes possible the _direct presence to it of\\r\\ngenuine alternatives_. The issue may here coincide with that between\\r\\nintellectualism and voluntarism. If, _e.g._, in God\\'s act of creation,\\r\\nhis ideals and standards are prior to his fiat, his conduct is\\r\\ndetermined; whereas it is free in the radical or indeterministic sense\\r\\nif his ideals themselves are due to his sheer will. This theory involves\\r\\nat a certain point in action the absence of cause. On this account the\\r\\nfree will is often identified with _chance_, in which case it loses its\\r\\ndistinction from nature, and we have swung round the circle.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Immortality. Survival and Eternalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 98. There is similar complexity in the problem concerning\\r\\n_immortality_. Were the extreme claims of naturalism to be established,\\r\\nthere would be no ground whatsoever upon which to maintain the\\r\\nimmortality of man, mere dust returning unto dust. The philosophical\\r\\nconcept of immortality is due to the supposition that the quintessence\\r\\nof the individual\\'s nature is divine.[213:18] But several possibilities\\r\\nare at this point open to us. The first would maintain the survival\\r\\nafter death of a recognizable and discrete personality. Another would\\r\\nsuppose a preservation after death, through being taken up into the life\\r\\nof God. Still another, the theory commonly maintained on the ground of\\r\\nrationalistic and idealistic metaphysics, would deny that immortality\\r\\nhas to do with life after death, and affirm that it signifies the\\r\\nperpetual membership of the human individual in a realm of eternity\\r\\nthrough the truth or virtue that is in him. But this interpretation\\r\\nevidently leaves open the question of the immortality of that which is\\r\\ndistinctive and personal in human nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Natural Science of Psychology. Its Problems and Method.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 99. So far we have followed the fortunes only of the \"spirit\" of man.\\r\\nWhat of that lower soul through which he is identified with the fortunes\\r\\nof his body? When philosophy gradually ceased, in the sixteenth and\\r\\nseventeenth centuries, to be \"the handmaid of religion,\" there arose a\\r\\nrenewed interest in that part of human nature lying between the strictly\\r\\nphysiological functions, on the one hand, and thought and will on the\\r\\nother. Descartes and Spinoza analyzed what they called the \"passions,\"\\r\\nmeaning such states of mind as are conditioned by a concern for the\\r\\ninterests of the body. At a later period, certain English philosophers,\\r\\nfollowing Locke, traced the dependence of ideas upon the senses. Their\\r\\nmethod was that of _introspection_, or the direct examination by the\\r\\nindividual of his own ideas, and for the sake of noting their origin and\\r\\ncomposition from simple factors. The lineal descendants of these same\\r\\nEnglish philosophers defined more carefully the process of\\r\\n_association_, whereby the complexity and sequence of ideas are brought\\r\\nabout, and made certain conjectures as to its dependence upon properties\\r\\nand transactions in the physical brain. These are the three main\\r\\nphilosophical sources of what has now grown to be the separate _natural\\r\\nscience of psychology_. It will be noted that there are two\\r\\ncharacteristics which all of these studies have in common. They deal\\r\\nwith the experience of the individual as composing his own private\\r\\nhistory, and tend to attribute the specific course which this private\\r\\nhistory takes to bodily conditions. It is only recently that these\\r\\ninvestigations have acquired sufficient unity and exclusiveness of aim\\r\\nto warrant their being regarded as a special science. But such is now so\\r\\nfar the case that the psychologist of this type pursues his way quite\\r\\nindependently of philosophy. It is true his research has advanced\\r\\nconsiderably beyond his understanding of its province. But it is\\r\\ngenerally recognized that he must examine those very _factors of\\r\\nsubjectivity_ which the natural scientist otherwise seeks to evade, and,\\r\\nfurthermore, that he must seek to _provide for them in nature_. He\\r\\ntreats the inner life in what Locke called \"the plain historical\\r\\nmethod,\" that is to say, instead of interpreting and defining its ideas,\\r\\nhe analyzes and reports upon its content. He would not seek to justify a\\r\\nmoral judgment, as would ethics, or to criticise the cogency of thought,\\r\\nas would logic; but only to describe the actual state as he found it. In\\r\\norder to make his data commensurable with the phenomena of nature, he\\r\\ndiscovers or defines bodily conditions for the subjective content which\\r\\nhe analyzes. His fundamental principle of method is the postulate of\\r\\n_psycho-physical parallelism_, according to which he assumes a _state of\\r\\nbrain or nervous system for every state of mind_. But in adopting a\\r\\nprovince and a method the psychologist foregoes finality of truth after\\r\\nthe manner of all natural science. He deals admittedly with an aspect of\\r\\nexperience, and his conclusions are no more adequate to the nature of\\r\\nthe self than they are to the nature of outer objects. An admirable\\r\\nreference to this abstract division of experience occurs in K\\xc3\\xbclpe\\'s\\r\\n\"Introduction to Philosophy\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For the developed consciousness, as for the naive, every\\r\\n     experience is an unitary whole; and it is only the habit of\\r\\n     abstract reflection upon experience that makes the objective\\r\\n     and subjective worlds seem to fall apart as originally\\r\\n     different forms of existence. Just as a plane curve can be\\r\\n     represented in analytical geometry as the function of two\\r\\n     variables, the absciss\\xc3\\xa6 and the ordinates, without prejudice\\r\\n     to the unitary course of the curve itself, so the world of\\r\\n     human experience may be reduced to a subjective and an\\r\\n     objective factor, without prejudice to its real\\r\\n     coherence.\"[215:19]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Psychology and Philosophy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 100. The problems of psychology, like those of theology, tend to\\r\\ndisappear as independent philosophical topics. The ultimate nature of\\r\\nthe self will continue to interest philosophers--more deeply, perhaps,\\r\\nthan any aspect of experience--but their conception of it will be a\\r\\ncorollary of their metaphysics and epistemology. The remainder of the\\r\\nfield of the old philosophical psychology, the introspective and\\r\\nexperimental analysis of special states of mind, is already the\\r\\nprovince of a natural science which is becoming more and more free from\\r\\nthe stand-point and method of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Transition from Classification by Problems to Classification\\r\\nby Doctrines.

Reminding ourselves anew that philosophical problems cannot be\\r\\ntreated in isolation from one another, we shall hereinafter seek to\\r\\nbecome acquainted with general stand-points that give systematic unity\\r\\nto the issues which have been enumerated. Such stand-points are not\\r\\nclearly defined by those who occupy them, and they afford no clear-cut\\r\\nclassification of all historical philosophical philosophies. But\\r\\nsystem-making in philosophy is commonly due to the moving in an\\r\\nindividual mind of some most significant idea; and certain of these\\r\\nideas have reappeared so frequently as to define more or less clearly\\r\\nmarked tendencies, or continuous strands, out of which the history of\\r\\nthought is forever weaving itself. Such is clearly the case with\\r\\n_naturalism_. From the beginning until now there have been men whose\\r\\nphilosophy is a summation of the natural sciences, whose entire thought\\r\\nis based upon an acceptance of the methods and the fundamental\\r\\nconceptions of these disciplines. This tendency stands in the history\\r\\nof thought for the conviction that the visible and tangible world which\\r\\ninteracts with the body is veritable reality. This philosophy is\\r\\nrealistic and empirical to an extent entirely determined by its belief\\r\\nconcerning being. But while naturalism is only secondarily\\r\\nepistemological, _subjectivism_ and _absolute idealism_ have their very\\r\\nsource in the self-examination and the self-criticism of thought.\\r\\nSubjectivism signifies the conviction that the knower cannot escape\\r\\nhimself. If reality is to be kept within the range of possible\\r\\nknowledge, it must be defined in terms of the processes or states of\\r\\nselves. _Absolute idealism_ arises from a union of this epistemological\\r\\nmotive with a recognition of what are regarded as the logical\\r\\nnecessities to which reality must submit. Reality must be both knowledge\\r\\nand rational knowledge; the object, in short, of an absolute mind, which\\r\\nshall be at once all-containing and systematic. This rationalistic\\r\\nmotive was, however, not originally associated with an idealistic\\r\\nepistemology, but with the common-sense principle that being is\\r\\ndiscovered and not constituted by thought. Such an _absolute realism_\\r\\nis, like naturalism, primarily metaphysical rather than\\r\\nepistemological; but, unlike naturalism, it seeks to define reality as\\r\\na logical or ethical necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these several divisions, then, we shall meet once more with the\\r\\nspecial problems of philosophy, but this time they will be ranged in an\\r\\norder that is determined by some central doctrine. They will appear as\\r\\nparts not of the general problem of philosophy, but of some definite\\r\\nsystem of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[180:1] Cf. \\xc2\\xa7 68.\\r\\n\\r\\n[182:2] The Socratic distinction between the logical and the\\r\\npsychological treatment of belief finds its best expression in Plato\\'s\\r\\n_Gorgias_, especially, 454, 455.

The meaning conveyed by any philosophical term consists largely\\r\\nof the distinctions which it suggests. Its peculiar quality, like the\\r\\nphysiognomy of the battle-scarred veteran, is a composite of the\\r\\ncontroversies which it has survived. There is, therefore, an almost\\r\\nunavoidable confusion attendant upon the denomination of any early phase\\r\\nof philosophy as _materialism_. But in the historical beginnings of\\r\\nthought, as also in the common-sense of all ages, there is at any rate\\r\\npresent a very essential strand of this theory. The naive habit of mind\\r\\nwhich, in the sixth century before Christ, prompted successive Greek\\r\\nthinkers to define reality in terms of water, air, and fire, is in this\\r\\nrespect one with that exhibited in Dr. Samuel Johnson\\'s smiting the\\r\\nground with his stick in curt refutation of Bishop Berkeley\\'s\\r\\nidea-philosophy. There is a theoretical instinct, not accidental or\\r\\nperverse, but springing from the very life-preserving equipment of the\\r\\norganism, which attributes reality to _tangible space-filling things\\r\\nencountered by the body_. For obvious reasons of self-interest the\\r\\norganism is first of all endowed with a sense of contact, and the more\\r\\ndelicate senses enter into its practical economy as means of\\r\\nanticipating or avoiding contact. From such practical expectations\\r\\nconcerning the proximity of that which may press upon, injure, or\\r\\ndisplace the body, arise the first crude judgments of reality. And these\\r\\nare at the same time the nucleus of naive philosophy and the germinal\\r\\nphase of materialism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Corporeal Being.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 103. The first philosophical movement among the Greeks was a series of\\r\\nattempts to reduce the tangible world to unity, and of these the\\r\\nconception offered by Anaximander is of marked interest in its bearing\\r\\nupon the development of materialism. This philosopher is remarkable for\\r\\nhaving _defined_ his first principle, instead of having chosen it from\\r\\namong the different elements already distinguished by common-sense. He\\r\\nthought the unity of nature to consist in its periodic evolution from\\r\\nand return into one infinite sum of material (\\xcf\\x84\\xe1\\xbd\\xb8 \\xe1\\xbc\\x84\\xcf\\x80\\xce\\xb5\\xce\\xb9\\xcf\\x81\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbd), which, much\\r\\nin the manner of the \"nebula\" of modern science, is conceived as both\\r\\nindeterminate in its actual state and infinitely rich in its\\r\\npotentiality. The conception of matter, the most familiar commonplace of\\r\\nscience, begins to be recognizable. It has here reached the point of\\r\\nsignifying a common substance for all tangible things, a substance that\\r\\nin its own general and omnipresent nature is without the special marks\\r\\nthat distinguish these tangible things from one another. And in so far\\r\\nthe philosophy of Anaximander is materialistic.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Corporeal Processes. Hylozoism and Mechanism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 104. But the earliest thinkers are said to be _hylozoists_, rather\\r\\nthan strict materialists, because of their failure to make certain\\r\\ndistinctions in connection with the _processes_ of matter. The term\\r\\nhylozoism unites with the conception of the formless material of the\\r\\nworld (\\xe1\\xbd\\x95\\xce\\xbb\\xce\\xb7), that of an animating power to which its formations and\\r\\ntransformations are due. Hylozoism itself was not a deliberate synthesis\\r\\nof these two conceptions, but a primitive practical tendency to\\r\\nuniversalize the conception, of life. Such \"animism\" instinctively\\r\\nassociates with an object\\'s bulk and hardness a capacity for locomotion\\r\\nand general initiative. And the material principles defined by the\\r\\nphilosophers retain this vague and comprehensive attribute as a matter\\r\\nof course, until it is distinguished and separated through attempts to\\r\\nunderstand it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat aspect of natural process which was most impressive to Greek minds\\r\\nof the reflective type was the alternation of \"generation and decay.\" In\\r\\nfull accord with his more ancient master, Epicurus, the Latin poet\\r\\nLucretius writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Thus neither can death-dealing motions keep the mastery\\r\\n     always, nor entomb existence forevermore; nor, on the other\\r\\n     hand, can the birth and increase giving motions of things\\r\\n     preserve them always after they are born. Thus the war of\\r\\n     first beginnings waged from eternity is carried on with\\r\\n     dubious issue: now here, now there, the life-bringing elements\\r\\n     of things get the mastery and are o\\'ermastered in turn: with\\r\\n     the funeral wail blends the cry which babies raise when they\\r\\n     enter the borders of light; and no night ever followed day,\\r\\n     nor morning night, that heard not, mingling with the sickly\\r\\n     infant\\'s cries, wailings of the attendants on death and black\\r\\n     funeral.\"[226:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a similar vein, the earliest conceptions of natural evolution\\r\\nattributed it to the coworking of two principles, that of Love or union\\r\\nand that of Hate or dissolution. The process is here distinguished from\\r\\nthe material of nature, but is still described in the language of\\r\\npractical life. A distinction between two aspects of vital phenomena is\\r\\nthe next step. These may be regarded in respect either of the motion and\\r\\nchange which attend them, or the rationality which informs them. Life is\\r\\nboth effective and significant. Although neither of these ideas ever\\r\\nwholly ceases to be animistic, they may nevertheless be applied quite\\r\\nindependently of one another. The one reduces the primitive animistic\\r\\nworld to the lower end of its scale, the other construes it in terms of\\r\\na purposive utility commensurable with that of human action. Now it is\\r\\nwith _mechanism_, the former of these diverging ways, that the\\r\\ndevelopment of materialism is identified. For this philosophy a thing\\r\\nneed have no value to justify its existence, nor any acting intelligence\\r\\nto which it may owe its origin. Its bulk and position are sufficient for\\r\\nits being, and the operation of forces capable of integrating, dividing,\\r\\nor moving it is sufficient for its derivation and history. In short,\\r\\nthere is no rhyme or reason at the heart of things, but only actual\\r\\nmatter distributed by sheer force. With this elimination of the element\\r\\nof purposiveness from the hylozoistic world, the content and process of\\r\\nnature are fitted to one another. Matter is that which is moved by\\r\\nforce, and force is the determining principle of the motions of matter.\\r\\nMaterialism is now definitely equipped with its fundamental conceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Materialism and Physical Science.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 105. The central conceptions of materialism as a philosophical theory\\r\\ndiffer from those employed in the physical sciences only in what is\\r\\ndemanded of them. The scientist reports upon physical phenomena without\\r\\naccepting any further responsibility, while those who like Lucretius\\r\\nmaintain a physical metaphysics, must, like him, prove that \"the minute\\r\\nbodies of matter from everlasting continually uphold the sum of things.\"\\r\\nBut, though they employ them in their own way, materialists and all\\r\\nother exponents of naturalism derive their central conceptions from the\\r\\nphysical sciences, and so reflect the historical development through\\r\\nwhich these sciences have passed. To certain historical phases of\\r\\nphysical science, in so far as these bear directly upon the meaning of\\r\\nnaturalism, we now turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Development of the Conceptions of Physical Science. Space\\r\\nand Matter.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 106. From the earliest times down to the present day the groundwork of\\r\\nmaterialism has most commonly been cast in the form of an _atomic\\r\\ntheory_. Democritus, the first system-builder of this school, adopted\\r\\nthe conception of indivisible particles (\\xe1\\xbc\\x84\\xcf\\x84\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xbc\\xce\\xbf\\xce\\xb9), impenetrable in\\r\\ntheir occupancy of space, and varying among themselves only in form,\\r\\norder, and position. To provide for the motion that distributes them he\\r\\nconceived them as separated from one another by empty space. From this\\r\\nit follows that the void is as real as matter, or, as Democritus himself\\r\\nis reputed to have said, \"thing is not more real than no-thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut atomism has not been by any means universally regarded as the most\\r\\nsatisfactory conception of the relation between space and matter. Not\\r\\nonly does it require two kinds of being, with the different attributes\\r\\nof extension and hardness, respectively,[229:3] but it would also seem\\r\\nto be experimentally inadequate in the case of the more subtle physical\\r\\nprocesses, such as light. The former of these is a speculative\\r\\nconsideration, and as such had no little weight with the French\\r\\nphilosopher Descartes, whose divisions and definitions so profoundly\\r\\naffected the course of thought in these matters after the sixteenth\\r\\ncentury. Holding also \"that a vacuum or space in which there is\\r\\nabsolutely no body is repugnant to reason,\" and that an indivisible\\r\\nspace-filling particle is self-contradictory, he was led to _identify\\r\\nspace and matter_; that is, to make matter as indispensable to space as\\r\\nspace to matter. There is, then, but one kind of corporeal being, whose\\r\\nattribute is extension, and whose modes are motion and rest. The most\\r\\nfamous application of the mechanical conceptions which he bases upon\\r\\nthis first principle, is his theory of the planets, which are conceived\\r\\nto be embedded in a transparent medium, and to move with it, vortex\\r\\nfashion, about the sun.[230:4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the conception of the space-filling continuity of material substance\\r\\nowes its prominence at the present time to the experimental hypothesis\\r\\nof _ether_. This substance, originally conceived to occupy the\\r\\nintermolecular spaces and to serve as a medium for the propagation of\\r\\nundulations, is now regarded by many physicists as replacing matter. \"It\\r\\nis the great hope of science at the present day,\" says a contemporary\\r\\nexponent of naturalism, \"that hard and heavy matter will be shown to be\\r\\nether in motion.\"[231:5] Such a theory would reduce bodies to the\\r\\nrelative displacements of parts of a continuous substance, which would\\r\\nbe first of all defined as spacial, and would possess such further\\r\\nproperties as special scientific hypotheses might require.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo broadly contrasting theories thus appear: that which defines matter\\r\\nas a continuous substance coextensive with space; and that which defines\\r\\nit as a discrete substance divided by empty space. But both theories are\\r\\nseriously affected by the peculiarly significant development of the\\r\\nconception of force.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Motion and its Cause. Development and Extension of the\\r\\nConception of Force.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 107. In the Cartesian system the cause of motion was pressure within a\\r\\nplenum. But in the seventeenth century this notion encountered the\\r\\nsystem of Newton, a system which seemed to involve action at a distance.\\r\\nIn the year 1728 Voltaire wrote from London:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When a Frenchman arrives in London, he finds a very great\\r\\n     change, in philosophy as well as in most other things. In\\r\\n     Paris he left the world all full of matter; here he finds\\r\\n     absolute vacua. At Paris the universe is seen filled up with\\r\\n     ethereal vortices, while here the same space is occupied with\\r\\n     the play of the invisible forces of gravitation. In Paris the\\r\\n     earth is painted for us longish like an egg, and in London it\\r\\n     is oblate like a melon. At Paris the pressure of the moon\\r\\n     causes the ebb and flow of tides; in England, on the other\\r\\n     hand, the sea gravitates toward the moon, so that at the same\\r\\n     time when the Parisians demand high water of the moon, the\\r\\n     gentlemen of London require an ebb.\"[232:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these differences are not matters of taste, nor even rival\\r\\nhypotheses upon an equal footing. The Newtonian system of mechanics, the\\r\\nconsummation of a development initiated by Galileo, differed from the\\r\\nvortex theory of Descartes as exact science differs from speculation and\\r\\nunverified conjecture. And this difference of method carried with it\\r\\neventually certain profound differences of content, distinguishing the\\r\\nNewtonian theory even from that of Democritus, with which it had so much\\r\\nin common. Although Democritus had sought to avoid the element of\\r\\npurposiveness in the older hylozoism by referring the motions of bodies\\r\\nas far as possible to the impact of other bodies, he nevertheless\\r\\nattributed these motions ultimately to _weight_, signifying thereby a\\r\\ncertain _downward disposition_. Now it is true that in his general\\r\\nbelief Newton himself is not free from hylozoism. He thought of the\\r\\nmotions of the planets themselves as initiated and quickened by a power\\r\\nemanating ultimately from God. They are \"impressed by an intelligent\\r\\nAgent,\" and\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"can be the effect of nothing else than the wisdom and skill\\r\\n     of a powerful ever-living Agent who, being in all places, is\\r\\n     more able by his will to move the bodies within his boundless\\r\\n     uniform _sensorium_, and thereby to form and reform the parts\\r\\n     of the universe, than we are by our will to move the parts of\\r\\n     our own bodies.\"[233:7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by the side of these statements must be set his famous disclaimer,\\r\\n\"_hypotheses non fingo_.\" In his capacity of natural philosopher he did\\r\\nnot seek to explain motions, but only to describe them. Disbelieving as\\r\\nhe did in action at a distance, he saw no possibility of explanation\\r\\nshort of a reference of them to God; but such \"hypotheses\" he thought to\\r\\nbe no proper concern of science. As a consequence, the mathematical\\r\\nformulation of motions came, through him, to be regarded as the entire\\r\\ncontent of mechanics. The notion of an efficient cause of motion is\\r\\nstill suggested by the term _force_, but even this term within the\\r\\nsystem of mechanics refers always to a definite amount of motion, or\\r\\nmeasurement of relative motion. And the same is true of _attraction_,\\r\\n_action_, _reaction_, and the like. The further explanation of motion,\\r\\nthe definition of a virtue or potency that produces it, first a\\r\\nneglected problem, then an irrelevant problem, is finally, for a\\r\\nnaturalistic philosophy in which this progression is completed, an\\r\\ninsoluble problem. For the sequel to this purely descriptive procedure\\r\\non the part of science is the disavowal of \"metaphysics\" by those who\\r\\nwill have no philosophy but science. Thus the scientific conservatism of\\r\\nNewton has led to the positivistic and agnostic phase of naturalism. But\\r\\na further treatment of this development must be reserved until the issue\\r\\nof epistemology shall have been definitely raised.\\r\\n\\r\\nA different emphasis within the general mechanical scheme, attaching\\r\\nespecial importance to the conceptions of force and energy, has led to a\\r\\nrival tendency in science and a contrasting type of naturalism. The\\r\\nmechanical hypotheses hitherto described are all of a simple and readily\\r\\ndepicted type. They suggest an imagery quite in accord with common-sense\\r\\nand with observation of the motions of great masses like the planets.\\r\\nMaterial particles are conceived to move within a containing space; the\\r\\nmotions of corpuscles, atoms, or the minute parts of ether, differing\\r\\nonly in degree from those of visible bodies. The whole physical\\r\\nuniverse may be represented in the imagination as an aggregate of bodies\\r\\nparticipating in motions of extraordinary complexity, but of one type.\\r\\nBut now let the emphasis be placed upon the determining causes rather\\r\\nthan upon the moving bodies themselves. In other words, let the bodies\\r\\nbe regarded as attributive and the forces as substantive. The result is\\r\\na radical alteration of the mechanical scheme and the transcendence of\\r\\ncommon-sense imagery. This was one direction of outgrowth from the work\\r\\nof Newton. His force of gravitation prevailed between bodies separated\\r\\nby spaces of great magnitude. Certain of the followers of Newton,\\r\\nnotably Cotes, accepting the formulas of the master but neglecting his\\r\\nallusions to the agency of God, accepted the principle of action at a\\r\\ndistance. _Force_, in short, _was conceived to pervade space of itself_.\\r\\nBut if force be granted this substantial and self-dependent character,\\r\\nwhat further need is there of matter as a separate form of entity? For\\r\\ndoes not the presence of matter consist essentially in resistance,\\r\\nitself a case of force? Such reflections as these led Boscovich and\\r\\nothers to the radical departure of defining material particles _as\\r\\ncentres of force_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Development and Extension of the Conception of Energy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 108. But a more fruitful hypothesis of the same general order is due\\r\\nto the attention directed to the conception of _energy_, or capacity for\\r\\nwork, by experimental discoveries of the possibility of reciprocal\\r\\ntransformations without loss, of motion, heat, electricity, and other\\r\\nprocesses. The principle of the conservation of energy affirms the\\r\\nquantitative constancy of that which is so transformed, measured, for\\r\\nexample, in terms of capacity to move units of mass against gravity. The\\r\\nexponents of what is called \"energetics\" have in many cases come to\\r\\nregard that the quantity of which is so conserved, as a substantial\\r\\nreality whose forms and distributions compose nature. A contemporary\\r\\nscientist, whose synthetic and dogmatic habit of mind has made him\\r\\neminent in the ranks of popular philosophy, writes as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Mechanical and chemical energy, sound and heat, light and\\r\\n     electricity, are mutually convertible; they seem to be but\\r\\n     different modes of one and the same fundamental force or\\r\\n     _energy_. Thence follows the important thesis of the unity of\\r\\n     all natural forces, or, as it may also be expressed, the\\r\\n     \\'monism of energy.\\'\"[236:8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conception of energy seems, indeed, to afford an exceptional\\r\\nopportunity to naturalism. We have seen that the matter-motion theory\\r\\nwas satisfied to ignore, or regard as insoluble, problems concerning the\\r\\nultimate causes of things. Furthermore, as we shall presently see to\\r\\nbetter advantage, the more strictly materialistic type of naturalism\\r\\nmust regard thought as an anomaly, and has no little difficulty with\\r\\nlife. But the conception of energy is more adaptable, and hence better\\r\\nqualified to serve as a common denominator for various aspects of\\r\\nexperience. The very readiness with which we can picture the corpuscular\\r\\nscheme is a source of embarrassment to the seeker after unity. That\\r\\nwhich is so distinct is bristling with incompatibilities. The most\\r\\naggressive materialist hesitates to describe thought as a motion of\\r\\nbodies in space. Energy, on the other hand, exacts little if anything\\r\\nbeyond the character of measurable power. Thought is at any rate in some\\r\\nsense a power, and to some degree measurable. Recent discoveries of the\\r\\ndependence of capacity for mental exertion upon physical vitality and\\r\\nmeasurements of chemical energy received into the system as food, and\\r\\nsomehow exhausted by the activities of thought, have lent plausibility\\r\\nto the hypothesis of a universal energy of which physical and\\r\\n\"psychical\" processes are alike manifestations. And the conception of\\r\\nenergy seems capable not only of unifying nature, but also of satisfying\\r\\nthe metaphysical demand for an efficient and moving cause. This term,\\r\\nlike \"force\" and \"power,\" is endowed with such a significance by common\\r\\nsense. Indeed, naturalism would seem here to have swung round toward its\\r\\nhylozoistic starting-point. The exponent of energetics, like the naive\\r\\nanimistic thinker, attributes to nature a power like that which he feels\\r\\nwelling up within himself. When he acts upon the environment, like meets\\r\\nlike. Energetics, it is true, may obtain a definite meaning for its\\r\\ncentral conception from the measurable behavior of external bodies, and\\r\\na meaning that may be quite free from vitalism or teleology. But in his\\r\\nextension of the conception the author of a philosophical energetics\\r\\nabandons this strict meaning, and blends his thought even with a phase\\r\\nof subjectivism, known as _panpsychism_.[238:9] This theory regards the\\r\\ninward life of all nature as homogeneous with an immediately felt\\r\\nactivity or appetency, as energetics finds the inner life to be\\r\\nhomogeneous with the forces of nature. Both owe their philosophical\\r\\nappeal to their apparent success in unifying the world upon a direct\\r\\nempirical basis, and to their provision for the practical sense of\\r\\nreality.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, in brief, are the main alternatives available for a naturalistic\\r\\ntheory of being, in consequence of the historical development of the\\r\\nfundamental conceptions of natural science.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Claims of Naturalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 109. We turn now to an examination of the manner in which naturalism,\\r\\nequipped with working principles, seeks to meet the special requirements\\r\\nof philosophy. The conception of the unity of nature is directly in the\\r\\nline of a purely scientific development, but naturalism takes the bold\\r\\nand radical step of regarding nature so unified as coextensive with the\\r\\nreal, or at any rate knowable, universe. It will be remembered that\\r\\namong the early Greeks Anaxagoras had referred the creative and\\r\\nformative processes of nature to a non-natural or rational agency, which\\r\\nhe called the _Nous_. The adventitious character of this principle, the\\r\\nexternal and almost purely nominal part which it played in the actual\\r\\ncosmology of Anaxagoras, betrayed it into the hands of the atomists,\\r\\nwith their more consistently naturalistic creed. Better, these maintain,\\r\\nthe somewhat dogmatic extension of conceptions proved to be successful\\r\\nin the description of nature, than a vague dualism which can serve only\\r\\nto distract the scientific attention and people the world with\\r\\nobscurities. There is a remarkable passage in Lucretius in which atomism\\r\\nis thus written large and inspired with cosmical eloquence:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For verily not by design did the first-beginnings of things\\r\\n     station themselves each in its right place guided by keen\\r\\n     intelligence, nor did they bargain sooth to say what motions\\r\\n     each should assume, but because many in number and shifting\\r\\n     about in many ways throughout the universe, they are driven\\r\\n     and tormented by blows during infinite time past, after trying\\r\\n     motions and unions of every kind at length they fall into\\r\\n     arrangements such as those out of which our sum of things has\\r\\n     been formed, and by which too it is preserved through many\\r\\n     great years, when once it has been thrown into the appropriate\\r\\n     motions, and causes the streams to replenish the greedy sea\\r\\n     with copious river waters, and the earth, fostered by the heat\\r\\n     of the sun, to renew its produce, and the race of living\\r\\n     things to come up and flourish, and the gliding fires of ether\\r\\n     to live: all which these several things could in no wise bring\\r\\n     to pass, unless a store of matter could rise up from infinite\\r\\n     space, out of which store they are wont to make up in due\\r\\n     season whatever has been lost.\"[240:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prophecy of La Place, the great French mathematician, voices the\\r\\nsimilar faith of the eighteenth century in a mechanical understanding\\r\\nof the universe:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The human mind, in the perfection it has been able to give to\\r\\n     astronomy, affords a feeble outline of such an intelligence.\\r\\n     Its discoveries in mechanics and in geometry, joined to that\\r\\n     of universal gravitation, have brought it within reach of\\r\\n     comprehending in the same analytical expressions the past and\\r\\n     future states of the system of the world.\"[241:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for God, the creative and presiding intelligence, La Place had \"no\\r\\nneed of any such hypothesis.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Task of Naturalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 110. But these are the boasts of Homeric heroes before going into\\r\\nbattle. The moment such a general position is assumed there arise sundry\\r\\ndifficulties in the application of naturalistic principles to special\\r\\ninterests and groups of facts. It is one thing to project a mechanical\\r\\nscheme in the large, but quite another to make explicit provision within\\r\\nit for the origin of nature, for life, for the human self with its\\r\\nideals, and for society with its institutions. The naturalistic method\\r\\nof meeting these problems involves a reduction all along the line in the\\r\\ndirection of such categories as are derived from the infra-organic\\r\\nworld. That which is not like the planetary system must be construed as\\r\\nmechanical by indirection and subtlety.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Origin of the Cosmos.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 111. The origin of the present known natural world was the first\\r\\nphilosophical question to be definitely met by science. The general form\\r\\nof solution which naturalism offers is anticipated in the most ancient\\r\\ntheories of nature. These already suppose that the observed mechanical\\r\\nprocesses of the circular or periodic type, like the revolutions and\\r\\nrotations of the stars, are incidents in a historical mechanical process\\r\\nof a larger scale. Prior to the present fixed motions of the celestial\\r\\nbodies, the whole mass of cosmic matter participated in irregular\\r\\nmotions analogous to present terrestrial redistributions. Such motions\\r\\nmay be understood to have resulted in the integration of separate\\r\\nbodies, to which they at the same time imparted a rotary motion. It is\\r\\nsuch a hypothesis that Lucretius paints in his bold, impressionistic\\r\\ncolors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the development of mechanics paved the way for a definite scientific\\r\\ntheory, the so-called \"nebular hypothesis,\" announced by La Place in\\r\\n1796, and by the philosopher Kant at a still earlier date. Largely\\r\\nthrough the Newtonian principle of the parallelogram of forces, the\\r\\npresent masses, orbits, and velocities were analyzed into a more\\r\\nprimitive process of concentration within a nebulous or highly diffused\\r\\naggregate of matter. And with the aid of the principle of the\\r\\nconservation of energy this theory appears to make possible the\\r\\nderivation of heat, light, and other apparently non-mechanical processes\\r\\nfrom the same original energy of motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a persistently philosophical mind at once raises the question of the\\r\\norigin of this primeval nebula itself, with a definite organization and\\r\\na vast potential energy that must, after all, be regarded as a part of\\r\\nnature rather than its source. Several courses are here open to\\r\\nnaturalism. It may maintain that the question of ultimate origin is\\r\\nunanswerable; it may regard such a process of concentration as extending\\r\\nback through an infinitely long past;[243:12] or, and this is the\\r\\nfavorite alternative for more constructive minds, the historical\\r\\ncosmical process may be included within a still higher type of periodic\\r\\nprocess, which is regarded as eternal. This last course has been\\r\\nfollowed in the well-known synthetic naturalism of Herbert Spencer.\\r\\n\"Evolution,\" he says, \"is the progressive integration of matter and\\r\\ndissipation of motion.\" But such a process eventually runs down, and may\\r\\nbe conceived as giving place to a counter-process of devolution which\\r\\nscatters the parts of matter and gathers another store of potential\\r\\nmotion. The two processes in alternation will then constitute a cosmical\\r\\nsystem without beginning or end.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such wise a sweeping survey of the physical universe may be thought\\r\\nin the terms of natural science. The uniformitarian method in geology,\\r\\nresolving the history of the crust of the earth into known processes,\\r\\nsuch as erosion and igneous fusion;[244:13] and spectral analysis, with\\r\\nits discoveries concerning the chemical constituents of distant bodies\\r\\nthrough the study of their light, have powerfully re\\xc3\\xabnforced this effort\\r\\nof thought, and apparently completed an outline sketch of the universe\\r\\nin terms of infra-organic processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Life. Natural Selection.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 112. But the cosmos must be made internally homogeneous in these same\\r\\nterms. There awaits solution, in the first place, the serious problem of\\r\\nthe genesis and maintenance of life within a nature that is originally\\r\\nand ultimately inorganic. The assimilation of the field of biology and\\r\\nphysiology to the mechanical cosmos had made little real progress prior\\r\\nto the nineteenth century. Mechanical theories had, indeed, been\\r\\nprojected in the earliest age of philosophy, and proposed anew in the\\r\\nseventeenth century.[245:14] Nevertheless, the structural and functional\\r\\nteleology of the organism remained as apparently irrefutable testimony\\r\\nto the inworking of some principle other than that of mechanical\\r\\nnecessity. Indeed, the only fruitful method applicable to organic\\r\\nphenomena was that which explained them in terms of purposive\\r\\nadaptation. And it was its provision for a mechanical interpretation of\\r\\nthis very principle that gave to the Darwinian _law of natural\\r\\nselection_, promulgated in 1859 in the \"Origin of Species,\" so profound\\r\\na significance for naturalism. It threatened to reduce the last\\r\\nstronghold of teleology, and completely to dispense with the intelligent\\r\\nAuthor of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarwin\\'s hypothesis sought to explain the origin of animal species by\\r\\nsurvival under competitive conditions of existence through the\\r\\npossession of a structure suited to the environment. Only the most\\r\\nelementary organism need be presupposed, together with slight variations\\r\\nin the course of subsequent generations, and both may be conceived to\\r\\narise mechanically. There will then result in surviving organisms a\\r\\ngradual accumulation of such variations as promote survival under the\\r\\nspecial conditions of the environment. Such a principle had been\\r\\nsuggested as early as the time of Empedocles, but it remained for Darwin\\r\\nto establish it with an unanswerable array of observation and\\r\\nexperimentation. If any organism whatsoever endowed with the power of\\r\\ngeneration be allowed to have somehow come to be, naturalism now\\r\\npromises to account for the whole subsequent history of organic\\r\\nphenomena and the origin of any known species.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Mechanical Physiology.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 113. But what of life itself? The question of the derivation of\\r\\norganic from inorganic matter has proved insoluble by direct means, and\\r\\nthe case of naturalism must here rest upon such facts as the chemical\\r\\nhomogeneity of these two kinds of matter, and the conformity of\\r\\nphysiological processes to more general physical laws. Organic matter\\r\\ndiffers from inorganic only through the presence of proteid, a peculiar\\r\\nproduct of known elements, which cannot be artificially produced, but\\r\\nwhich is by natural means perpetually dissolved into these elements\\r\\nwithout any discoverable residuum. Respiration may be studied as a case\\r\\nof aerodynamics, the circulation of the blood as a case of\\r\\nhydrodynamics, and the heat given off in the course of work done by the\\r\\nbody as a case of thermodynamics. And although vitalistic theories still\\r\\nretain a place in physiology, as do teleological theories in biology, on\\r\\nthe whole the naturalistic programme of a reduction of organic processes\\r\\nto the type of the inorganic tends to prevail.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Mind. The Reduction to Sensation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 114. The history of naturalism shows that, as in the case of life, so\\r\\nalso in the case of _mind_, its hypotheses were projected by the Greeks,\\r\\nbut precisely formulated and verified only in the modern period of\\r\\nscience. In the philosophy of Democritus the soul was itself an atom,\\r\\nfiner, rounder, and smoother than the ordinary, but thoroughly a part of\\r\\nthe mechanism of nature. The processes of the soul are construed as\\r\\ninteractions between the soul and surrounding objects. In sensation, the\\r\\nthing perceived produces images by means of effluxes which impinge upon\\r\\nthe soul-atom. These images are not true reports of the outer world, but\\r\\nmust be revised by thought before its real atomic structure emerges.\\r\\nFor this higher critical exercise of thought Democritus devised no\\r\\nspecial atomic genesis. The result may be expressed either as the\\r\\ninvalidity of such operations of mind as he could provide for in his\\r\\nuniverse, or the irreducibility to his chosen first principles of the\\r\\nvery thought which defined them. Later naturalism has generally\\r\\nsacrificed epistemology to cosmology, and reduced thought to sensation.\\r\\nSimilarly, will has been regarded as a highly developed case of\\r\\ninstinct. Knowledge and will, construed as sensation and instinct, may\\r\\nthus be interpreted in the naturalistic manner within the field of\\r\\nbiology.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Automatism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 115. But the actual content of sensation, and the actual feelings\\r\\nwhich attend upon the promptings of instinct, still stubbornly testify\\r\\nto the presence in the universe of something belonging to a wholly\\r\\ndifferent category from matter and motion. The attitude of naturalism in\\r\\nthis crucial issue has never been fixed and unwavering, but there has\\r\\ngradually come to predominate a method of denying to the inner life all\\r\\nefficacy and real significance in the cosmos, while admitting its\\r\\npresence on the scene. It is a strange fact of history that Descartes,\\r\\nthe French philosopher who prided himself on having rid the soul of all\\r\\ndependence on nature, should have greatly contributed to this method.\\r\\nBut it is perhaps not so strange when we consider that every dualism is,\\r\\nafter all, symmetrical, and that consequently whatever rids the soul of\\r\\nnature at the same time rids nature of the soul. It was Descartes who\\r\\nfirst conceived the body and soul to be utterly distinct substances. The\\r\\ncorollary to this doctrine was his _automatism_, applied in his own\\r\\nsystem to animals other than man, but which those less concerned with\\r\\nreligious tradition and less firmly convinced of the soul\\'s originating\\r\\nactivity were not slow to apply universally. This theory conceived the\\r\\nvital processes to take place quite regardless of any inner\\r\\nconsciousness, or even without its attendance. To this radical theory\\r\\nthe French materialists of the eighteenth century were especially\\r\\nattracted. With them the active soul of Descartes, the distinct\\r\\nspiritual entity, disappeared. This latter author had himself admitted a\\r\\ndepartment of the self, which he called the \"passions,\" in which the\\r\\ncourse and content of mind is determined by bodily conditions. Extending\\r\\nthis conception to the whole province of mind, they employed it to\\r\\ndemonstrate the thorough-going subordination of mind to body. La\\r\\nMettrie, a physician and the author of a book entitled \"L\\'Homme\\r\\nMachine,\" was first interested in this thesis by a fever delirium, and\\r\\nafterward adduced anatomical and pathological data in support of it. The\\r\\nangle from which he views human life is well illustrated in the\\r\\nfollowing:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What would have sufficed in the case of Julius C\\xc3\\xa6sar, of\\r\\n     Seneca, of Petronius, to turn their fearlessness into timidity\\r\\n     or braggartry? An obstruction in the spleen, the liver, or the\\r\\n     _vena portae_. For the imagination is intimately connected\\r\\n     with these viscera, and from them arise all the curious\\r\\n     phenomena of hypochondria and hysteria. . . . \\'A mere nothing,\\r\\n     a little fibre, some trifling thing that the most subtle\\r\\n     anatomy cannot discover, would have made two idiots out of\\r\\n     Erasmus and Fontenelle.\\'\"[250:15]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Radical Materialism. Mind as an Epiphenomenon.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 116. The extreme claim that the soul is a physical organ of the body,\\r\\nidentical with the brain, marked the culmination of this militant\\r\\nmaterialism, so good an instance of that over-simplification and\\r\\nwhole-hearted conviction characteristic of the doctrinaire propagandism\\r\\nof France. Locke, the Englishman, had admitted that possibly the\\r\\nsubstance which thinks is corporeal. In the letters of Voltaire this\\r\\nthought has already found a more positive expression:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I am body, and I think; more I do not know. Shall I then\\r\\n     attribute to an unknown cause what I can so easily attribute\\r\\n     to the only fruitful cause I am acquainted with? In fact,\\r\\n     where is the man who, without an absurd godlessness, dare\\r\\n     assert that it is impossible for the Creator to endow matter\\r\\n     with thought and feeling?\"[251:16]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, Holbach, the great systematizer of this movement, takes the\\r\\naffair out of the hands of the Creator and definitively announces that\\r\\n\"a sensitive soul is nothing but a human brain so constituted that it\\r\\neasily receives the motions communicated to it.\"[251:17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis theory has been considerably tempered since the age of Holbach.\\r\\nNaturalism has latterly been less interested in identifying the soul\\r\\nwith the body, and more interested in demonstrating its dependence upon\\r\\nspecific bodily conditions, after the manner of La Mettrie. The\\r\\nso-called higher faculties, such as thought and will, have been related\\r\\nto central or _cortical_ processes of the nervous system, processes of\\r\\nconnection and complication which within the brain itself supplement the\\r\\nimpulses and sensations congenitally and externally stimulated. The\\r\\nterm \"epiphenomenon\" has been adopted to express the distinctness but\\r\\nentire dependence of the mind. Man is \"a conscious automaton.\" The real\\r\\ncourse of nature passes through his nervous system, while consciousness\\r\\nattends upon its functions like a shadow, present but not\\r\\nefficient.[252:18]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Knowledge, Positivism and Agnosticism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 117. Holbach\\'s \"Syst\\xc3\\xa8me de la Nature,\" published in 1770, marks the\\r\\nculmination of the unequivocally materialistic form of naturalism. Its\\r\\nepistemological difficulties, always more or less in evidence, have\\r\\nsince that day sufficed to discredit materialism, and to foster the\\r\\ngrowth of a critical and apologetic form of naturalism known as\\r\\n_positivism_ or _agnosticism_. The modesty of this doctrine does not, it\\r\\nis true, strike very deep. For, although it disclaims knowledge of\\r\\nultimate reality, it also forbids anyone else to have any. Knowledge, it\\r\\naffirms, can be of but one type, that which comprises the verifiable\\r\\nlaws governing nature. All questions concerning first causes are\\r\\nfutile, a stimulus only to excursions of fancy popularly mistaken for\\r\\nknowledge. The superior certainty and stability which attaches to\\r\\nnatural science is to be permanently secured by the savant\\'s steadfast\\r\\nrefusal to be led away after the false gods of metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though this is sufficient ground for an agnostic policy, it does\\r\\nprove an agnostic theory. The latter has sprung from a closer analysis\\r\\nof knowledge, though it fails to make a very brave showing for\\r\\nthoroughness and consistency. The crucial point has already been brought\\r\\nwithin our view. The general principles of naturalism require that\\r\\nknowledge shall be reduced to sensations, or impressions of the\\r\\nenvironment upon the organism. But the environment and the sensations do\\r\\nnot correspond. The environment is matter and motion, force and energy;\\r\\nthe sensations are of motions, to be sure, but much more conspicuously\\r\\nof colors, sounds, odors, pleasures, and pains. Critically, this may be\\r\\nexpressed by saying that since the larger part of sense-perception is so\\r\\nunmistakably subjective, and since all knowledge alike must be derived\\r\\nfrom this source, knowledge as a whole must be regarded as dealing only\\r\\nwith appearances. There are at least three agnostic methods progressing\\r\\nfrom this point. All agree that the inner or essential reality is\\r\\nunfathomable. But, in the first place, those most close to the tradition\\r\\nof materialism maintain that the most significant appearances, the\\r\\nprimary qualities, are those which compose a purely quantitative and\\r\\ncorporeal world. The inner essence of things may at any rate be\\r\\n_approached_ by a monism of matter or of energy. This theory is\\r\\nepistemological only to the extent of moderating its claims in the hope\\r\\nof lessening its responsibility. Another agnosticism places all sense\\r\\nqualities on a par, but would regard physics and psychology as\\r\\ncomplementary reports upon the two distinct series of phenomena in which\\r\\nthe underlying reality expresses itself. This theory is epistemological\\r\\nto the extent of granting knowledge, viewed as perception, as good a\\r\\nstanding in the universe as that which is accorded to its object. But\\r\\nsuch a dualism tends almost irresistibly to relapse into materialistic\\r\\nmonism, because of the fundamental place of physical conceptions in the\\r\\nsystem of the sciences. Finally, in another and a more radical phase of\\r\\nagnosticism, we find an attempt to make full provision for the\\r\\nlegitimate problems of epistemology. The only datum, the only existent\\r\\naccessible to knowledge, is said to be the sensation, or state of\\r\\nconsciousness. In the words of Huxley:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What, after all, do we know of this terrible \\'matter\\' except\\r\\n     as a name for the unknown and hypothetical cause of states of\\r\\n     our own consciousness? And what do we know of that \\'spirit\\'\\r\\n     over whose threatened extinction by matter a great lamentation\\r\\n     is arising, . . . except that it is also a name for an unknown\\r\\n     and hypothetical cause, or condition, of states of\\r\\n     consciousness?\"[255:19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe physical world is now to be regarded as a construction which does\\r\\nnot assimilate to itself the content of sensations, but enables one to\\r\\nanticipate them. The sensation signifies a contact to which science can\\r\\nprovide a key for practical guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Experimentalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 118. This last phase of naturalism is an attempt to state a pure and\\r\\nconsistent experimentalism, a workable theory of the routine of\\r\\nsensations. But it commonly falls into the error of the vicious circle.\\r\\nThe hypothetical cause of sensations is said to be matter. From this\\r\\npoint of view the sensation is a complex, comprising elaborate physical\\r\\nand physiological processes. But these processes themselves, on the\\r\\nother hand, are said to be analyzable into sensations. Now two such\\r\\nmethods of analysis cannot be equally ultimate. If all of reality is\\r\\nfinally reducible to sensations, then the term sensation must be used\\r\\nin a new sense to connote a self-subsistent being, and can no longer\\r\\nrefer merely to a function of certain physiological processes. The issue\\r\\nof this would be some form of idealism or of the experience-philosophy\\r\\nthat is now coming so rapidly to the front.[256:20] But while it is true\\r\\nthat idealism has sometimes been intended, and that a radically new\\r\\nphilosophy of experience has sometimes been closely approached, those,\\r\\nnevertheless, who have developed experimentalism from the naturalistic\\r\\nstand-point have in reality achieved only a thinly disguised\\r\\nmaterialism. For _the very ground of their agnosticism is\\r\\nmaterialistic_.[256:21] Knowledge of reality itself is said to be\\r\\nunattainable, because knowledge, in order to come within the order of\\r\\nnature, must be regarded as reducible to sensation; and because\\r\\nsensation itself, when regarded as a part of nature, is only a\\r\\nphysiological process, a special phenomenon, in no way qualified to be\\r\\nknowledge that is true of reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Naturalistic Epistemology not Systematic.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 119. Perhaps, after all, it would be as fair to the spirit of\\r\\nnaturalism to relieve it of responsibility for an epistemology. It has\\r\\nnever thoroughly reckoned with this problem. It has deliberately\\r\\nselected from among the elements of experience, and been so highly\\r\\nconstructive in its method as to forfeit its claim to pure empiricism;\\r\\nand, on the other hand, has, in this same selection of categories and in\\r\\nits insistence upon the test of experiment, fallen short of a\\r\\nthorough-going rationalism. While, on the one hand, it defines and\\r\\nconstructs, it does so, on the other hand, within the field of\\r\\nperception and with constant reference to the test of perception. The\\r\\nexplanation and justification of this procedure is to be found in the\\r\\naim of natural science rather than in that of philosophy. It is this\\r\\nspecial interest, rather than the general problem of being, that\\r\\ndetermines the order of its categories. Naturalism as an account of\\r\\nreality is acceptable only so far as its success in satisfying specific\\r\\ndemands obtains for it a certain logical immunity. These demands are\\r\\nunquestionably valid and fundamental, but they are not coextensive with\\r\\nthe demand for truth. They coincide rather with the immediate practical\\r\\nneed of a formulation of the spacial and temporal changes that confront\\r\\nthe will. Hence naturalism is acceptable to common-sense as an account\\r\\nof what the every-day attitude to the environment treats as its object.\\r\\nNaturalism is common-sense about the \"outer world,\" revised and brought\\r\\nup to date with the aid of the results of science. Its deepest spring is\\r\\nthe organic instinct for the reality of the tangible, the vital\\r\\nrecognition of the significance of that which is on the plane of\\r\\ninteraction with the body.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: General Ethical Stand-point.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 120. Oddly enough, although common-sense is ready to intrust to\\r\\nnaturalism the description of the situation of life, it prefers to deal\\r\\notherwise with its ideals. Indeed, common-sense is not without a certain\\r\\nsuspicion that naturalism is the advocate of moral reversion. It is\\r\\nrecognized as the prophecy of the brute majority of life, of those\\r\\nconsiderations of expediency and pleasure that are the warrant for its\\r\\nsecular moods rather than for its sustaining ideals. And that strand of\\r\\nlife is indeed its special province. For the naturalistic method of\\r\\nreduction must find the key to human action among those practical\\r\\nconditions that are common to man and his inferiors in the scale of\\r\\nbeing. In short, human life, like all life, must be construed as the\\r\\nadjustment of the organism to its natural environment for the sake of\\r\\npreservation and economic advancement.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Cynicism and Cyrenaicism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 121. Early in Greek philosophy this general idea of life was\\r\\npicturesquely interpreted in two contrasting ways, those of the Cynic\\r\\nand the Cyrenaic. Both of these wise men postulated the spiritual\\r\\nindifference of the universe at large, and looked only to the _contact_\\r\\nof life with its immediate environment. But while the one hoped only to\\r\\nhedge himself about, the other sought confidently the gratification of\\r\\nhis sensibilities. The figure of the Cynic is the more familiar.\\r\\nDiogenes of the tub practised self-mortification until his dermal and\\r\\nspiritual callousness were alike impervious. From behind his protective\\r\\nsheath he could without affectation despise both nature and society. He\\r\\ncould reckon himself more blessed than Alexander, because, with demand\\r\\nreduced to the minimum, he could be sure of a surplus of supply. Having\\r\\nrenounced all goods save the bare necessities of life, he could neglect\\r\\nboth promises and threats and be played upon by no one. He was securely\\r\\nintrenched within himself, an unfurnished habitation, but the citadel of\\r\\na king. The Cyrenaic, on the other hand, did not seek to make impervious\\r\\nthe surface of contact with nature and society, but sought to heighten\\r\\nits sensibility, that it might become a medium of pleasurable feeling.\\r\\nFor the inspiration with which it may be pursued this ideal has nowhere\\r\\nbeen more eloquently set forth than in the pages of Walter Pater, who\\r\\nstyles himself \"the new Cyrenaic.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the\\r\\n     end. A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a\\r\\n     variegated, dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is\\r\\n     to be seen in them by the finest senses? How shall we pass\\r\\n     most swiftly from point to point, and be present always at the\\r\\n     focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their\\r\\n     purest energy?\\r\\n\\r\\n     To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this\\r\\n     ecstacy, is success in life. . . . While all melts under our\\r\\n     feet, we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any\\r\\n     contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to\\r\\n     set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the\\r\\n     senses, strange dyes, strange colors, and curious odors, or\\r\\n     work of the artist\\'s hands, or the face of one\\'s friend. Not\\r\\n     to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those\\r\\n     about us, and in the brilliancy of their gifts some tragic\\r\\n     dividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short day of\\r\\n     frost and sun, to sleep before evening.\"[261:22]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Development of Utilitarianism. Evolutionary Conception of\\r\\nSocial Relations.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 122. In the course of modern philosophy the ethics of naturalism has\\r\\nundergone a transformation and development that equip it much more\\r\\nformidably for its competition with rival theories. If the Cynic and\\r\\nCyrenaic philosophies of life seem too egoistic and narrow in outlook,\\r\\nthis inadequacy has been largely overcome through the modern conception\\r\\nof the relation of the individual to society. Man is regarded as so\\r\\ndependent upon social relations that it is both natural and rational for\\r\\nhim to govern his actions with a concern for the community. There was a\\r\\ntime when this relation of dependence was viewed as external, a barter\\r\\nof goods between the individual and society, sanctioned by an implied\\r\\ncontract. Thomas Hobbes, whose unblushing materialism and egoism\\r\\nstimulated by opposition the whole development of English ethics,\\r\\nconceived morality to consist in rules of action which condition the\\r\\nstability of the state, and so secure for the individual that \"peace\"\\r\\nwhich self-interest teaches him is essential to his welfare.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And therefore so long a man is in the condition of mere\\r\\n     nature, which is a condition of war, as private appetite is\\r\\n     the measure of good and evil: and consequently all men agree\\r\\n     on this, that peace is good, and therefore also the ways or\\r\\n     means of peace, which, as I have showed before, are \\'justice,\\'\\r\\n     \\'gratitude,\\' \\'modesty,\\' \\'equity,\\' \\'mercy,\\' and the rest of\\r\\n     the laws of Nature, are good; that is to say, \\'moral virtues\\';\\r\\n     and their contrary \\'vices,\\' evil.\"[262:23]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy Bentham, the apostle of utilitarianism in the eighteenth century,\\r\\ndefined political and social sanctions through which the individual\\r\\ncould purchase security and good repute with action conducive to the\\r\\ncommon welfare. But the nineteenth century has understood the matter\\r\\nbetter--and the idea of an evolution under conditions that select and\\r\\nreject, is here again the illuminating thought. No individual,\\r\\nevolutionary naturalism maintains, has survived the perils of life\\r\\nwithout possessing as an inalienable part of his nature, congenital like\\r\\nhis egoism, certain impulses and instinctive desires in the interest of\\r\\nthe community as a whole. The latest generation of a race whose\\r\\nperpetuation has been conditioned by a capacity to sustain social\\r\\nrelations and make common cause against a more external environment,\\r\\n_is_ moral, and does not adopt morality in the course of a calculating\\r\\negoism. Conscience is the racial instinct of self-preservation uttering\\r\\nitself in the individual member, who draws his very life-blood from the\\r\\ngreater organism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Naturalistic Ethics not Systematic.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 123. This latest word of naturalistic ethics has not won acceptance\\r\\nas the last word in ethics, and this in spite of its indubitable truth\\r\\nwithin its scope. For the deeper ethical interest seeks not so much to\\r\\naccount for the moral nature as to construe and justify its promptings.\\r\\nThe evolutionary theory reveals the genesis of conscience, and\\r\\ndemonstrates its continuity with nature, but this falls as far short of\\r\\nrealizing the purpose of ethical study as a history of the natural\\r\\ngenesis of thought would fall short of logic. Indeed, naturalism shows\\r\\nhere, as in the realm of epistemology, a persistent failure to\\r\\nappreciate the central problem. Its acceptance as a philosophy, we are\\r\\nagain reminded, can be accounted for only on the score of its genuinely\\r\\nrudimentary character. As a rudimentary phase of thought it is both\\r\\nindispensable and inadequate. It is the philosophy of instinct, which\\r\\nshould in normal development precede a philosophy of reason, in which it\\r\\nis eventually assimilated and supplemented.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Naturalism as Antagonistic to Religion.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 124. There is, finally, an inspiration for life which this philosophy\\r\\nof naturalism may convey--atheism, its detractors would call it, but\\r\\nnone the less a faith and a spiritual exaltation that spring from its\\r\\nsumming up of truth. It is well first to realize that which is\\r\\ndispiriting in it, its failure to provide for the freedom, immortality,\\r\\nand moral providence of the more sanguine faith.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For what is man looked at from this point of view? . . . Man,\\r\\n     so far as natural science by itself is able to teach us, is no\\r\\n     longer the final cause of the universe, the Heaven-descended\\r\\n     heir of all the ages.

He would\\r\\nhave men look for a deep spring of life in the negative idea of mystery,\\r\\nthe apotheosis of ignorance, while religious faith to live at all must\\r\\nlay hold upon reality.

When, in the year 1710, Bishop Berkeley maintained the thesis of\\r\\nempirical idealism, having rediscovered it and announced it with a\\r\\njustifiable sense of originality, he provoked a kind of critical\\r\\njudgment that was keenly annoying if not entirely surprising to him. In\\r\\nrefuting the conception of material substance and demonstrating the\\r\\ndependence of being upon mind, he at once sought, as he did repeatedly\\r\\nin later years, to establish the world of practical belief, and so to\\r\\nreconcile metaphysics and common-sense. Yet he found himself hailed as a\\r\\nfool and a sceptic. In answer to an inquiry concerning the reception of\\r\\nhis book in London, his friend Sir John Percival wrote as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I did but name the subject matter of your book of\\r\\n     _Principles_ to some ingenious friends of mine and they\\r\\n     immediately treated it with ridicule, at the same time\\r\\n     refusing to read it, which I have not yet got one to do. A\\r\\n     physician of my acquaintance undertook to discover your\\r\\n     person, and argued you must needs be mad, and that you ought\\r\\n     to take remedies. A bishop pitied you, that a desire of\\r\\n     starting something new should put you upon such an\\r\\n     undertaking. Another told me that you are not gone so far as\\r\\n     another gentleman in town, who asserts not only that there is\\r\\n     no such thing as Matter, but that we ourselves have no being\\r\\n     at all.\"[268:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere can be no doubt but that the idea of the dependence of real things\\r\\nupon their appearance to the individual is a paradox to common-sense. It\\r\\nis a paradox because it seems to reverse the theoretical instinct\\r\\nitself, and to define the real in those very terms which disciplined\\r\\nthought learns to neglect. In the early history of thought the nature of\\r\\nthe thinker himself is recognized as that which is likely to distort\\r\\ntruth rather than that which conditions it. When the wise man, the\\r\\ndevotee of truth, first makes his appearance, his authority is\\r\\nacknowledged because he has renounced himself. As witness of the\\r\\nuniversal being he purges himself of whatever is peculiar to his own\\r\\nindividuality, or even to his human nature. In the aloofness of his\\r\\nmeditation he escapes the cloud of opinion and prejudice that obscures\\r\\nthe vision of the common man. In short, the element of belief dependent\\r\\nupon the thinker himself is the dross which must be refined away in\\r\\norder to obtain the pure truth. When, then, in the critical epoch of the\\r\\nGreek sophists, Protagoras declares that there is no belief that is not\\r\\nof this character, his philosophy is promptly recognized as scepticism.\\r\\nProtagoras argues that sense qualities are clearly dependent upon the\\r\\nactual operations of the senses, and that all knowledge reduces\\r\\nultimately to these terms.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The senses are variously named hearing, seeing, smelling;\\r\\n     there is the sense of heat, cold, pleasure, pain, desire,\\r\\n     fear, and many more which are named, as well as innumerable\\r\\n     others which have no name; _with each of them there is born an\\r\\n     object of sense_,--all sorts of colors born with all sorts of\\r\\n     sight and sounds in like manner with hearing, and other\\r\\n     objects with the other senses.\"[269:3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the objects are \"born with\" the senses, it follows that they are born\\r\\nwith and appertain to the individual perceiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Either show, if you can, that our sensations are not\\r\\n     relative and individual, or, if you admit that they are\\r\\n     individual, prove that this does not involve the consequence\\r\\n     that the appearance becomes, or, if you like to say, is to the\\r\\n     individual only.\"[270:4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same motif is thus rendered by Walter Pater in the Conclusion of his\\r\\n\"Renaissance\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"At first sight experience seems to bury us under a flood of\\r\\n     external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and\\r\\n     importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand\\r\\n     forms of action. But when reflexion begins to act upon those\\r\\n     objects they are dissipated under its influence; the cohesive\\r\\n     force seems suspended like a trick of magic; each object is\\r\\n     loosed into a group of impressions--color, odor, texture--in\\r\\n     the mind of the observer. . . . Experience, already reduced to\\r\\n     a swarm of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by\\r\\n     that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has\\r\\n     ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can\\r\\n     only conjecture to be without. Every one of these impressions\\r\\n     is the impression of the individual in his isolation, each\\r\\n     mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Protagorean generalization is due to the reflection that all\\r\\nexperience is some individual experience, that no subject of discourse\\r\\nescapes the imputation of belonging to some individual\\'s private\\r\\nhistory. The individual must start with his own experiences and ideas,\\r\\nand he can never get beyond them, for he cannot see outside his own\\r\\nvision, or even think outside his own mind. The scepticism of this\\r\\ntheory is explicit, and the formulas of Protagoras--the famous \"_Man is\\r\\nthe measure of all things_,\" and the more exact formula, \"_The truth is\\r\\nwhat appears to each man at each time_\"[271:5]--have been the articles\\r\\nof scepticism throughout the history of thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Phenomenalism and Spiritualism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 127. There is, therefore, nothing really surprising in the reception\\r\\naccorded the \"new philosophy\" of Bishop Berkeley. A sceptical relativism\\r\\nis the earliest phase of subjectivism, and its avoidance at once becomes\\r\\nthe most urgent problem of any philosophy which proposes to proceed\\r\\nforth from this principle. And this problem Berkeley meets with great\\r\\nadroitness and a wise recognition of difficulties. But his sanguine\\r\\ntemperament and speculative interest impel him to what he regards as the\\r\\nextension of his first principle, the reintroduction of the conception\\r\\nof substance under the form of spirit, and of the objective order of\\r\\nnature under the form of the mind of God. In short, there are two\\r\\nmotives at work in him, side by side: the epistemological motive,\\r\\nrestricting reality to perceptions and thoughts, and the\\r\\nmetaphysical-religious motive, leading him eventually to the definition\\r\\nof reality in terms of perceiving and thinking spirits. And from the\\r\\ntime of Berkeley these two principles, _phenomenalism_ and\\r\\n_spiritualism_, have remained as distinct and alternating phases of\\r\\nsubjectivism. The former is its critical and dialectical conception, the\\r\\nlatter its constructive and practical conception.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Phenomenalism as Maintained by Berkeley. The Problem\\r\\nInherited from Descartes and Locke.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 128. As _phenomenalism_ has its classic statement and proof in the\\r\\nwritings of Berkeley, we shall do well to return to these. The fact that\\r\\nthis philosopher wished to be regarded as the prophet of common-sense\\r\\nhas already been mentioned. This purpose reveals itself explicitly in\\r\\nthe series of \"Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous.\" The form in which\\r\\nBerkeley here advances his thesis is further determined by the manner in\\r\\nwhich the lines were drawn in his day of thought. The world of\\r\\nenlightened public opinion was then threefold, consisting of God,\\r\\nphysical nature, and the soul. In the early years of the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury Descartes had sharply distinguished between the two\\r\\nsubstances--mind, with its attribute of thought; and body, with its\\r\\nattribute of extension--and divided the finite world between them. God\\r\\nwas regarded as the infinite and sustaining cause of both. Stated in the\\r\\nterms of epistemology, the object of clear thinking is the physical\\r\\ncosmos, the subject of clear thinking the immortal soul. The realm of\\r\\nperception, wherein the mind is subjected to the body, embarrasses the\\r\\nCartesian system, and has no clear title to any place in it. And without\\r\\nattaching cognitive importance to this realm, the system is utterly\\r\\ndogmatic in its epistemology.[273:6] For what one substance thinks, must\\r\\nbe assumed to be somehow true of another quite independent substance\\r\\nwithout any medium of communication. Now between Descartes and Berkeley\\r\\nappeared the sober and questioning \"Essay Concerning Human\\r\\nUnderstanding,\" by John Locke. This is an interesting combination (they\\r\\ncannot be said to blend) of traditional metaphysics and revolutionary\\r\\nepistemology. The universe still consists of God, the immortal thinking\\r\\nsoul, and a corporeal nature, the object of its thought. But, except for\\r\\ncertain proofs of God and self, knowledge is entirely reduced to the\\r\\nperceptual type, to sensations, or ideas directly imparted to the mind\\r\\nby the objects themselves. To escape dogmatism it is maintained that\\r\\nthe real is what is _observed to be present_. But Locke thinks the\\r\\nqualities so discovered belong in part to the perceiver and in part to\\r\\nthe substance outside the mind. Color is a case of the former, a\\r\\n\"secondary quality\"; and extension a case of the latter, a \"primary\\r\\nquality.\" And evidently the above empirical test of knowledge is not\\r\\nequally well met in these two cases. When I see a red object I know that\\r\\nred exists, for it is observed to be present, and I make no claim for it\\r\\nbeyond the present. But when I note that the red object is square, I am\\r\\nsupposed to know a property that will continue to exist in the object\\r\\nafter I have closed my eyes or turned to something else. Here my claim\\r\\nexceeds my observation, and the empirical principle adopted at the\\r\\noutset would seem to be violated. Berkeley develops his philosophy from\\r\\nthis criticism. His refutation of material substance is intended as a\\r\\nfull acceptance of the implications of the new empirical epistemology.\\r\\nKnowledge is to be all of the perceptual type, where what is known is\\r\\ndirectly presented; and, in conformity with this principle, being is to\\r\\nbe restricted to the content of the living pulses of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Refutation of Material Substance.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 129. Berkeley, then, beginning with the threefold world of Descartes\\r\\nand of common-sense, proposes to apply Locke\\'s theory of knowledge to\\r\\nthe discomfiture of corporeal nature. It was a radical doctrine, because\\r\\nit meant for him and for his contemporaries the denial of all finite\\r\\nobjects outside the mind. But at the same time it meant a restoration of\\r\\nthe homogeneity of experience, the re\\xc3\\xabstablishment of the qualitative\\r\\nworld of every-day living, and so had its basis of appeal to\\r\\ncommon-sense. The encounter between Hylas, the advocate of the\\r\\ntraditional philosophy, and Philonous, who represents the author\\r\\nhimself, begins with an exchange of the charge of innovation.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Hyl._ I am glad to find there was nothing in the accounts I\\r\\n     heard of you.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Phil._ Pray, what were those?\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Hyl._ You were represented, in last night\\'s conversation, as\\r\\n     one who maintained the most extravagant opinion that ever\\r\\n     entered into the mind of man, to wit, that there is no such\\r\\n     thing as _material substance_ in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Phil._ That there is no such thing as what _philosophers_\\r\\n     call _material substance_, I am seriously persuaded: but if I\\r\\n     were made to see anything absurd or sceptical in this, I\\r\\n     should then have the same reason to renounce this that I\\r\\n     imagine I have now to reject the contrary opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Hyl._ What! can anything be more fantastical, more repugnant\\r\\n     to Common-Sense, or a more manifest piece of Scepticism, than\\r\\n     to believe there is no such thing as _matter_?\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Phil._ Softly, good Hylas. What if it should prove that you,\\r\\n     who hold there is, are, by virtue of that opinion, a greater\\r\\n     sceptic, and maintain more paradoxes and repugnances to\\r\\n     Common-Sense, than I who believe no such thing?[276:7]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilonous now proceeds with his case. Beginning by obtaining from Hylas\\r\\nthe admission that pleasure and pain are essentially relative and\\r\\nsubjective, he argues that sensations such as heat, since they are\\r\\ninseparable from these feelings, must be similarly regarded. And he is\\r\\nabout to annex other qualities in turn to this core of subjectivity,\\r\\nwhen Hylas enters a general demurrer:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Hold, Philonous, I now see what it was deluded me all this\\r\\n     time. You asked me whether heat and cold, sweetness and\\r\\n     bitterness, were not particular sorts of pleasure and pain; to\\r\\n     which I answered simply that they were. Whereas I should have\\r\\n     thus distinguished:--those qualities as perceived by us, are\\r\\n     pleasures or pains; but not as existing in the external\\r\\n     objects. We must not therefore conclude absolutely, that there\\r\\n     is no heat in the fire, or sweetness in the sugar, but only\\r\\n     that heat or sweetness, as perceived by us, are not in the\\r\\n     fire or sugar.\"[276:8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Application of the Epistemological Principle.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 130. Here the argument touches upon profound issues. Philonous now\\r\\nassumes the extreme empirical contention _that knowledge applies only to\\r\\nits own psychological moment, that its object in no way extends beyond\\r\\nthat individual situation which we call the state of knowing_. The full\\r\\nimport of such an epistemology Berkeley never recognized, but he is\\r\\nclearly employing it here, and the overthrow of Hylas is inevitable so\\r\\nlong as he does not challenge it or turn it against his opponent. This,\\r\\nhowever, as a protagonist of Berkeley\\'s own making, he fails to do, and\\r\\nhe plays into Philonous\\'s hands by admitting that what is known only in\\r\\nperception must for that reason _consist_ in perception. He frankly owns\\r\\n\"that it is vain to stand out any longer,\" that \"colors, sounds, tastes,\\r\\nin a word, all those termed _secondary qualities_, have certainly no\\r\\nexistence without the mind.\"[277:9]\\r\\n\\r\\nHylas has now arrived at the distinction between primary and secondary\\r\\nqualities. \"Extension, Figure, Solidity, Gravity, Motion, and Rest\" are\\r\\nthe attributes of an external substance which is the cause of\\r\\nsensations. But the same epistemological principle readily reduces these\\r\\nalso to dependence on mind, for, like the secondary qualities, their\\r\\ncontent is given only in perception. Hylas is then driven to defend a\\r\\ngeneral material substratum, which is the cause of ideas, but to which\\r\\nnone of the definite content of these ideas can be attributed. In short,\\r\\nhe has put all the content of knowledge on the one side, and admitted\\r\\nits inseparability from the perceiving spirit, and left the being of\\r\\nthings standing empty and forlorn on the other. This amounts, as\\r\\nPhilonous reminds him, to the denial of the reality of the known world.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"You are therefore, by your principles, forced to deny the\\r\\n     _reality_ of sensible things; since you made it to consist in\\r\\n     an absolute existence exterior to the mind. That is to say,\\r\\n     you are a downright sceptic. So I have gained my point, which\\r\\n     was to show your principles led to Scepticism.\"[278:10]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Refutation of a Conceived Corporeal World.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 131. Having advanced the direct empiricist argument for phenomenalism,\\r\\nBerkeley now gives the rationalistic motive an opportunity to express\\r\\nitself in the queries of Hylas as to whether there be not an \"absolute\\r\\nextension,\" somehow abstracted by thought from the relativities of\\r\\nperception. Is there not at least a _conceivable_ world independent of\\r\\nperception?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answers of Philonous throw much light upon the Berkeleyan position.\\r\\nHe admits that thought is capable of separating the primary from the\\r\\nsecondary qualities in certain _operations_, but at the same time denies\\r\\nthat this is forming an idea of them as separate.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I acknowledge, Hylas, it is not difficult to form general\\r\\n     propositions and reasonings about those qualities, without\\r\\n     mentioning any other; and, in this sense, to consider or treat\\r\\n     of them abstractedly. But, how doth it follow that, because I\\r\\n     can pronounce the word _motion_ by itself, I can form the idea\\r\\n     of it in my mind exclusive of body? or, because theorems may\\r\\n     be made of extension and figures, without any mention of\\r\\n     _great_ or _small_, or any other sensible mode or quality,\\r\\n     that therefore it is possible such an abstract idea of\\r\\n     extension, without any particular size or figure, or sensible\\r\\n     quality, should be distinctly formed, and apprehended by the\\r\\n     mind? Mathematicians treat of quantity, without regarding what\\r\\n     other sensible qualities it is attended with, as being\\r\\n     altogether indifferent to their demonstrations. But, when\\r\\n     laying aside the words, they contemplate the bare ideas, I\\r\\n     believe you will find, they are not the pure abstracted ideas\\r\\n     of extension.\"[279:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBerkeley denies that we have ideas of pure extension or motion, because,\\r\\nalthough we do actually _deal_ with these and find them intelligible, we\\r\\ncan never obtain a state of mind in which they appear as the content. He\\r\\napplies this psychological test because of his adherence to the general\\r\\nempirical postulate that knowledge is limited to the individual content\\r\\nof its own individual states. \"It is a universally received maxim,\" he\\r\\nsays, \"that _everything which exists is particular_.\" Now the truth of\\r\\nmathematical reckoning is not particular, but is valid wherever the\\r\\nconditions to which it refers are fulfilled. Mathematical reckoning, if\\r\\nit is to be particular, must be regarded as a particular act or state of\\r\\nsome thinker. Its truth must then be construed as relative to the\\r\\ninterests of the thinker, as a symbolism which has an instrumental\\r\\nrather than a purely cognitive value. This conclusion cannot be disputed\\r\\nshort of a radical stand against the general epistemological principle\\r\\nto which Berkeley is so far true, the principle that the reality which\\r\\nis known in any state of thinking or perceiving is the state itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Transition to Spiritualism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 132. This concludes the purely phenomenalistic strain of Berkeley\\'s\\r\\nthought. He has taken the immediate apprehension of sensible objects in\\r\\na state of mind centring about the pleasure and pain of an individual,\\r\\nto be the norm of knowledge. He has further maintained that knowledge\\r\\ncannot escape the particularity of its own states. The result is that\\r\\nthe universe is composed of private perceptions and ideas. Strictly on\\r\\nthe basis of what has preceded, Hylas is justified in regarding this\\r\\nconclusion as no less sceptical than that to which his own position had\\r\\nbeen reduced; for while he had been compelled to admit that the real is\\r\\nunknowable, Philonous has apparently defined the knowable as relative to\\r\\nthe individual. But the supplementary metaphysics which had hitherto\\r\\nbeen kept in the background is now revealed. It is maintained that\\r\\nthough perceptions know no external world, they do nevertheless reveal a\\r\\nspiritual substance of which they are the states. Although it has\\r\\nhitherto been argued that the _esse_ of things is in their _percipi_,\\r\\nthis is now replaced by the more fundamental principle that the _esse_\\r\\nof things is in their _percipere_ or _velle_. The real world consists\\r\\nnot in perceptions, but in perceivers.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Further Attempts to Maintain Phenomenalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 133. Now it is at once evident that the epistemological theory which\\r\\nhas been Berkeley\\'s dialectical weapon in the foregoing argument is no\\r\\nlonger available. And those who have cared more for this theory than for\\r\\nmetaphysical speculation have attempted to stop at this point, and so to\\r\\nconstrue phenomenalism as to make it self-sufficient on its own\\r\\ngrounds. Such attempts are so instructive as to make it worth our while\\r\\nto review them before proceeding with the development of the\\r\\nspiritualistic motive in subjectivism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is to be regarded as made up of sense-perceptions, ideas, or\\r\\nphenomena. What is to be accepted as the fundamental category which\\r\\ngives to all of these terms their subjectivistic significance? So far\\r\\nthere seems to be nothing in view save the principle of relativity. The\\r\\ntype to which these were reduced was that of the peculiar or unsharable\\r\\nexperience best represented by an individual\\'s pleasure and pain. But\\r\\nrelativity will not work as a general principle of being. It consigns\\r\\nthe individual to his private mind, and cannot provide for the validity\\r\\nof knowledge enough even to maintain itself. Some other course, then,\\r\\nmust be followed. Perception may be given a psycho-physical definition,\\r\\nwhich employs physical terms as fundamental;[282:12] but this flagrantly\\r\\ncontradicts the phenomenalistic first principle. Or, reality may be\\r\\nregarded as so stamped with its marks as to insure the proprietorship of\\r\\nthought. But this definition of certain objective entities of mind, of\\r\\nbeings attributed to intelligence because of their intrinsic\\r\\nintelligibility, is inconsistent with empiricism, if indeed it does not\\r\\nlead eventually to a realism of the Platonic type.[283:13] Finally, and\\r\\nmost commonly, the terms of phenomenalism have been retained after their\\r\\noriginal meaning has been suffered to lapse. The \"impressions\" of Hume,\\r\\n_e. g._, are the remnant of the Berkeleyan world with the spirit\\r\\nstricken out. There is no longer any point in calling them impressions,\\r\\nfor they now mean only elements or qualities. As a consequence this\\r\\noutgrowth of the Berkeleyanism epistemology is at present merging into a\\r\\nrealistic philosophy of experience.[283:14] Any one, then, of these\\r\\nthree may be the last state of one who undertakes to remain exclusively\\r\\nfaithful to the phenomenalistic aspect of Berkeleyanism, embodied in the\\r\\nprinciple _esse est percipi_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Berkeley\\'s Spiritualism. Immediate Knowledge of the\\r\\nPerceiver.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 134. Let us now follow the fortunes of the other phase of\\r\\nsubjectivism--that which develops the conception of the perceiver rather\\r\\nthan the perceived. When Berkeley holds that\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"all the choir of heaven and furniture of the Earth, in a\\r\\n     word, all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the\\r\\n     world, have not any subsistence without a Mind,\"\\r\\n\\r\\nhis thought has transcended the epistemology with which he overthrew the\\r\\nconception of material substance, in two directions. For neither mind of\\r\\nthe finite type nor mind of the divine type is perceived. But the first\\r\\nof these may yet be regarded as a direct empirical datum, even though\\r\\nsharply distinguished from an object of perception. In the third\\r\\ndialogue, Philonous thus expounds this new kind of knowledge:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I own I have properly no _idea_, either of God or any other\\r\\n     spirit; for these being active, cannot be represented by\\r\\n     things perfectly inert, as our ideas are. I do nevertheless\\r\\n     know that I, who am a spirit or thinking substance, exist as\\r\\n     certainly as I know my ideas exist. Farther, I know what I\\r\\n     mean by the terms _I_ and _myself_; and I know this\\r\\n     immediately or intuitively, though I do not perceive it as I\\r\\n     perceive a triangle, a color, or a sound.\"[284:15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe knowledge here provided for may be regarded as empirical because\\r\\nthe reality in question is an individual present in the moment of the\\r\\nknowledge. Particular acts of perception are said directly to reveal not\\r\\nonly perceptual objects, but perceiving subjects. And the conception of\\r\\nspiritual substance, once accredited, may then be extended to account\\r\\nfor social relations and to fill in the nature of God. The latter\\r\\nextension, in so far as it attributes such further predicates as\\r\\nuniversality and infinity, implies still a third epistemology, and\\r\\nthreatens to pass over into rationalism. But the knowledge of one\\'s\\r\\nfellow-men may, it is claimed, be regarded as immediate, like the\\r\\nknowledge of one\\'s self. Perceptual and volitional activity has a sense\\r\\nfor itself and also a sense for other like activity. The self is both\\r\\nself-conscious and socially conscious in an immediate experience of the\\r\\nsame type.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Schopenhauer\\'s Spiritualism, or Voluntarism. Immediate\\r\\nKnowledge of the Will.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 135. But this general spiritualistic conception is developed with less\\r\\nsingleness of purpose in Berkeley than among the _voluntarists_ and\\r\\n_panpsychists_ who spring from Schopenhauer, the orientalist, pessimist,\\r\\nand mystic among the German Kantians of the early nineteenth century.\\r\\nHis great book, \"Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,\" opens with the\\r\\nphenomenalistic contention that \"the world is my idea.\" It soon appears,\\r\\nhowever, that the \"my\" is more profoundly significant than the \"idea.\"\\r\\nNature is my creation, due to the working within me of certain fixed\\r\\nprinciples of thought, such as space, time, and causality. But nature,\\r\\njust because it is my creation, is less than me: is but a manifestation\\r\\nof the true being for which I must look _within_ myself. But this inner\\r\\nself cannot be made an object of thought, for that would be only to\\r\\ncreate another term of nature. The will itself, from which such creation\\r\\nsprings, is \"that which is most immediate\" in one\\'s consciousness, and\\r\\n\"makes itself known in a direct manner in its particular acts.\" The term\\r\\n_will_ is used by Schopenhauer as a general term covering the whole\\r\\ndynamics of life, instinct and desire, as well as volition. It is that\\r\\nsense of life-preserving and life-enhancing appetency which is the\\r\\nconscious accompaniment of struggle. With its aid the inwardness of the\\r\\nwhole world may now be apprehended.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whoever has now gained from all these expositions a knowledge\\r\\n     _in abstracto_, and therefore clear and certain, of what\\r\\n     everyone knows directly _in concreto_, _i. e._, as feeling, a\\r\\n     knowledge that his will is the real inner nature of his\\r\\n     phenomenal being, . . . and that his will is that which is\\r\\n     most immediate in his consciousness, . . . will find that of\\r\\n     itself it affords him the key to the knowledge of the inmost\\r\\n     being of the whole of nature; for he now transfers it to all\\r\\n     those phenomena which are not given to him, like his own\\r\\n     phenomenal existence, both in direct and indirect knowledge,\\r\\n     but only in the latter, thus merely one-sidedly as _idea_\\r\\n     alone.\"[287:16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heart of reality is thus known by an \"intuitive interpretation,\"\\r\\nwhich begins at home in the individual\\'s own heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Panpsychism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 136. The panpsychist follows the same course of reflection. There is\\r\\nan outwardness and an inwardness of nature, corresponding to the\\r\\nknower\\'s body on the one hand, and his feeling or will on the other.\\r\\nWith this principle in hand one may pass down the whole scale of being\\r\\nand discover no breach of continuity. Such an interpretation of nature\\r\\nhas been well set forth by a contemporary writer, who quotes the\\r\\nfollowing from the botanist, C. v. Naegeli:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Sensation is clearly connected with the reflex actions of\\r\\n     higher animals. We are obliged to concede it to the other\\r\\n     animals also, and we have no grounds for denying it to plants\\r\\n     and inorganic bodies. The sensation arouses in us a condition\\r\\n     of comfort and discomfort. In general, the feeling of\\r\\n     pleasure arises when the natural impulses are satisfied, the\\r\\n     feeling of pain when they are not satisfied. Since all\\r\\n     material processes are composed of movements of molecules and\\r\\n     elementary atoms, pleasure and pain must have their seat in\\r\\n     these particles. . . . Thus the same mental thread runs\\r\\n     through all material phenomena. The human mind is nothing but\\r\\n     the highest development on our earth of the mental processes\\r\\n     which universally animate and move nature.\"[288:17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to panpsychism, then, physical nature is the manifestation of\\r\\nan _appetency or bare consciousness generalized from the thinker\\'s\\r\\nawareness of his most intimate self_. Such appetency or bare\\r\\nconsciousness is the essential or substantial state of that which\\r\\nappears as physical nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Inherent Difficulty in Spiritualism. No Provision for\\r\\nObjective Knowledge.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 137. We must now turn to the efforts which this doctrine has made to\\r\\nmaintain itself against the sceptical trend of its own epistemology. For\\r\\nprecisely as in the case of phenomenalism its dialectical principle\\r\\nthreatens to be self-destructive. Immediate presence is still the test\\r\\nof knowledge. But does not immediate presence connote relativity and\\r\\ninadequacy, at best; an initial phase of knowledge that must be\\r\\nsupplemented and corrected before objective reality and valid truth are\\r\\napprehended? Does not the individuality of the individual thinker\\r\\nconnote the very maximum of error? Indeed, spiritualism would seem to\\r\\nhave exceeded even Protagoreanism itself, and to have passed from\\r\\nscepticism to deliberate nihilism. The object of knowledge is no longer\\r\\neven, as with the phenomenalist, the thinker\\'s thought, but only his\\r\\n_thinking_. And if the thinker\\'s thought is relative to him, then the\\r\\nthinker\\'s act of thinking is the very vanishing-point of relativity, the\\r\\nnegative term of a negating relation. How is a real, a self-subsistent\\r\\nworld to be composed of such? Impelled by a half-conscious realization\\r\\nof the hopelessness of this situation, the exponent of spiritualism has\\r\\nsought to universalize his conception; to define an _absolute or\\r\\nultimate spirit_ other than the individual thinker, though known in and\\r\\nthrough him. But it is clear that this development of spiritualism, like\\r\\nall of the speculative procedure of subjectivism, threatens to exceed\\r\\nthe scope of the original principle of knowledge. There is a strong\\r\\npresumption against the possibility of introducing a knowledge of God by\\r\\nthe way of the particular presentations of an individual consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Schopenhauer\\'s Attempt to Universalize Subjectivism.\\r\\nMysticism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 138. Schopenhauer must be credited with a genuine effort to accept the\\r\\nmetaphysical consequences of his epistemology. His epistemology, as we\\r\\nhave seen, defined knowledge as centripetal. The object of real\\r\\nknowledge is identical with the subject of knowledge. If I am to know\\r\\nthe universal will, therefore, I must in knowing become that will. And\\r\\nthis Schopenhauer maintains. The innermost heart of the individual into\\r\\nwhich he may retreat, even from his private will, is--the universal. But\\r\\nthere is another way of arriving at the same knowledge. In contemplation\\r\\nI may become absorbed in principles and laws, rather than be diverted by\\r\\nthe particular spacial and temporal objects, until (and this is\\r\\npeculiarly true of the \\xc3\\xa6sthetic experience) my interest no longer\\r\\ndistinguishes itself, but coincides with truth. In other words, abstract\\r\\nthinking and pure willing are not opposite extremes, but adjacent points\\r\\non the deeper or transcendent circle of experience. One may reach this\\r\\npart of the circle by moving in either of two directions that at the\\r\\nstart are directly opposite: by turning in upon the subject or by\\r\\nutterly giving one\\'s self up to the object. Reality obtains no\\r\\ndefinition by this means. Philosophy, for Schopenhauer, is rather a\\r\\nprogramme for realizing the state in which I will the universal and know\\r\\nthe universal will. The final theory of knowledge, then, is mysticism,\\r\\nreality directly apprehended in a supreme and incommunicable experience,\\r\\ndirect and vivid, like perception, and at the same time universal, like\\r\\nthought. But the empiricism with which Schopenhauer began, the appeal to\\r\\na familiar experience of self as will, has meanwhile been forgotten. The\\r\\nidea as object of my perception, and the will as its subject were in the\\r\\nbeginning regarded as common and verifiable items of experience. But\\r\\nwho, save the occasional philosopher, knows a universal will? Nor have\\r\\nattempts to avoid mysticism, while retaining Schopenhauer\\'s first\\r\\nprinciple, been successful. Certain voluntarists and panpsychists have\\r\\nattempted to do without the universal will, and define the world solely\\r\\nin terms of the many individual wills. But, as Schopenhauer himself\\r\\npointed out, individual wills cannot be distinguished except in terms of\\r\\nsomething other than will, such as space and time. The same is true if\\r\\nfor will there be substituted inner feeling or consciousness. Within\\r\\nthis category individuals can be distinguished only as points of view,\\r\\nwhich to be comparable at all must contain common objects, or be\\r\\ndefined in terms of a system of relations like that of the physical\\r\\nworld or that of an ethical community. The conception of pure will or\\r\\npure feeling inevitably attaches to itself that of an undivided unity,\\r\\nif for no other reason because there is no ground for distinction. And\\r\\nsuch a unity, a will or consciousness that is no particular act or idea,\\r\\ncan be known only in the unique experience which mysticism provides.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Objective Spiritualism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 139. The way of Schopenhauer is the way of one who adheres to the\\r\\nbelief that what the thinker knows must always be a part of himself, his\\r\\nstate or his activity. From this point of view the important element of\\r\\nbeing, its very essence or substance, is not any definable nature but an\\r\\nimmediate relation to the knower. The consequence is that the universe\\r\\nin the last analysis can only be defined as a supreme state or activity\\r\\ninto which the individual\\'s consciousness may develop. Spiritualism has,\\r\\nhowever, other interests, interests which may be quite independent of\\r\\nepistemology. It is speculatively interested in a kind of being which it\\r\\ndefines as spiritual, and in terms of which it proposes to define the\\r\\nuniverse. Such procedure is radically different from the\\r\\nepistemological criticism which led Berkeley to maintain that the\\r\\n_esse_ of objects is in their _percipi_, or Schopenhauer to maintain\\r\\nthat \"the world is my idea,\" or that led both of these philosophers to\\r\\nfind a deeper reality in immediately intuited self-activity. For now it\\r\\nis proposed to _understand_ spirit, discover its properties, and to\\r\\nacknowledge it only where these properties appear. I may now know spirit\\r\\nas an object; which in its properties, to be sure, is quite different\\r\\nfrom matter, but which like matter is capable of subsisting quite\\r\\nindependently of my knowledge. This is a metaphysical spiritualism quite\\r\\ndistinct from epistemological spiritualism, and by no means easily made\\r\\nconsistent therewith. Indeed, it exhibits an almost irrepressible\\r\\ntendency to overstep the bounds both of empiricism and subjectivism, an\\r\\nhistorical connection with which alone justifies its introduction in the\\r\\npresent chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Berkeley\\'s Conception of God as Cause, Goodness and Order.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 140. To return again to the instructive example of Bishop Berkeley, we\\r\\nfind him proving God from the evidence of him in experience, or the need\\r\\nof him to support the claims of experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"But, whatever power I may have over my own thoughts, I find\\r\\n     the ideas actually perceived by Sense have not a like\\r\\n     dependence on _my_ will. When in broad daylight I open my\\r\\n     eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or\\r\\n     no, or to determine what particular objects shall present\\r\\n     themselves to my view: and so likewise as to the hearing and\\r\\n     other senses; the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of\\r\\n     _my_ will. There is therefore some other Will or Spirit that\\r\\n     produces them.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The ideas of Sense are more strong, lively, and distinct than\\r\\n     those of the Imagination; they have likewise a steadiness,\\r\\n     order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those\\r\\n     which are the effects of human wills often are, but in a\\r\\n     regular train or series--the admirable connection whereof\\r\\n     sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its\\r\\n     Author. Now the set rules, or established methods, wherein the\\r\\n     Mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of Sense, are called\\r\\n     _the laws of nature_.\"[294:18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the attributes of experience here in question, independence or\\r\\n\"steadiness\" is not regarded as _prima facie_ evidence of spirit, but\\r\\nrather as an aspect of experience for which some cause is necessary. But\\r\\nit is assumed that the power to \"produce,\" with which such a cause must\\r\\nbe endowed, is the peculiar prerogative of spirit, and that this cause\\r\\ngives further evidence of its spiritual nature, of its eminently\\r\\nspiritual nature, in the orderliness and the goodness of its effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The force that produces, the intellect that orders, the\\r\\n     goodness that perfects all things is the Supreme\\r\\n     Being.\"[294:19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat spirit is possessed of causal efficacy, Berkeley has in an earlier\\r\\npassage proved by a direct appeal to the individual\\'s sense of power.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I find I can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure, and vary\\r\\n     and shift the scene as oft as I think fit. It is no more than\\r\\n     _willing_, and straightway this or that idea arises in my\\r\\n     fancy; and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way\\r\\n     for another. This making and unmaking of ideas doth very\\r\\n     properly denominate the mind active. Thus much is certain and\\r\\n     grounded on experience: but when we talk of unthinking agents,\\r\\n     or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition, we only amuse\\r\\n     ourselves with words.\"[295:20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Berkeley is here in general agreement with a very considerable\\r\\nvariety of philosophical views, it will be readily observed that this\\r\\ndoctrine tends to lapse into mysticism whenever it is retained in its\\r\\npurity. Berkeley himself admitted that there was no \"idea\" of such\\r\\npower. And philosophers will as a rule either obtain an idea\\r\\ncorresponding to a term or amend the term--always excepting the mystical\\r\\nappeal to an inarticulate and indefinable experience. Hence pure power\\r\\nrevealed in an ineffable immediate experience tends to give place to\\r\\nkinds of power to which some definite meaning may be attached. The\\r\\nenergy of physics, defined by measurable quantitative equivalence, is a\\r\\ncase in point. The idealistic trend is in another direction, power\\r\\ncoming to signify ethical or logical connection. Similarly, in the later\\r\\nphilosophy of Berkeley himself, God is known by the nature of his\\r\\nactivity rather than by the fact of his activity; and we are said \"to\\r\\naccount for a thing, when we show that it is so best.\" God\\'s power, in\\r\\nshort, becomes indistinguishable from his universality attended with the\\r\\nattributes of goodness and orderliness. But this means that the analogy\\r\\nof the human spirit, conscious of its own activity, is no longer the\\r\\nbasis of the argument. By the divine will is now meant ethical\\r\\nprinciples, rather than the \"here am I willing\" of the empirical\\r\\nconsciousness. Similarly the divine mind is defined in terms of logical\\r\\nprinciples, such as coherence and order, rather than in terms of the\\r\\n\"here am I thinking\" of the finite knower himself. But enough has been\\r\\nsaid to make it plain that this is no longer the stand-point of\\r\\nempirio-idealism. Indeed, in his last philosophical writing, the\\r\\n\"Siris,\" Berkeley is so far removed from the principles of knowledge\\r\\nwhich made him at once the disciple and the critic of Locke, as to\\r\\npronounce himself the devotee of Platonism and the prophet of\\r\\ntranscendentalism. The former strain appears in his conclusion that\\r\\n\"the _principles_ of science are neither objects of sense nor\\r\\nimagination; and that intellect and reason are alone the sure guides to\\r\\ntruth.\"[297:21] His transcendentalism appears in his belief that such\\r\\nprinciples, participating in the vital unity of the Individual Purpose,\\r\\nconstitute the meaning and so the substantial essence of the universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The General Tendency of Subjectivism to Transcend Itself.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 141. Such then are the various paths which lead from subjectivism to\\r\\nother types of philosophy, demonstrating the peculiar aptitude of the\\r\\nformer for departing from its first principle. Beginning with the\\r\\nrelativity of all knowable reality to the individual knower, it\\r\\nundertakes to conceive reality in one or the other of the terms of this\\r\\nrelation, as particular state of knowledge or as individual subject of\\r\\nknowledge. But these terms develop an intrinsic nature of their own, and\\r\\nbecome respectively _empirical datum_, and _logical_ or _ethical\\r\\nprinciple_. In either case the subjectivistic principle of knowledge has\\r\\nbeen abandoned. Those whose speculative interest in a definable\\r\\nobjective world has been less strong than their attachment to this\\r\\nprinciple, have either accepted the imputation of scepticism, or had\\r\\nrecourse to the radical epistemological doctrine of mysticism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Ethical Theories. Relativism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 142. Since the essence of subjectivism is epistemological rather than\\r\\nmetaphysical, its practical and religious implications are various. The\\r\\nethical theories which are corollary to the tendencies expounded above,\\r\\nrange from extreme egoism to a mystical universalism. The close\\r\\nconnection between the former and relativism is evident, and the form of\\r\\negoism most consistent with epistemological relativism is to be found\\r\\namong those same Sophists who first maintained this latter doctrine. If\\r\\nwe may believe Plato, the Sophists sought to create for their individual\\r\\npupils an _appearance_ of good. In the \"Theaetetus,\" Socrates is\\r\\nrepresented as speaking thus on behalf of Protagoras:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no\\r\\n     existence; but I say that the wise man is he who makes the\\r\\n     evils which are and appear to a man, into goods which are and\\r\\n     appear to him. . . . I say that they (the wise men) are the\\r\\n     physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen of\\r\\n     plants--for the husbandmen also take away the evil and\\r\\n     disordered sensations of plants, and infuse into them good and\\r\\n     healthy sensations as well as true ones; and the wise and good\\r\\n     rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil seem just to\\r\\n     states; for whatever appears to be just and fair to a state,\\r\\n     while sanctioned by a state, is just and fair to it; but the\\r\\n     teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the\\r\\n     evil, both in appearance and in reality.\"[299:22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs truth is indistinguishable from the appearance of truth to the\\r\\nindividual, so good is indistinguishable from a particular seeming good.\\r\\nThe supreme moral value according to this plan of life is the agreeable\\r\\nfeeling tone of that dream world to which the individual is forever\\r\\nconsigned. The possible perfection of an experience which is \"reduced to\\r\\na swarm of impressions,\" and \"ringed round\" for each one of us by a\\r\\n\"thick wall of personality\" has been brilliantly depicted in the passage\\r\\nalready quoted from Walter Pater, in whom the naturalistic and\\r\\nsubjectivistic motives unite.[299:23] If all my experience is strictly\\r\\nmy own, then my good must likewise be my own. And if all of my\\r\\nexperience is valid only in its instants of immediacy, then my best good\\r\\nmust likewise consist in some \"exquisite passion,\" or stirring of the\\r\\nsenses.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Pessimism and Self-denial.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 143. But for Schopenhauer the internal world opens out into the\\r\\nboundless and unfathomable sea of the universal will. If I retire from\\r\\nthe world upon my own private feelings, I am still short of the true\\r\\nlife, for I am asserting myself against the world. I should seek a sense\\r\\nof unison with a world whose deeper heart-beats I may learn to feel and\\r\\nadopt as the rhythm of my own. The folly of willing for one\\'s private\\r\\nself is the ground of Schopenhauer\\'s pessimism.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"All _willing_ arises from want, therefore from deficiency,\\r\\n     and therefore from suffering. The satisfaction of a wish ends\\r\\n     it; yet for one wish that is satisfied there remain at least\\r\\n     ten which are denied. Further, the desire lasts long, the\\r\\n     demands are infinite; the satisfaction is short and scantily\\r\\n     measured out. But even the final satisfaction is itself only\\r\\n     apparent; every satisfied wish at once makes room for a new\\r\\n     one, both are illusions; the one is known to be so, the other\\r\\n     not yet. No attained object of desire can give lasting\\r\\n     satisfaction, but merely a fleeting gratification; it is like\\r\\n     the alms thrown to the beggar, that keeps him alive to-day\\r\\n     that his misery may be prolonged till the morrow. . . . The\\r\\n     subject of willing is thus constantly stretched on the\\r\\n     revolving wheel of Ixion, pours water into the sieve of the\\r\\n     Danaids, is the ever-longing Tantalus.\"[300:24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe escape from this torture and self-deception is possible through the\\r\\nsame mystical experience, the same blending with the universe that\\r\\nconditions knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Ethics of Welfare.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 144. But though pleasant dreaming be the most consistent practical\\r\\nsequel to a subjectivistic epistemology, its _individualism_ presents\\r\\nanother basis for life with quite different possibilities of emphasis.\\r\\nIt may develop into an aggressive egoism of the type represented by the\\r\\nsophist Thrasymachus, in his proclamation that \"might is right, justice\\r\\nthe interest of the stronger.\"[301:25] But more commonly it is tempered\\r\\nby a conception of social interest, and serves as the champion of action\\r\\nagainst contemplation. The gospel of action is always individualistic.\\r\\nIt requires of the individual a sense of his independence, and of the\\r\\nreal virtue of his initiative. Hence those voluntarists who emphasize\\r\\nthe many individual wills and decline to reduce them, after the manner\\r\\nof Schopenhauer, to a universal, may be said to afford a direct\\r\\njustification of it. It is true that this practical realism threatens\\r\\nthe tenability of an epistemological idealism, but the two have been\\r\\nunited, and because of their common emphasis upon the individual such\\r\\nprocedure is not entirely inconsequential. Friedrich Paulsen, whose\\r\\npanpsychism has already been cited, is an excellent case in point. The\\r\\nonly good, he maintains, is \"welfare,\" the fulfilment of those natural\\r\\ndesires which both distinguish the individual and signify his\\r\\ncontinuity with all grades of being.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The goal at which the will aims does not consist in a maximum\\r\\n     of pleasurable feelings, but in the normal exercise of the\\r\\n     vital functions for which the species is predisposed. In the\\r\\n     case of man the mode of life is on the whole determined by the\\r\\n     nature of the historical unity from which the individual\\r\\n     evolves as a member. Here the objective content of life, after\\r\\n     which the will strives, also enters into consciousness with\\r\\n     the progressive evolution of presentation; the type of life\\r\\n     becomes a conscious ideal of life.\"[302:26]\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, contrary to the teaching of Schopenhauer, the good consists in\\r\\nindividual attainment, the extension and fulfilment of the _distinct_\\r\\ninterests that arise from the common fund of nature. To be and to do to\\r\\nthe uttermost, to realize the maximum from nature\\'s investment in one\\'s\\r\\nspecial capacities and powers--this is indeed the first principle of a\\r\\nmorality of action.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Ethical Community.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 145. But a type of ethics still further removed from the initial\\r\\nrelativism has been adopted and more or less successfully assimilated by\\r\\nsubjectivistic philosophies. Accepting Berkeley\\'s spirits, with their\\r\\nindefinite capacities, and likewise the stability of the ideal\\r\\nprinciples that underlie a God-administered world, and morality becomes\\r\\nthe obedience which the individual renders to the law. The individual,\\r\\nfree to act in his own right, co\\xc3\\xb6perates with the purposes of the\\r\\ngeneral spiritual community, whose laws are worthy of obedience though\\r\\nnot coercive. The recognition of such a spiritual citizenship, entailing\\r\\nopportunities, duties, and obligations, rather than thraldom, partakes\\r\\nof the truth as well as the inadequacy of common-sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Religion of Mysticism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 146. As for religion, at least two distinct practical appreciations of\\r\\nthe universe have been historically associated with this chapter in\\r\\nphilosophy. The one of these is the mysticism of Schopenhauer, the\\r\\nreligious sequel to a universalistic voluntarism. Schopenhauer\\'s ethics,\\r\\nhis very philosophy, is religion. For the good and the true are alike\\r\\nattainable only through identification with the Absolute Will. This\\r\\nconsummation of life, transcending practical and theoretical\\r\\ndifferences, engulfing and effacing all qualities and all values, is\\r\\nlike the Nirv\\xc3\\xa2na of the Orient--a positive ideal only for one who has\\r\\nappraised the apparent world at its real value.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Rather do we freely acknowledge that what remains after the\\r\\n     entire abolition of will is for all those who are still full\\r\\n     of will certainly nothing; but, conversely, to those in whom\\r\\n     the will has turned and has denied itself, this our world,\\r\\n     which is so real, with all it\\'s suns and milky-ways--is\\r\\n     nothing.\"[304:27]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Religion of Individual Co\\xc3\\xb6peration with God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 147. From the union of the two motives of voluntarism and\\r\\nindividualism springs another and a more familiar type of religion, that\\r\\nof co\\xc3\\xb6perative spiritual endeavor. In the religion of Schopenhauer the\\r\\nsoul must utterly lose itself for the sake of peace; here the soul must\\r\\npersist in its own being and activity for the sake of the progressive\\r\\ngoodness of the world. For Schopenhauer God is the universal solution,\\r\\nin which all motions cease and all differences disappear; here God is\\r\\nthe General of moral forces. The deeper and more significant universe is\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"a society of rational agents, acting under the eye of\\r\\n     Providence, concurring in one design to promote the common\\r\\n     benefit of the whole, and conforming their actions to the\\r\\n     established laws and order of the Divine parental wisdom:\\r\\n     wherein each particular agent shall not consider himself\\r\\n     apart, but as the member of a great City, whose author and\\r\\n     founder is God: in which the civil laws are no other than the\\r\\n     rules of virtue and the duties of religion: and where\\r\\n     everyone\\'s true interest is combined with his duty.\"[304:28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so uncompromising an optimism is not essential to this religion.\\r\\nIts distinction lies rather in its acceptance of the manifest plurality\\r\\nof souls, and its appeal to the faith that is engendered by\\r\\nservice.[305:29] As William James has said:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Even God\\'s being is sacred from ours. To co\\xc3\\xb6perate with his\\r\\n     creation by the best and rightest response seems all he wants\\r\\n     of us. In such co\\xc3\\xb6peration with his purposes, not in any\\r\\n     chimerical speculative conquest of him, not in any theoretical\\r\\n     drinking of him up, must lie the real meaning of our\\r\\n     destiny.\"[305:30]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[267:1] PRELIMINARY NOTE.

No one has understood better than the philosopher himself that he\\r\\ncannot hope to be popular with men of practical common-sense. Indeed, it\\r\\nhas commonly been a matter of pride with him. The classic representation\\r\\nof the philosopher\\'s faith in himself is to be found in Plato\\'s\\r\\n\"Republic.\" The philosopher is there portrayed in the famous cave simile\\r\\nas one who having seen the light itself can no longer distinguish the\\r\\nshadows which are apparent to those who sit perpetually in the twilight.\\r\\nWithin the cave of shadows he is indeed less at his ease than those who\\r\\nhave never seen the sun. But since he knows the source of the shadows,\\r\\nhis knowledge surrounds that of the shadow connoisseurs. And his\\r\\nequanimity need not suffer from the contempt of those whom he\\r\\nunderstands better than they understand themselves. The history of\\r\\nphilosophy is due to the dogged persistence with which the philosopher\\r\\nhas taken himself seriously and endured the poor opinion of the world.\\r\\nBut the pride of the philosopher has done more than perpetuate the\\r\\nphilosophical outlook and problem; it has led to the formulation of a\\r\\ndefinite philosophical conception, and of two great philosophical\\r\\ndoctrines. The conception is that of the _absolute_; and the doctrines\\r\\nare that of the _absolute being_, and that of the _absolute self_ or\\r\\n_mind_. The former of these doctrines is the topic of the present\\r\\nchapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the early Greeks the r\\xc3\\xb4le of the philosopher was one of\\r\\nsuperlative dignity. In point of knowledge he was less easily satisfied\\r\\nthan other men. He thought beyond immediate practical problems, devoting\\r\\nhimself to a profounder reflection, that could not but induce in him a\\r\\nsense of superior intellectual worth. The familiar was not binding upon\\r\\nhim, for his thought was emancipated from routine and superficiality.\\r\\nFurthermore his intellectual courage and resolution did not permit him\\r\\nto indulge in triviality, doubt, or paradox. He sought his own with a\\r\\nfaith that could not be denied. Even Heraclitus the Dark, who was also\\r\\ncalled \"the Weeping Philosopher,\" because he found at the very heart of\\r\\nnature that transiency which the philosophical mind seeks to escape,\\r\\nfelt himself to be exalted as well as isolated by that insight. But this\\r\\nsentiment of personal aloofness led at once to a division of experience.\\r\\nHe who knows truly belongs to another and more abiding world. As there\\r\\nis a philosophical way of thought, there is a philosophical way of life,\\r\\nand _a philosophical object_. Since the philosopher and the common man\\r\\ndo not see alike, the terms of their experience are incommensurable. In\\r\\nParmenides the Eleatic this motive is most strikingly exhibited. There\\r\\nis a _Way of Truth_ which diverges from the _Way of Opinion_. The\\r\\nphilosopher walks the former way alone. And there is an object of truth,\\r\\naccessible only to one who takes this way of truth. Parmenides finds\\r\\nthis object to be the content of pure affirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"One path only is left for us to speak of, namely, that _It\\r\\n     is_. In it are very many tokens that what is, is uncreated and\\r\\n     indestructible, alone, complete, immovable, and without end.\\r\\n     Nor was it ever, nor will it be; for now _it is_, all at once,\\r\\n     a continuous one.\"[308:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe philosophy of Parmenides, commonly called the Eleatic Philosophy,\\r\\nis notable for this emergence of the pure concept of _absolute being_ as\\r\\nthe final object of knowledge. The philosopher aims to discover that\\r\\nwhich is, and so turns away from that which is not or that which ceases\\r\\nto be. The negative and transient aspects of experience only hinder him\\r\\nin his search for the eternal. It was the great Eleatic insight to\\r\\nrealize that the outcome of thought is thus predetermined; that the\\r\\nanswer to philosophy is contained in the question of philosophy. The\\r\\nphilosopher, in that he resolutely avoids all partiality, relativity,\\r\\nand superficiality, must affirm a complete, universal, and ultimate\\r\\nbeing as the very object of that perfect knowledge which he means to\\r\\npossess. This object is known in the history of these philosophies as\\r\\nthe _infinite_ or _absolute_.[309:3]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Eleatic Conception of Being.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 149. The Eleatic reasons somewhat as follows. The philosopher seeks to\\r\\nknow what is. The object of his knowledge will then contain as its\\r\\nprimary and essential predicate, that of being. It is a step further to\\r\\n_define_ being in terms of this essential predicate.\\r\\n\\r\\nParmenides thinks of being as a power or strength, a positive\\r\\nself-maintenance to which all affirmations refer. The remainder of the\\r\\nEleatic philosophy is the analysis of this concept and the proof of its\\r\\nimplications. Being must persist through all change, and span all\\r\\nchasms. Before being there can be only nothing, which is the same as to\\r\\nsay that so far as being is concerned there is no before. Similarly\\r\\nthere can be no after or beyond. There can be no motion, change, or\\r\\ndivision of being, because being will be in all parts of every division,\\r\\nand in all stages of every process. Hence being is \"uncreated and\\r\\nindestructible, alone, complete, immovable, and without end.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument turns upon the application to being as a whole of the\\r\\nmeaning and the implications of _only being_. Being is the affirmative\\r\\nor positive. From that _alone_, one can derive only such properties as\\r\\neternity or unity. For generation and decay and plurality may belong to\\r\\nthat which is _also_ affirmative and positive, but not to that which is\\r\\naffirmative and positive _only_. The Eleatic philosophy is due, then, to\\r\\nthe determination to derive the whole of reality from the bare necessity\\r\\nof being, to cut down reality to what flows entirely from the assertion\\r\\nof its only known necessary aspect, that of being. We meet here in its\\r\\nsimplest form a persistent rationalistic motive, the attempt to derive\\r\\nthe universe from the isolation and analysis of its most universal\\r\\ncharacter. As in the case of every well-defined philosophy, this motive\\r\\nis always attended by a \"besetting\" problem. Here it is the accounting\\r\\nfor what, empirically at least, is alien to that universal character.\\r\\nAnd this difficulty is emphasized rather than resolved by Parmenides in\\r\\nhis designation of a limbo of opinion, \"in which is no true belief at\\r\\nall,\" to which the manifold of common experience with all its\\r\\nirrelevancies can be relegated.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Spinoza\\'s Conception of Substance.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 150. The Eleatic philosophy, enriched and supplemented, appears many\\r\\ncenturies later in the rigorous rationalism of Spinoza.[311:4] With\\r\\nSpinoza philosophy is a demonstration of necessities after the manner of\\r\\ngeometry. Reality is to be set forth in theorems derived from\\r\\nfundamental axioms and definitions. As in the case of Parmenides, these\\r\\nnecessities are the implications of the very problem of being. The\\r\\nphilosopher\\'s problem is made to solve itself. But for Spinoza that\\r\\nproblem is more definite and more pregnant. The problematic being must\\r\\nnot only be, but must be _sufficient to itself_. What the philosopher\\r\\nseeks to know is primarily an intrinsic entity. Its nature must be\\r\\nindependent of other natures, and my knowledge of it independent of my\\r\\nknowledge of anything else. Reality is something which need not be\\r\\nsought further. So construed, being is in Spinoza\\'s philosophy termed\\r\\n_substance_. It will be seen that to define substance is to affirm the\\r\\nexistence of it, for substance is so defined as to embody the very\\r\\nqualification for existence. Whatever exists exists under the form of\\r\\nsubstance, as that \"which is in itself, and is conceived through itself:\\r\\nin other words, that of which a conception can be formed independently\\r\\nof any other conception.\"[312:5]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Spinoza\\'s Proof of God, the Infinite Substance. The Modes and\\r\\nthe Attributes.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 151. There remains but one further fundamental thesis for the\\r\\nestablishment of the Spinozistic philosophy, the thesis which maintains\\r\\nthe exclusive existence of the one \"absolutely infinite being,\" or God.\\r\\nThe exclusive existence of God follows from his existence, because of\\r\\nthe exhaustiveness of his nature. His is the nature \"consisting in\\r\\ninfinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite\\r\\nessentiality.\" He will contain all meaning, and all possible meaning,\\r\\nwithin his fixed and necessary constitution. It is evident that if such\\r\\na God exist, nothing can fall outside of him. One such substance must be\\r\\nthe only substance. But upon what grounds are we to assert God\\'s\\r\\nexistence?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo proceed further with Spinoza\\'s philosophy we must introduce two terms\\r\\nwhich are scarcely less fundamental in his system than that of\\r\\nsubstance. The one of these is \"attribute,\" by which he means _kind_ or\\r\\ngeneral property; the other is \"mode,\" by which he means _case_ or\\r\\nindividual thing. Spinoza\\'s proof of God consists in showing that no\\r\\nsingle mode, single attribute, or finite group of modes or attributes,\\r\\ncan be a substance; but only an infinite system of all modes of all\\r\\nattributes. Translated into common speech this means that neither kinds\\r\\nnor cases, nor special groups of either, can stand alone and be of\\r\\nthemselves, but only the unity of all possible cases of all possible\\r\\nkinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument concerning the possible substantiality of the case or\\r\\nindividual thing is relatively simple. Suppose an attribute or kind,\\r\\n_A_, of which there are cases _am_{1}, _am_{2}, _am_{3}, etc. The\\r\\nnumber of cases is never involved in the nature of the kind, as is seen\\r\\nfor example in the fact that the definition of triangle prescribes no\\r\\nspecial number of individual triangles. Hence _am_{1}, _am_{2},\\r\\n_am_{3}, etc., must be explained by something outside of their nature.\\r\\nTheir being cases of _A_ does not account for their existing severally.\\r\\nThis is Spinoza\\'s statement of the argument that individual events, such\\r\\nas motions or sensations, are not self-dependent, but belong to a\\r\\ncontext of like events which are mutually dependent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of the attribute is more difficult. Why may not an\\r\\nattribute as a complete domain of interdependent events, itself be\\r\\nindependent or substantial? Spinoza\\'s predecessor, Descartes, had\\r\\nmaintained precisely that thesis in behalf of the domain of thought and\\r\\nthe domain of space. Spinoza\\'s answer rests upon the famous ontological\\r\\nargument, inherited from scholasticism and generally accepted in the\\r\\nfirst period of modern philosophy. The evidence of existence, he\\r\\ndeclares, is clear and distinct conceivability.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For a person to say that he has a clear and distinct--that\\r\\n     is, a true--idea of a substance, but that he is not sure\\r\\n     whether such substance exists, would be the same as if he said\\r\\n     that he had a true idea, but was not sure whether or no it was\\r\\n     false.\"[314:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we can form a clear and distinct idea of an absolutely infinite\\r\\nbeing that shall have all possible attributes. This idea is a\\r\\nwell-recognized standard and object of reference for thought. But it is\\r\\na conception which is highly qualified, not only through its clearness\\r\\nand distinctness, but also through its abundance of content. It affirms\\r\\nitself therefore with a certainty that surpasses any other certainty,\\r\\nbecause it is supported by each and every other certainty, and even by\\r\\nthe residuum of possibility. If any intelligible meaning be permitted to\\r\\naffirm itself, so much the more irresistible is the claim of this\\r\\ninfinitely rich meaning. Since every attribute contributes to its\\r\\nvalidity, the being with infinite attributes is infinitely or absolutely\\r\\nvalid. The conclusion of the argument is now obvious. If the being\\r\\nconstituted by the infinite attributes exists, it swallows up all\\r\\npossibilities and exists exclusively.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Limits of Spinoza\\'s Argument for God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 152. The vulnerable point in Spinoza\\'s argument can thus be expressed:\\r\\nthat which is important is questionable, and that which is\\r\\nunquestionable is of doubtful importance. Have I indeed a clear and\\r\\ndistinct idea of an absolutely infinite being? The answer turns upon the\\r\\nmeaning of the phrase \"idea of.\" It is true I can add to such meaning\\r\\nas I apprehend the thought of possible other meaning, and suppose the\\r\\nwhole to have a definiteness and systematic unity like that of the\\r\\ntriangle. But such an idea is problematic. I am compelled to use the\\r\\nterm \"possible,\" and so to confess the failure of definite content to\\r\\nmeasure up to my idea. My idea of an absolutely infinite being is like\\r\\nmy idea of a universal language: I can think _of_ it, but I cannot\\r\\n_think it out_, for lack of data or because of the conflicting testimony\\r\\nof other data. If I mean the infinity of my being to be a term of\\r\\ninclusiveness, and to insist that the all must be, and that there can be\\r\\nnothing not included in the all, I can scarcely be denied. But it is\\r\\nreasonable to doubt the importance of such a truth. If, on the other\\r\\nhand, I mean that my infinite being shall have the compactness and\\r\\norganic unity of a triangle, I must admit that such a being is indeed\\r\\nproblematic. The degree to which the meaning of the part is dependent\\r\\nupon the meaning of the whole, or the degree to which the geometrical\\r\\nanalogy is to be preferred to the analogy of aggregates, like the events\\r\\nwithin a year, is a problem that falls quite outside Spinoza\\'s\\r\\nfundamental arguments.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Spinoza\\'s Provision for the Finite.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 153. But the advance of Spinoza over the Eleatics must not be lost\\r\\nsight of. The modern philosopher has so conceived being as to provide\\r\\nfor parts within an individual unity. The geometrical analogy is a most\\r\\nilluminating one, for it enables us to understand how manyness may be\\r\\nindispensable to a being that is essentially unitary. The triangle as\\r\\ntriangle is one. But it could not be such without sides and angles. The\\r\\nunity is equally necessary to the parts, for sides and angles of a\\r\\ntriangle could not be such without an arrangement governed by the nature\\r\\ntriangle. The whole of nature may be similarly conceived: as the\\r\\nreciprocal necessity of _natura naturans_, or nature defined in respect\\r\\nof its unity, and _natura naturata_, or nature specified in detail.\\r\\nThere is some promise here of a reconciliation of the _Way of Opinion_\\r\\nwith the _Way of Truth_. Opinion would be a gathering of detail, truth a\\r\\ncomprehension of the intelligible unity. Both would be provided for\\r\\nthrough the consideration that whatever is complete and necessary must\\r\\nbe made up of incompletenesses that are necessary to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Transition to Teleological Conceptions.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 154. This consideration, however, does not receive its most effective\\r\\nformulation in Spinoza. The isolation of the parts, the actual\\r\\nseveralty and irrelevance of the modes, still presents a grave problem.\\r\\nIs there a kind of whole to which not only parts but fragments, or parts\\r\\nin their very incompleteness, are indispensable? This would seem to be\\r\\ntrue of a _progression_ or _development_, since that would require both\\r\\nperfection as its end, and degrees of imperfection as its stages.\\r\\nSpinoza was prevented from making much of this idea by his rejection of\\r\\nthe principle of _teleology_. He regarded appreciation or valuation as a\\r\\nprojection of personal bias. \"Nature has no particular goal in view,\"\\r\\nand \"final causes are mere human figments.\" \"The perfection of things is\\r\\nto be reckoned only from their own nature and power.\"[318:7] The\\r\\nphilosophical method which Spinoza here repudiates, the interpretation\\r\\nof the world in moral terms, is _Platonism_, an independent and\\r\\nprofoundly important movement, belonging to the same general realistic\\r\\ntype with Eleaticism and Spinozism. Absolute being is again the\\r\\nfundamental conception. Here, however, it is conceived that being is\\r\\nprimarily not affirmation or self-sufficiency, but the _good_ or\\r\\n_ideal_. There are few great metaphysical systems that have not been\\r\\ndeeply influenced by Platonism; hence the importance of understanding it\\r\\nin its purity. To this end we must return again to the early Greek\\r\\nconception of the philosopher; for Platonism, like Eleaticism, is a\\r\\nsequel to the philosopher\\'s self-consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Early Greek Philosophers not Self-critical.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 155. Although the first Greek philosophers, such men as Thales,\\r\\nHeraclitus, Parmenides, and Empedocles, were clearly aware of their\\r\\ndistinction and high calling, it by no means follows that they were good\\r\\njudges of themselves. Their sense of intellectual power was\\r\\nunsuspecting; and they praised philosophy without definitely raising the\\r\\nquestion of its meaning. They were like unskilled players who try all\\r\\nthe stops and scales of an organ, and know that somehow they can make a\\r\\nmusic that exceeds the noises, monotones or simple melodies of those who\\r\\nplay upon lesser instruments. They knew their power rather than their\\r\\ninstrument or their art. The first philosophers, in short, were\\r\\nself-conscious but not self-critical.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Curtailment of Philosophy in the Age of the Sophists.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 156. The immediately succeeding phase in the history of Greek\\r\\nphilosophy was a curtailment, but only in the most superficial sense a\\r\\ncriticism, of the activity of the philosopher. In the Periclean Age\\r\\nphilosophy suffered more from inattention than from refutation. The\\r\\nscepticism of the sophists, who were the knowing men of this age, was\\r\\nnot so much conviction as indisposition. They failed to recognize the\\r\\nold philosophical problem; it did not _appeal_ to them as a genuine\\r\\nproblem. The sophists were the intellectual men of an age of _humanism_,\\r\\n_individualism_, and _secularism_. These were years in which the circle\\r\\nof human society, the state with its institutions, citizenship with its\\r\\nmanifold activities and interests, bounded the horizon of thought. What\\r\\nneed to look beyond? Life was not a problem, but an abundant opportunity\\r\\nand a sense of capacity. The world was not a mystery, but a place of\\r\\nentertainment and a sphere of action. Of this the sophists were faithful\\r\\nwitnesses. In their love of novelty, irreverence, impressionism,\\r\\nelegance of speech, and above all in their praise of individual\\r\\nefficiency, they preached and pandered to their age. Their public,\\r\\nthough it loved to abuse them, was the greatest sophist of them\\r\\nall--brilliant and capricious, incomparably rich in all but wisdom. The\\r\\nmajority belonged to what Plato called \"the sight-loving, art-loving,\\r\\nbusy class.\" This is an age, then, when the man of practical\\r\\ncommon-sense is pre\\xc3\\xabminent, and the philosopher with his dark sayings\\r\\nhas passed away. The pride of wisdom has given way to the pride of power\\r\\nand the pride of cleverness. The many men pursue the many goods of life,\\r\\nand there is no spirit among them all who, sitting apart in\\r\\ncontemplation, wonders at the meaning of the whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Socrates and the Self-criticism of the Philosopher.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 157. But in their midst there moved a strange prophet, whom they\\r\\nmistook for one of themselves. Socrates was not one who prayed in the\\r\\nwilderness, but a man of the streets and the market-place, who talked\\r\\nrather more incessantly than the rest, and apparently with less right.\\r\\nHe did not testify to the truth, but pleaded ignorance in extenuation of\\r\\nan exasperating habit of asking questions. There was, however, a humor\\r\\nand a method in his innocence that arrested attention. He was a\\r\\nformidable adversary in discussion from his very irresponsibility; and\\r\\nhe was especially successful with the more rhetorical sophists because\\r\\nhe chose his own weapons, and substituted critical analysis, question\\r\\nand answer, for the long speeches to which these teachers were\\r\\nhabituated by their profession. He appeared to be governed by an\\r\\ninsatiable inquisitiveness, and a somewhat malicious desire to discredit\\r\\nthose who spoke with authority.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to those who knew him better, and especially to Plato, who knew him\\r\\nbest, Socrates was at once the sweetest and most compelling spirit of\\r\\nhis age. There was a kind of truth in the quality of his character. He\\r\\nwas perhaps _the first of all reverent men_. In the presence of conceit\\r\\nhis self-depreciation was ironical, but in another presence it was most\\r\\ngenuine, and his deepest spring of thought and action. This other\\r\\npresence was his own ideal. Socrates was sincerely humble because,\\r\\nexpecting so much of philosophy, he saw his own deficiency. Unlike the\\r\\nunskilled player, he did not seek to _make_ music; but he loved music,\\r\\nand knew that such music as is indeed music was beyond his power. On the\\r\\nother hand he was well aware of his superiority to those in whom\\r\\nself-satisfaction was possible because they had no conception of the\\r\\nideal. Of such he could say in truth that they did not know enough even\\r\\nto realize the extent of their ignorance. The world has long been\\r\\nfamiliar with the vivid portrayal of the Socratic consciousness which is\\r\\ncontained in Plato\\'s \"Apology.\" Socrates had set out in life with the\\r\\nopinion that his was an age of exceptional enlightenment. But as he\\r\\ncame to know men he found that after all no one of them really knew what\\r\\nhe was about. Each \"sight-loving, art-loving, busy\" man was quite blind\\r\\nto the meaning of life. While he was capable of practical achievement,\\r\\nhis judgments concerning the real virtue of his achievements were\\r\\nconventional and ungrounded, a mere reflection of tradition and opinion.\\r\\nWhen asked concerning the meaning of life, or the ground of his\\r\\nopinions, he was thrown into confusion or aggravated to meaningless\\r\\nreiteration. Such men, Socrates reflected, were both unwise and\\r\\nconfirmed in their folly through being unconscious of it. Because he\\r\\nknew that vanity is vanity, that opinion is indeed mere opinion,\\r\\nSocrates felt himself to be the wisest man in a generation of dogged\\r\\nunwisdom.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Socrates\\'s Self-criticism a Prophecy of Truth.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 158. It is scarcely necessary to point out that this insight, however\\r\\nnegatively it be used, is a revelation of positive knowledge. Heraclitus\\r\\nand Parmenides claimed to know; Socrates disclaimed knowledge _for\\r\\nreasons_. Like all real criticism this is at once a confounding of error\\r\\nand a prophecy of truth. The truth so discovered is indeed not ordinary\\r\\ntruth concerning historical or physical things, but not on that account\\r\\nless significant and necessary. This truth, it will also be admitted, is\\r\\nvirtually rather than actually set forth by Socrates himself. He knew\\r\\nthat life has some meaning which those who live with conviction desire\\r\\nat heart to realize, and that knowledge has principles with which those\\r\\nwho speak with conviction intend to be consistent. There is, in short, a\\r\\nrational life and a rational discourse. Furthermore, a rational life\\r\\nwill be a life wisely directed to the end of the good; and a rational\\r\\ndiscourse one constructed with reference to the real natures of things,\\r\\nand the necessities which flow from these natures. But Socrates did not\\r\\nconclusively define either the meaning of life or the form of perfect\\r\\nknowledge. He testified to the necessity of some such truths, and his\\r\\ntestimony demonstrated both the blindness of his contemporaries and also\\r\\nhis own deficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Historical Preparation for Plato.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 159. The character and method of Socrates have their best foil in the\\r\\nsophists, but their bearing on the earlier philosophers is for our\\r\\npurposes even more instructive. Unlike Socrates these philosophers had\\r\\nnot made a study of the task of the philosopher. They _were_\\r\\nphilosophers--\"spectators of all time and all existence\"; but they were\\r\\nprecritical or dogmatic philosophers, to whom it had not occurred to\\r\\ndefine the requirements of philosophy. They knew no perfect knowledge\\r\\nother than their own actual knowledge. They defined being and\\r\\ninterpreted life without reflecting upon the quality of the knowledge\\r\\nwhose object is being, or the quality of insight that would indeed be\\r\\npractical wisdom. But when through Socrates the whole philosophical\\r\\nprospect is again revealed after the period of humanistic concentration,\\r\\nit is as an ideal whose possibilities, whose necessities, are conceived\\r\\nbefore they are realized. Socrates celebrates the r\\xc3\\xb4le of the\\r\\nphilosopher without assigning it to himself. The new philosophical\\r\\nobject is the philosopher himself; and the new insight a knowledge of\\r\\nknowledge itself. These three types of intellectual procedure, dogmatic\\r\\nspeculation concerning being, humanistic interest in life, and the\\r\\nself-criticism of thought, form the historical preparation for Plato,\\r\\nthe philosopher who defined being as the ideal of thought, and upon this\\r\\nground interpreted life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no more striking case in history of the subtle continuity of\\r\\nthought than the relation between Plato and his master Socrates. The\\r\\nwonder of it is due to the absence of any formulation of doctrine on\\r\\nthe part of Socrates himself. He only lived and talked; and yet Plato\\r\\ncreated a system of philosophy in which he is faithfully embodied. The\\r\\nform of embodiment is the dialogue, in which the talking of Socrates is\\r\\nperpetuated and conducted to profounder issues, and in which his life is\\r\\nboth rendered and interpreted. But as the vehicle of Plato\\'s thought\\r\\npreserves and makes perfect the Socratic method, so the thought itself\\r\\nbegins with the Socratic motive and remains to the end an expression of\\r\\nit. The presentiment of perfect knowledge which distinguished Socrates\\r\\nfrom his contemporaries becomes in Plato the clear vision of a realm of\\r\\nideal truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Platonism: Reality as the Absolute Ideal or Good.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 160. Plato begins his philosophy with the philosopher and the\\r\\nphilosopher\\'s interest. The philosopher is a lover, who like all lovers\\r\\nlongs for the beautiful. But he is the supreme lover, for he loves not\\r\\nthe individual beautiful object but the Absolute Beauty itself. He is a\\r\\nlover too in that he does not possess, but somehow apprehends his object\\r\\nfrom afar. Though imperfect, he seeks perfection; though standing like\\r\\nall his fellows in the twilight of half-reality, he faces toward the\\r\\nsun. Now it is the fundamental proposition of the Platonic philosophy\\r\\nthat reality is the sun itself, or the perfection whose possession every\\r\\nwise thinker covets, whose presence would satisfy every longing of\\r\\nexperience. The real is that beloved object which is \"truly beautiful,\\r\\ndelicate, perfect, and blessed.\" There is both a serious ground for such\\r\\nan affirmation and an important truth in its meaning. The ground is the\\r\\nevident incompleteness of every special judgment concerning experience.\\r\\nWe understand only in part, and we know that we understand only in part.\\r\\nWhat we discover is real enough for practical purposes, but even\\r\\ncommon-sense questions the true reality of its objects. Special\\r\\njudgments seem to terminate our thought abruptly and arbitrarily. We\\r\\ngive \"the best answer we can,\" but such answers do not come as the\\r\\ncompletion of our thinking. Our thought is in some sense surely a\\r\\nseeking, and it would appear that we are not permitted to rest and be\\r\\nsatisfied at any stage of it. If we do so we are like the\\r\\nsophists--blind to our own ignorance. But it is equally true that our\\r\\nthought is straightforward and progressive. We are not permitted to\\r\\nreturn to earlier stages, but must push on to that which is not less,\\r\\nbut more, than what we have as yet found. There is good hope, then, of\\r\\nunderstanding what the ideal may be from our knowledge of the direction\\r\\nwhich it impels us to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to understand Plato\\'s conception of the progression of experience we\\r\\nmust again catch up the Socratic strain which he weaves into every\\r\\ntheme. For Socrates, student of life and mankind, all objects were\\r\\nobjects of interest, and all interests practical interests. One is\\r\\nignorant when one does not know the good of things; opinionative when\\r\\none rates things by conventional standards; wise when one knows their\\r\\nreal good. In Platonism this practical interpretation of experience\\r\\nappears in the principle that the object of perfect knowledge is _the\\r\\ngood_. The nature of things which one seeks to know better is the good\\r\\nof things, the absolute being which is the goal of all thinking is the\\r\\nvery good itself. Plato does not use the term good in any merely\\r\\nutilitarian sense. Indeed it is very significant that for Plato there is\\r\\nno cleavage between theoretical and practical interests. To be morally\\r\\ngood is to know the good, to set one\\'s heart on the true object of\\r\\naffection; and to be theoretically sound is to understand perfection.\\r\\nThe good itself is the end of every aim, that in which all interests\\r\\nconverge. Hence it cannot be defined, as might a special good, in terms\\r\\nof the fulfilment of a set of concrete conditions, but only in terms of\\r\\nthe sense or direction of all purposes. The following passage occurs in\\r\\nthe \"Symposium\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The true order of going or being led by others to the things\\r\\n     of love, is to use the beauties of earth as steps along which\\r\\n     he mounts upward for the sake of that other beauty, going from\\r\\n     one to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair\\r\\n     forms to fair actions, and from fair actions to fair notions,\\r\\n     until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute\\r\\n     beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty\\r\\n     is.\"[329:8]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Progression of Experience toward God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 161. There is, then, a \"true order of going,\" and an order that leads\\r\\nfrom one to many, from thence to forms, from thence to morality, and\\r\\nfrom thence to the general objects of thought or _the ideas_. In the\\r\\n\"Republic,\" where the proper education of the philosopher is in\\r\\nquestion, it is proposed that he shall study arithmetic, geometry,\\r\\nastronomy, and dialectic. Thus in each case mathematics is the first\\r\\nadvance in knowledge, and dialectic the nearest to perfection. Most of\\r\\nPlato\\'s examples are drawn from mathematics. This science replaces the\\r\\nvariety and vagueness of the forms of experience with _clear_,\\r\\n_unitary_, _definite_, and _eternal_ natures, such as the number and\\r\\nthe geometrical figure. Thus certain individual things are approximately\\r\\ntriangular, but subject to alteration, and indefinitely many. On the\\r\\nother hand the triangle as defined by geometry is the fixed and\\r\\nunequivocal nature or idea which such experiences suggest; and the\\r\\nphilosophical mind will at once pass to it from these. But the\\r\\nmathematical objects are themselves not thoroughly understood when\\r\\nunderstood only in mathematical terms, for the foundations of\\r\\nmathematics are arbitrary. And the same is true of all the so-called\\r\\nspecial sciences. Even the scientists themselves, says Plato,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"only dream about being, but never can behold the waking\\r\\n     reality so long as they leave the hypotheses they use\\r\\n     unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For\\r\\n     when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the\\r\\n     conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of\\r\\n     he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a conventional\\r\\n     statement will ever become science?\"[330:9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the science of dialectics we are to understand the connections\\r\\nand sequences of ideas themselves, in the hope of eliminating every\\r\\narbitrariness and conventionality within a system of truth that is pure\\r\\nand self-luminous rationality. To this science, which is the great\\r\\ninterest of his later years, Plato contributes only incomplete studies\\r\\nand experiments. We must be satisfied with the playful answer with\\r\\nwhich, in the \"Republic,\" he replies to Glaucon\\'s entreaty that \"he\\r\\nproceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain, and\\r\\ndescribe that in like manner\": \"Dear Glaucon, you will not be able to\\r\\nfollow me here, though I would do my best.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a philosophical system has been projected. The real is that perfect\\r\\nsignificance or meaning which thought and every interest suggests, and\\r\\ntoward which there is in experience an appreciable movement. It is this\\r\\nsignificance which makes things what they really are, and which\\r\\nconstitutes our understanding of them. In itself it transcends the steps\\r\\nwhich lead to it; \"for God,\" says Plato, \"mingles not with men.\" But it\\r\\nis nevertheless the meaning of human life. And this we can readily\\r\\nconceive. The last word may transform the sentence from nonsense into\\r\\nsense, and it would be true to say that its sense mingles not with\\r\\nnonsense. Similarly the last touch of the brush may transform an\\r\\ninchoate mass of color into a picture, disarray into an object of\\r\\nbeauty; and its beauty mingles not with ugliness. So life, when it\\r\\nfinally realizes itself, obtains a new and incommensurable quality of\\r\\nperfection in which humanity is transformed into deity. There is frankly\\r\\nno provision for imperfection in such a world. In his later writings\\r\\nPlato sounds his characteristic note less frequently, and permits the\\r\\nideal to create a cosmos through the admixture of matter. But in his\\r\\nmoment of inspiration, the Platonist will have no sense for the\\r\\nimperfect. It is the darkness behind his back, or the twilight through\\r\\nwhich he passes on his way to the light. He will use even the beauties\\r\\nof earth only \"as steps along which he mounts upward for the sake of\\r\\nthat other beauty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Aristotle\\'s Hierarchy of Substances in Relation to\\r\\nPlatonism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 162. We have met, then, with two distinct philosophical doctrines\\r\\nwhich arise from the conception of the _absolute_, or the philosopher\\'s\\r\\npeculiar object: the doctrine of the _absolute being_ or _substance_,\\r\\nand that of the _absolute ideal_ or _good_. Both doctrines are realistic\\r\\nin that they assume reality to be demonstrated or revealed, rather than\\r\\ncreated, by knowledge. Both are rationalistic in that they develop a\\r\\nsystem of philosophy from the problem of philosophy, or deduce a\\r\\ndefinition of reality from the conception, of reality. There remains a\\r\\nthird doctrine of the same type--the philosophy of Aristotle, the most\\r\\nelaborately constructed system of Greek antiquity, and the most potent\\r\\ninfluence exerted upon the Scholastic Philosophy of the long medi\\xc3\\xa6val\\r\\nperiod. This philosophy was rehabilitated in the eighteenth century by\\r\\nLeibniz, the brilliant librarian of the court of Hanover. The\\r\\nextraordinary comprehensiveness of Aristotle\\'s philosophy makes it quite\\r\\nimpossible to render here even a general account of it. There is\\r\\nscarcely any human discipline that does not to some extent draw upon it.\\r\\nWe are concerned only with the central principles of the metaphysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the common ground of rationalism and realism, Plato and Aristotle\\r\\nare complementary in temper, method, and principle. Plato\\'s is the\\r\\ngenius of inspiration and fertility, Aristotle\\'s the genius of\\r\\nerudition, mastery, and synthesis. In form, Plato\\'s is the gift of\\r\\nexpression, Aristotle\\'s the gift of arrangement. Plato was born and bred\\r\\nan aristocrat, and became the lover of the best--the uncompromising\\r\\npurist; Aristotle is middle-class, and limitlessly wide, hospitable, and\\r\\npatient in his interests. Thus while both are speculative and acute,\\r\\nPlato\\'s mind is intensive and profound, Aristotle\\'s extensive and\\r\\norderly. It was inevitable, then, that Aristotle should find Plato\\r\\none-sided. The philosophy of the ideal is not worldly enough to be true.\\r\\nIt is a religion rather than a theory of reality. Aristotle, however,\\r\\nwould not renounce it, but construe it that it may better provide for\\r\\nnature and history. This is the significance of his new terminology.\\r\\nMatter, to which Plato reluctantly concedes some room as a principle of\\r\\ndegradation in the universe, is now admitted to good standing. _Matter_\\r\\nor material is indispensable to being as its potentiality or that out of\\r\\nwhich it is constituted. The ideal, on the other hand, loses its\\r\\nexclusive title to the predicate of reality, and becomes the _form_, or\\r\\nthe determinate nature which exists only in its particular embodiments.\\r\\nThe being or _substance_ is the concrete individual, of which these are\\r\\nthe abstracted aspects. Aristotle\\'s \"form,\" like Plato\\'s \"idea,\" is a\\r\\nteleological principle. The essential nature of the object is its\\r\\nperfection. It is furthermore essential to the object that it should\\r\\nstrive after a higher perfection. With Aristotle, however, the reality\\r\\nis not the consummation of the process, the highest perfection in and\\r\\nfor itself, but the very hierarchy of objects that ascends toward it.\\r\\nThe highest perfection, or God, is not itself coextensive with being,\\r\\nbut the final cause of being--that on account of which the whole\\r\\nprogression of events takes place. Reality is the development with all\\r\\nof its ascending stages from the maximum of potentiality, or matter, to\\r\\nthe maximum of actuality, or God the pure form.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Aristotelian Philosophy as a Reconciliation of Platonism\\r\\nand Spinozism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 163. To understand the virtue of this philosophy as a basis for the\\r\\nreconciliation of different interests, we must recall the relation\\r\\nbetween Plato and Spinoza. Their characteristic difference appears to\\r\\nthe best advantage in connection with mathematical truth. Both regarded\\r\\ngeometry as the best model for philosophical thinking, but for different\\r\\nreasons. Spinoza prized geometry for its necessity, and proposed to\\r\\nextend it. His philosophy is the attempt to formulate a geometry of\\r\\nbeing, which shall set forth the inevitable certainties of the universe.\\r\\nPlato, on the other hand, prized geometry rather for its definition of\\r\\ntypes, for its knowledge of pure or perfect natures such as the circle\\r\\nand triangle, which in immediate experience are only approximated. His\\r\\nphilosophy defines reality similarly as the absolute perfection.\\r\\nApplied to nature Spinozism is mechanical, and looks for necessary laws,\\r\\nwhile Platonism is teleological, and looks for adaptation and\\r\\nsignificance. Aristotle\\'s position is intermediate. With Plato he\\r\\naffirms that the good is the ultimate principle. But this very principle\\r\\nis conceived to govern a universe of substances, each of which maintains\\r\\nits own proper being, and all of which are reciprocally determined in\\r\\ntheir changes. Final causes dominate nature, but work through efficient\\r\\ncauses. Reality is not pure perfection, as in Platonism, nor the\\r\\nindifferent necessity, as in Spinozism, but the system of beings\\r\\nnecessary to the complete progression toward the highest perfection. The\\r\\nAristotelian philosophy promises, then, to overcome both the hard\\r\\nrealism of Parmenides and Spinoza, and also the supernaturalism of\\r\\nPlato.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Leibniz\\'s Application of the Conception of Development to the\\r\\nProblem of Imperfection.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 164. But it promises, furthermore, to remedy the defect common to\\r\\nthese two doctrines, the very besetting problem of this whole type of\\r\\nphilosophy. That problem, as has been seen, is to provide for the\\r\\nimperfect within the perfect, for the temporal incidents of nature and\\r\\nhistory within the eternal being. Many absolutist philosophers have\\r\\ndeclared the explanation of this realm to be impossible, and have\\r\\ncontented themselves with calling it the realm of opinion or appearance.\\r\\nAnd this realm of opinion or appearance has been used as a proof of the\\r\\nabsolute. Zeno, the pupil of Parmenides, was the first to elaborate what\\r\\nhave since come to be known as the paradoxes of the empirical world.\\r\\nMost of these paradoxes turn upon the infinite extension and\\r\\ndivisibility of space and time. Zeno was especially interested in the\\r\\ndifficulty of conceiving motion, which involves both space and time,\\r\\nand thought himself to have demonstrated its absurdity and\\r\\nimpossibility.[337:10] His argument is thus the complement of\\r\\nParmenides\\'s argument for the indivisible and unchanging substance. Now\\r\\nthe method which Zeno here adopts may be extended to cover the whole\\r\\nrealm of nature and history. We should then be dialectically driven from\\r\\nthis realm to take refuge in absolute being. But the empirical world is\\r\\nnot destroyed by disparagement, and cannot long lack champions even\\r\\namong the absolutists themselves. The reconciliation of nature and\\r\\nhistory with the absolute being became the special interest of Leibniz,\\r\\nthe great modern Aristotelian. As a scientist and man of affairs, he\\r\\nwas profoundly dissatisfied with Spinoza\\'s resolution of nature, the\\r\\nhuman individual, and the human society into the universal being. He\\r\\nbecame an advocate of individualism while retaining the general aim and\\r\\nmethod of rationalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Aristotle, Leibniz attributes reality to individual substances,\\r\\nwhich he calls \"monads\"; and like Aristotle he conceives these monads to\\r\\ncompose an ascending order, with God, the monad of monads, as its\\r\\ndominating goal.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Furthermore, every substance is like an entire world and like\\r\\n     a mirror of God, or indeed of the whole world which it\\r\\n     portrays, each one in its own fashion; almost as the same city\\r\\n     is variously represented according to the various situations\\r\\n     of him who is regarding it. Thus the universe is multiplied in\\r\\n     some sort as many times as there are substances, and the glory\\r\\n     of God is multiplied in the same way by as many wholly\\r\\n     different representations of his works.\"[338:11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very \"glory of God,\" then, requires the innumerable finite\\r\\nindividuals with all their characteristic imperfections, that the\\r\\nuniverse may lack no possible shade or quality of perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Problem of Imperfection Remains Unsolved.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 165. But the besetting problem is in fact not solved, and is one of\\r\\nthe chief incentives to that other philosophy of absolutism which\\r\\ndefines an absolute spirit or mind. Both Aristotle and Leibniz undertake\\r\\nto make the perfection which determines the order of the hierarchy of\\r\\nsubstances, at the same time the responsible author of the whole\\r\\nhierarchy. In this case the dilemma is plain. If the divine form or the\\r\\ndivine monad be other than the stages that lead up to it, these latter\\r\\ncannot be essential to it, for God is by definition absolutely\\r\\nself-sufficient. If, on the other hand, God is identical with the\\r\\ndevelopment in its entirety, then two quite incommensurable standards of\\r\\nperfection determine the supremacy of the divine nature, that of the\\r\\nwhole and that of the highest parts of the whole. The union of these two\\r\\nand the definition of a perfection which may be at once the development\\r\\nand its goal, is the task of absolute idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Absolute Realism in Epistemology. Rationalism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 166. Of the two fundamental questions of epistemology, absolute\\r\\nrealism answers the one explicitly, the other implicitly. As respects\\r\\n_the source of the most valid knowledge_, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle,\\r\\nSpinoza are all agreed: true knowledge is the work of reason, of pure\\r\\nintellection. Plato is the great exponent of dialectic, or the\\r\\nreciprocal affinities and necessities of ideas. Aristotle is the founder\\r\\nof deductive logic. Spinoza proposes to consider even \"human actions and\\r\\ndesires\" as though he were \"concerned with lines, planes, and solids.\"\\r\\nEmpirical data may be the occasion, but cannot be the ground of the\\r\\nhighest knowledge. According to Leibniz,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"it seems that necessary truths, such as we find in pure\\r\\n     mathematics, and especially in arithmetic and geometry, must\\r\\n     have principles whose proof does not depend upon instances,\\r\\n     nor, consequently, upon the witness of the senses, although\\r\\n     without the senses it would never have come into our heads to\\r\\n     think of them.\"[340:12]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Relation of Thought and its Object in Absolute Realism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 167. The answers which these philosophies give to the question of _the\\r\\nrelation between the state of knowledge and its object_, divide them\\r\\ninto two groups. Among the ancients reason is regarded as the means of\\r\\nemancipation from the limitations of the private mind. \"The sleeping\\r\\nturn aside each into a world of his own,\" but \"the waking\"--the wise\\r\\nmen--\"have one and the same world.\" What the individual knows belongs to\\r\\nhimself only in so far as it is inadequate. Hence for Plato the ideas\\r\\nare not the attributes of a mind, but that self-subsistent truth to\\r\\nwhich, in its moments of insight, a mind may have access. Opinion is \"my\\r\\nown,\" the truth is being. The position of Aristotle is equally clear.\\r\\n\"Actual knowledge,\" he maintains, \"is identical with its object.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpinoza and Leibniz belong to another age. Modern philosophy began with\\r\\na new emphasis upon self-consciousness. In his celebrated argument--\"I\\r\\nthink, hence I am\" (_cogito ergo sum_)--Descartes established the\\r\\nindependent and substantial reality of the thinking activity. The \"I\\r\\nthink\" is recognized as in itself a fundamental being, known intuitively\\r\\nto the thinker himself. Now although Spinoza and Leibniz are finally\\r\\ndetermined by the same motives that obtain in the cases of Plato and\\r\\nAristotle, they must reckon with this new distinction between the\\r\\nthinker and his object. The result in the case of Spinoza is the\\r\\ndoctrine of \"parallelism,\" in which mind is defined as an \"infinite\\r\\nattribute\" of substance, an aspect or phase coextensive with the whole\\r\\nof being. The result in the case of Leibniz is his doctrine of\\r\\n\"representation\" and \"pre\\xc3\\xabstablished harmony,\" whereby each monadic\\r\\nsubstance is in itself an active spiritual entity, and belongs to the\\r\\nuniverse through its knowledge of a specific stage of the development of\\r\\nthe universe. But both Spinoza and Leibniz subordinate such conceptions\\r\\nas these to the fundamental identity that pervades the whole. With\\r\\nSpinoza the attributes belong to the same absolute substance, and with\\r\\nLeibniz the monads represent the one universe. And with both, finally,\\r\\nthe perfection of knowledge, or the knowledge of God, is\\r\\nindistinguishable from its object, God himself. The epistemological\\r\\nsubtleties peculiar to these philosophers are not stable doctrines, but\\r\\nrender inevitable either a return to the simpler and bolder realism of\\r\\nthe Greeks, or a passing over into the more radical and systematic\\r\\ndoctrine of absolute idealism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Stoic and Spinozistic Ethics of Necessity.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 168. We have met with two general motives, both of which are\\r\\nsubordinated to the doctrine of an absolute being postulated and sought\\r\\nby philosophy. The one of these motives leads to the conception of the\\r\\nabsolutely necessary and immutable substance, the other to the\\r\\nconception of a consummate perfection. There is an _interpretation of\\r\\nlife_ appropriate to each of these conceptions. Both agree in regarding\\r\\nlife seriously, in defining reason or philosophy as the highest human\\r\\nactivity, and in emphasizing the identity of the individual\\'s good with\\r\\nthe good of the universe. But there are striking differences of tone and\\r\\nspirit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the metaphysics of the Stoics have various affiliations, the\\r\\nStoic code of morality is the true practical sequel to the\\r\\nEleatic-Spinozistic view of the world. The Stoic is one who has set his\\r\\naffections on the eternal being. He asks nothing of it for himself, but\\r\\nidentifies himself with it. The saving grace is a sense of reality. The\\r\\nvirtuous man is not one who remakes the world, or draws upon it for his\\r\\nprivate uses; even less one who rails against it, or complains that it\\r\\nhas used him ill. He is rather one who recognizes that there is but one\\r\\nreally valid claim, that of the universe itself. But he not only submits\\r\\nto this claim on account of its superiority; he makes it his own. The\\r\\ndiscipline of Stoicism is the regulation of the individual will to the\\r\\nend that it may coincide with the universal will. There is a part of man\\r\\nby virtue of which he is satisfied with what things are, whatever they\\r\\nbe. That part, designated by the Stoics as \"the ruling part,\" is the\\r\\nreason. In so far as man seeks to understand the laws and natures which\\r\\nactually prevail, he cannot be discontented with anything whatsoever\\r\\nthat may be known to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For, in so far as we are intelligent beings, we cannot desire\\r\\n     anything save that which is necessary, nor yield absolute\\r\\n     acquiescence to anything, save to that which is true:\\r\\n     wherefore, in so far as we have a right understanding of these\\r\\n     things, the endeavor of the better part of ourselves is in\\r\\n     harmony with the order of nature as a whole.\"[344:13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn agreement with this teaching of Spinoza\\'s is the famous Stoic formula\\r\\nto the effect that \"nothing can happen contrary to the will of the wise\\r\\nman,\" who is free through his very acquiescence. If reason be the proper\\r\\n\"ruling part,\" the first step in the moral life is the subordination of\\r\\nthe appetitive nature and the enthronement of reason. One who is himself\\r\\nrational will then recognize the fellowship of all rational beings, and\\r\\nthe unitary and beneficent rationality of the entire universe. The\\r\\nhighest morality is thus already upon the plane of religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Platonic Ethics of Perfection.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 169. With Spinoza and the Stoics, the perfection of the individual is\\r\\nreduced to what the universe requires of him. The good man is willing to\\r\\nbe whatever he must be, for the sake of the whole with which through\\r\\nreason he is enabled to identify himself. With Plato and Aristotle the\\r\\nperfection of the individual himself is commended, that the universe may\\r\\nabound in perfection. The good man is the ideal man--the expression of\\r\\nthe type. And how different the quality of a morality in keeping with\\r\\nthis principle! The virtues which Plato enumerates--temperance, courage,\\r\\nwisdom, and justice--compose a consummate human nature. He is thinking\\r\\nnot of the necessities but of the possibilities of life. Knowledge of\\r\\nthe truth will indeed be the best of human living, but knowledge is not\\r\\nprized because it can reconcile man to his limitations; it is the very\\r\\noverflowing of his cup of life. The youth are to\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"dwell in the land of health, amid fair sights and sounds; and\\r\\n     beauty, the effluence of fair works, will visit the eye and\\r\\n     ear, like a healthful breeze from a purer region, and\\r\\n     insensibly draw the soul even in childhood into harmony with\\r\\n     the beauty of reason.\"[345:14]\\r\\n\\r\\nAristotle\\'s account of human perfection is more circumstantial and more\\r\\nprosaic. \"The function of man is an activity of soul in accordance with\\r\\nreason,\" and his happiness or well-being will consist in the fulness of\\r\\nrational living. But such fulness requires a sphere of life that will\\r\\ncall forth and exercise the highest human capacities. Aristotle frankly\\r\\npronounces \"external goods\" to be indispensable, and happiness to be\\r\\ntherefore \"a gift of the gods.\" The rational man will acquire a certain\\r\\nexquisiteness or finesse of action, a \"mean\" of conduct; and this virtue\\r\\nwill be diversified through the various relations into which he must\\r\\nenter, and the different situations which he must meet. He will be not\\r\\nmerely brave, temperate, and just, as Plato would have him, but liberal,\\r\\nmagnificent, gentle, truthful, witty, friendly, and in all\\r\\nself-respecting or high-minded. In addition to these strictly moral\\r\\nvirtues, he will possess the intellectual virtues of prudence and\\r\\nwisdom, the resources of art and science; and will finally possess the\\r\\ngift of insight, or intuitive reason. Speculation will be his highest\\r\\nactivity, and the mark of his kinship with the gods who dwell in the\\r\\nperpetual contemplation of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Religion of Fulfilment, and the Religion of\\r\\nRenunciation.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 170. Aristotle\\'s ethics expresses the buoyancy of the ancient world,\\r\\nwhen the individual does not feel himself oppressed by the eternal\\r\\nreality, but rejoices in it. He is not too conscious of his sufferings\\r\\nto be disinterested in his admiration and wonder. It is this which\\r\\ndistinguishes the religion of Plato and Aristotle from that of the\\r\\nStoics and Spinoza. With both alike, religion consists not in making the\\r\\nworld, but in contemplating it; not in co\\xc3\\xb6perating with God, but in\\r\\nworshipping him. Plato and Aristotle, however, do not find any\\r\\nantagonism between the ways of God and the natural interests of men. God\\r\\ndoes not differ from men save in his exalted perfection. The\\r\\ncontemplation and worship of him comes as the final and highest stage of\\r\\na life which is organic and continuous throughout. The love of God is\\r\\nthe natural love when it has found its true object.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For he who has been instructed thus far in the things of\\r\\n     love, and who has learned to see the beautiful in due order\\r\\n     and succession, when he comes toward the end will suddenly\\r\\n     perceive a nature of wondrous beauty--and this, Socrates, is\\r\\n     that final cause of all our former toils, which in the first\\r\\n     place is everlasting--not growing and decaying, or waxing and\\r\\n     waning; in the next place not fair in one point of view and\\r\\n     foul in another, . . . or in the likeness of a face or hands\\r\\n     or any other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of\\r\\n     speech or knowledge, nor existing in any other being; . . .\\r\\n     but beauty only, absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting,\\r\\n     which without diminution and without increase, or any change,\\r\\n     is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing beauties of all\\r\\n     other things.\"[347:15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe religion of Spinoza is the religion of one who has renounced the\\r\\nfavor of the universe. He was deprived early in life of every benefit of\\r\\nfortune, and set out to find the good which required no special\\r\\ndispensation but only the common lot and the common human endowment. He\\r\\nfound that good to consist in the conviction of the necessity, made\\r\\nacceptable through the supremacy of the understanding. The like faith of\\r\\nthe Stoics makes of no account the difference of fortune between Marcus\\r\\nthe emperor and Epictetus the slave.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"For two reasons, then, it is right to be content with that\\r\\n     which happens to thee; the one because it was done for thee\\r\\n     and prescribed for thee, and in a manner had reference to\\r\\n     thee, originally from the most ancient causes spun with thy\\r\\n     destiny; and the other because even that which comes severally\\r\\n     to every man is to the power which administers the universe a\\r\\n     cause of felicity and perfection, nay even of its very\\r\\n     continuance. For the integrity of the whole is mutilated, if\\r\\n     thou cuttest off anything whatever from the conjunction and\\r\\n     the continuity either of the parts or of the causes. And thou\\r\\n     dost cut off, as far as it is in thy power, when thou art\\r\\n     dissatisfied, and in a manner triest to put anything out of\\r\\n     the way.\"[348:16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[306:1] By _Absolute Realism_ is meant that system of philosophy which\\r\\ndefines the universe as the _absolute being_, implied in knowledge as\\r\\nits final object, but assumed to be independent of knowledge.

Absolute idealism is the most elaborately constructive of all the\\r\\nhistorical types of philosophy. Though it may have overlooked elementary\\r\\ntruths, and have sought to combine irreconcilable principles, it cannot\\r\\nbe charged with lack of sophistication or subtlety. Its great virtue is\\r\\nits recognition of problems--its exceeding circumspection; while its\\r\\ngreat promise is due to its comprehensiveness--its generous provision\\r\\nfor all interests and points of view. But its very breadth and\\r\\ncomplexity render this philosophy peculiarly liable to the equivocal use\\r\\nof conceptions. This may be readily understood from the nature of the\\r\\ncentral doctrine of absolute idealism. According to this doctrine it is\\r\\nproposed to define the universe as an _absolute spirit_; or a being\\r\\ninfinite, ultimate, eternal, and self-sufficient, like the being of\\r\\nPlato and Spinoza, but possessing at the same time the distinguishing\\r\\nproperties of spirit. Such conceptions as self-consciousness, will,\\r\\nknowledge, and moral goodness are carried over from the realm of human\\r\\nendeavor and social relations to the unitary and all-inclusive reality.\\r\\nNow it has been objected that this procedure is either meaningless, in\\r\\nthat it so applies the term spirit as to contradict its meaning; or\\r\\nprejudicial to spiritual interests, in that it neutralizes the\\r\\nproperties of spirit through so extending their use. Thus one may\\r\\ncontend that to affirm that the universe as a whole is spirit is\\r\\nmeaningless, since moral goodness requires special conditions and\\r\\nrelations that cannot be attributed to the universe as a whole; or one\\r\\nmay contend that such doctrine is prejudicial to moral interests because\\r\\nby attributing spiritual perfection to the totality of being it\\r\\ndiscredits all moral loyalties and antagonisms. The difficulties that\\r\\nlie in the way of absolute idealism are due, then, to the complexity of\\r\\nits synthesis, to its complementary recognition of differences and\\r\\nresolution of them into unity. But this synthesis is due to the urgency\\r\\nof certain great problems which the first or realistic expression of\\r\\nthe absolutist motive left undiscovered and unsolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Great Outstanding Problems of Absolutism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 172. It is natural to approach so deliberate and calculating a\\r\\nphilosophy from the stand-point of the problems which it proposes to\\r\\nsolve. One of these is the epistemological problem of the relation\\r\\nbetween the state of knowledge and its object. Naturalism and absolute\\r\\nrealism side with common-sense in its assumption that although the real\\r\\nobject is essential to the valid state of knowledge, its being known is\\r\\nnot essential to the real object. Subjectivism, on the other hand,\\r\\nmaintains that being is essentially the content of a knowing state, or\\r\\nan activity of the knower himself. Absolute idealism proposes to accept\\r\\nthe general epistemological principle of subjectivism; but to satisfy\\r\\nthe realistic demand for a standard, compelling object, by setting up an\\r\\n_absolute knower_, with whom all valid knowledge must be in agreement.\\r\\nThis epistemological statement of absolute idealism is its most mature\\r\\nphase; and the culminating phase, in which it shows unmistakable signs\\r\\nof passing over into another doctrine. We must look for its pristine\\r\\ninspiration in its solution of another fundamental problem: that of the\\r\\nrelation between the absolute and the empirical. Like absolute realism,\\r\\nthis philosophy regards the universe as a unitary and internally\\r\\nnecessary being, and undertakes to hold that being accountable for every\\r\\nitem of experience. But we have found that absolute realism is beset\\r\\nwith the difficulty of thus accounting for the fragmentariness and\\r\\nisolation of the individual. The contention that the universe must\\r\\nreally be a rational or perfect unity is disputed by the evident\\r\\nmultiplicity, irrelevance, and imperfection in the foreground of\\r\\nexperience. The inference to perfection and the confession of\\r\\nimperfection seem equally unavoidable. Rational necessities and\\r\\nempirical facts are out of joint.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Greek Philosophers and the Problem of Evil. The Task of\\r\\nthe New Absolutism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 173. Even Plato had been conscious of a certain responsibility for\\r\\nmatters of fact. Inasmuch as he attached the predicate of reality to the\\r\\nabsolute perfection, he made that being the only source to which they\\r\\ncould be referred. Perhaps, then, he suggests, they are due to the very\\r\\nbounteousness of God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He was good, and no goodness can ever have any jealousy of\\r\\n     anything. And being free from jealousy, he desired that all\\r\\n     things should be as like himself as possible.\"[352:2]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlotinus, in whom Platonism is leavened by the spirit of an age which\\r\\nis convinced of sin, and which is therefore more keenly aware of the\\r\\npositive existence of the imperfect, follows out this suggestion.\\r\\nCreation is \"emanation\"--the overflow of God\\'s excess of goodness. But\\r\\none does not readily understand how goodness, desiring all things to be\\r\\nlike itself, should thereupon create evil--even to make it good. The\\r\\nAristotelian philosophy, with its conception of the gradation of\\r\\nsubstances, would seem to be better equipped to meet the difficulty. A\\r\\ndevelopment requires stages; and every finite thing may thus be perfect\\r\\nin its way and perfect in its place, while in the absolute truth or God\\r\\nthere is realized the meaning of the whole order. But if so, there is\\r\\nevidently something that escapes God, to wit, the meaningless and\\r\\nunfitness, the error and evil, of the stages in their successive\\r\\nisolation. Nor is it of any avail to insist (as did Plato, Aristotle,\\r\\nand Spinoza alike) that these are only privation, and therefore not to\\r\\nbe counted in the sum of reality. For privation is itself an experience,\\r\\nwith a great variety of implications, moral and psychological; and these\\r\\ncannot be attributed to God or deduced from him, in consideration of his\\r\\nabsolute perfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe task of the new absolutism is now in clear view. The perfect must\\r\\nbe amended to admit the imperfect. The absolute significance must be so\\r\\nconstrued as to provide for the evident facts; for the unmeaning things\\r\\nand changes of the natural order; for ignorance, sin, despair, and every\\r\\nhuman deficiency. The new philosophy is to solve this problem by\\r\\ndefining a _spiritual absolute_, and by so construing the life or\\r\\ndynamics of spirit, as to demonstrate the necessity of the very\\r\\nimperfection and opposition which is so baffling to the realist.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Beginning of Absolute Idealism in Kant\\'s Analysis of\\r\\nExperience.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 174. Absolute idealism, which is essentially a modern doctrine, does\\r\\nnot begin with rhapsodies, but with a very sober analysis of familiar\\r\\ntruths, conducted by the most sober of all philosophers, Immanuel Kant.\\r\\nThis philosopher lived in K\\xc3\\xb6nigsberg, Germany, at the close of the\\r\\neighteenth century. He is related to absolute idealism much as Socrates\\r\\nis related to Platonism: he was not himself speculative, but employed a\\r\\ncritical method which was transformed by his followers into a\\r\\nmetaphysical construction. It is essential to the understanding both of\\r\\nKant and of his more speculative successors, to observe that he begins\\r\\nwith the recognition of certain non-philosophical truths--those of\\r\\n_natural science_ and _the moral consciousness_. He accepts the order of\\r\\nnature formulated in the Newtonian dynamics, and the moral order\\r\\nacknowledged in the common human conviction of duty. And he is\\r\\ninterested in discovering the ground upon which these common\\r\\naffirmations rest, the structure which virtually supports them as types\\r\\nof knowledge. But a general importance attaches to the analysis because\\r\\nthese two types of knowledge (together with the \\xc3\\xa6sthetic judgment, which\\r\\nis similarly analyzed) are regarded by Kant as coextensive with\\r\\nexperience itself. The _very least experience_ that can be reported upon\\r\\nat all is an experience of nature or duty, and as such will be informed\\r\\nwith their characteristic principles. Let us consider the former type.\\r\\nThe simplest instance of nature is the experience of the single\\r\\nperceived object. In the first place, such an object will be perceived\\r\\nas in space and time. These Kant calls the _forms of intuition_. An\\r\\nobject cannot even be presented or given without them. But, furthermore,\\r\\nit will be regarded as substance, that is, as having a substratum that\\r\\npersists through changes of position or quality. It will also be\\r\\nregarded as causally dependent upon other objects like itself.\\r\\nCausality, substance, and like principles to the number of twelve, Kant\\r\\ncalls the _categories of the understanding_. Both intuition and\\r\\nunderstanding are indispensable to the experience of any object\\r\\nwhatsoever. They may be said to condition the object in general. Their\\r\\nprinciples condition the process of making something out of the manifold\\r\\nof sensation. But similarly, every moral experience recognizes what Kant\\r\\ncalls _the categorical imperative_. The categorical imperative is the\\r\\nlaw of reasonableness or impartiality in conduct, requiring the\\r\\nindividual to act on a maxim which he can \"will to be law universal.\" No\\r\\nstate of desire or situation calling for action means anything morally\\r\\nexcept in the light of this obligation. Thus certain principles of\\r\\nthought and action are said to be implicit in all experience. They are\\r\\nuniversal and necessary in the sense that they are discovered as the\\r\\nconditions not of any particular experience, but of experience in\\r\\ngeneral. This implicit or virtual presence in experience in general,\\r\\nKant calls their transcendental character, and the process of\\r\\nexplicating them is his famous _Transcendental Deduction_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Kant\\'s Principles Restricted to the Experiences which they\\r\\nSet in Order.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 175. The restriction which Kant puts upon his method is quite\\r\\nessential to its meaning. I deduce the categories, for example, just in\\r\\nso far as I find them to be necessary to perception. Without them my\\r\\nperception is blind, I make nothing of it; with them my experience\\r\\nbecomes systematic and rational. But categories which I so deduce must\\r\\nbe forever limited to the r\\xc3\\xb4le for which they are defined. Categories\\r\\nwithout perceptions are \"empty\"; they have validity solely with\\r\\nreference to the experience which they set in order. Indeed, I cannot\\r\\neven complete that order. The orderly arrangement of parts of experience\\r\\nsuggests, and suggests irresistibly, a perfect system. I can even define\\r\\nthe ideas and ideals through which such a perfect system might be\\r\\nrealized. But I cannot in the Kantian sense attach reality to it because\\r\\nit is not indispensable to experience. It must remain an ideal which\\r\\nregulates my thinking of such parts of it as fall within the range of my\\r\\nperception; or it may through my moral nature become the realm of my\\r\\nliving and an object of faith. In short, Kant\\'s is essentially a\\r\\n\"critical philosophy,\" a logical and analytical study of the special\\r\\nterms and relations of human knowledge. He denies the validity of these\\r\\nterms and relations beyond this realm. His critiques are an inventory\\r\\nof the conditions, principles, and prospects of that cognition which,\\r\\nalthough not alone ideally conceivable, is alone possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Post-Kantian Metaphysics is a Generalization of the\\r\\nCognitive and Moral Consciousness as Analyzed by Kant. The Absolute\\r\\nSpirit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 176. With the successors of Kant, as with the successors of Socrates,\\r\\na criticism becomes a system of metaphysics. This transformation is\\r\\neffected in the post-Kantians by _a generalization of the human\\r\\ncognitive consciousness_. According to Kant\\'s analysis it contains a\\r\\nmanifold of sense which must be organized by categories in obedience to\\r\\nthe ideal of a rational universe. The whole enterprise, with its\\r\\nproblems given in perception, its instruments available in the\\r\\nactivities of the understanding, and its ideals revealed in the reason,\\r\\nis an organic spiritual unity, manifesting itself in the\\r\\nself-consciousness of the thinker. Now in absolute idealism this very\\r\\nenterprise of knowledge, made universal and called the _absolute spirit_\\r\\nor _mind_, is taken to be the ultimate reality. And here at length would\\r\\nseem to be afforded the conception of a being to which the problematic\\r\\nand the rational, the data and the principles, the natural and the\\r\\nideal, are alike indispensable. We are now to seek the real not in the\\r\\nideal itself, but in that spiritual unity in which appearance is the\\r\\nincentive to truth, and natural imperfection the spring to goodness.\\r\\nThis may be translated into the language which Plato uses in the\\r\\n\"Symposium,\" when Diotima is revealing to Socrates the meaning of love.\\r\\nThe new reality will be not the loved one, but love itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What then is Love? Is he mortal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"No.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What then?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As in the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal,\\r\\n     but is a mean between them.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What is he then, Diotima?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"He is a great spirit, and like all that is spiritual he is\\r\\n     intermediate between the divine and the mortal.\"[359:3]\\r\\n\\r\\nReality is no longer the God who mingles not with men, but that power\\r\\nwhich, as Diotima further says, \"interprets and conveys to the gods the\\r\\nprayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and rewards of\\r\\nthe gods.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn speaking for such an idealism, Emerson says:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Everything good is on the highway. The middle region of our\\r\\n     being is the temperate zone. We may climb into the thin and\\r\\n     cold realm of pure geometry and lifeless science, or sink into\\r\\n     that of sensation. Between these extremes is the equator of\\r\\n     life, of thought, of spirit, of poetry. . . . The mid-world is\\r\\n     best.\"[359:4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new reality is this highway of the spirit, the very course and\\r\\nraceway of self-consciousness. It is traversed in the movement and\\r\\nself-correction of thought, in the interest in ideals, or in the\\r\\nsubmission of the will to the control of the moral law.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Fichteanism, or the Absolute Spirit as Moral Activity.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 177. It is the last of these phases of self-consciousness that Fichte,\\r\\nwho was Kant\\'s immediate successor, regards as of paramount importance.\\r\\nAs Platonism began with the ideal of the good or the object of life, so\\r\\nthe new idealism begins with the conviction of duty, or _the story of\\r\\nlife_. Being is the living moral nature compelled to build itself a\\r\\nnatural order wherein it may obey the moral law, and to divide itself\\r\\ninto a community of moral selves through which the moral virtues may be\\r\\nrealized. Nature and society flow from the conception of an absolute\\r\\nmoral activity, or ego. Such an ego could not be pure and isolated and\\r\\nyet be moral. The evidence of this is the common moral consciousness. My\\r\\nduty compels me to act upon the not-self or environment, and to respect\\r\\nand co\\xc3\\xb6perate with other selves. Fichte\\'s absolute is this moral\\r\\nconsciousness universalized and made eternal. Moral value being its\\r\\nfundamental principle the universe must on that very account embrace\\r\\nboth nature, or moral indifference, and humanity, or moral limitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Romanticism, or the Absolute Spirit as Sentiment.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 178. But the Romanticists, who followed close upon Fichte, were\\r\\ndissatisfied with so hard and exclusive a conception of spiritual being.\\r\\nLife, they said, is not all duty. Indeed, the true spiritual life is\\r\\nquite other, not harsh and constrained, but free and spontaneous--a\\r\\nwealth of feeling playing about a constantly shifting centre. Spirit is\\r\\nnot consecutive and law-abiding, but capricious and wanton, seeking the\\r\\nbeautiful in no orderly progression, but in a refined and versatile\\r\\nsensibility. If this be the nature of spirit, and if spirit be the\\r\\nnature of reality, then he is most wise who is most rich in sentiment.\\r\\nThe Romanticists were the exponents of an absolute sentimentalism. And\\r\\nthey did not prove it, but like good sentimentalists they felt it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Hegelianism, or the Absolute Spirit as Dialectic.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 179. Hegel, the master of the new idealism, set himself the task of\\r\\nconstruing spirit in terms as consecutive as those of Fichte, and as\\r\\ncomprehensive as those of the Romanticists. Like Plato, he found in\\r\\ndialectic the supreme manifestation of the spiritual life. There is a\\r\\ncertain flow of ideas which determines the meaning of experience, and\\r\\nis the truth of truths. But the mark of the new prophet is this: the\\r\\nflow of ideas itself is _a process of self-correction due to a sense of\\r\\nerror_. Thus bare sensation is abstract and bare thought is abstract.\\r\\nThe real, however, is not merely the concrete in which they are united,\\r\\nbut the very process in the course of which through knowledge of\\r\\nabstraction thought arrives at the concrete. The principle of negation\\r\\nis the very life of thought, and it is _the life of thought_, rather\\r\\nthan the outcome of thought, which is reality. The most general form of\\r\\nthe dialectical process contains three moments: the moment of _thesis_,\\r\\nin which affirmation is made; the moment of _antithesis_, in which the\\r\\nopposite asserts itself; and the moment of _synthesis_, in which a\\r\\nreconciliation is effected in a new thesis. Thus thought is the\\r\\nprogressive overcoming of contradiction; not the state of freedom from\\r\\ncontradiction, but the act of escaping it. Such processes are more\\r\\nfamiliar in the moral life. Morality consists, so even common-sense\\r\\nasserts, in the overcoming of evil. Character is the resistance of\\r\\ntemptation; goodness, a growth in grace through discipline. Of such, for\\r\\nHegel, is the very kingdom of heaven. It is the task of the philosopher,\\r\\na task to which Hegel applies himself most assiduously, to analyze the\\r\\nbattle and the victory upon which spiritual being nourishes itself. And\\r\\nsince the deeper processes are those of thought, the Hegelian philosophy\\r\\ncentres in an ordering of notions, a demonstration of that necessary\\r\\nprogression of thought which, in its whole dynamical logical history,\\r\\nconstitutes the _absolute idea_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Hegelian Philosophy of Nature and History.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 180. The Hegelian philosophy, with its emphasis upon difference,\\r\\nantagonism, and development, is peculiarly qualified to be a philosophy\\r\\nof nature and history. Those principles of spiritual development which\\r\\nlogic defines are conceived as incarnate in the evolution of the world.\\r\\nNature, as the very antithesis to spirit, is now understood to be the\\r\\nfoil of spirit. In nature spirit alienates itself in order to return\\r\\nenriched. The stages of nature are the preparation for the reviving of a\\r\\nspirituality that has been deliberately forfeited. The Romanticists,\\r\\nwhether philosophers like Schelling or poets like Goethe and Wordsworth,\\r\\nwere led by their feeling for the beauty of nature to attribute to it a\\r\\nmuch deeper and more direct spiritual significance. But Hegel and the\\r\\nRomanticists alike are truly expressed in Emerson\\'s belief that the\\r\\nspiritual interpretation of nature is the \"true science.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry, vegetation, and\\r\\n     animation, for he does not stop at these facts, but employs\\r\\n     them as signs. He knows why the plain or meadow of space was\\r\\n     strown with these flowers we call suns and moons and stars;\\r\\n     why the great deep is adorned with animals, with men, and\\r\\n     gods; for in every word he speaks he rides on them as the\\r\\n     horses of thought.\"[364:5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new awakening of spirit which is for Hegel the consummation of the\\r\\nnatural evolution, begins with the individual or _subjective_ spirit,\\r\\nand develops into the social or _objective_ spirit, which is morality\\r\\nand history. History is a veritable dialectic of nations, in the course\\r\\nof which the consciousness of individual liberty is developed, and\\r\\nco\\xc3\\xb6rdinated with the unity of the state. The highest stage of spirit\\r\\nincarnate is that of _absolute_ spirit, embracing art, religion, and\\r\\nphilosophy. In art the absolute idea obtains expression in sensuous\\r\\nexistence, more perfectly in classical than in the symbolic art of the\\r\\nOrient, but most perfectly in the romantic art of the modern period. In\\r\\nreligion the absolute idea is expressed in the imagination through\\r\\nworship. In Oriental pantheism, the individual is overwhelmed by his\\r\\nsense of the universal; in Greek religion, God is but a higher man;\\r\\nwhile in Christianity God and man are perfectly united in Christ.\\r\\nFinally, in philosophy the absolute idea reaches its highest possible\\r\\nexpression in articulate thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: R\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9. Failure of Absolute Idealism to Solve the Problem of\\r\\nEvil.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 181. Such is absolute idealism approached from the stand-point of\\r\\nantecedent metaphysics. It is the most elaborate and subtle provision\\r\\nfor antagonistic differences within unity that the speculative mind of\\r\\nman has as yet been able to make. It is the last and most thorough\\r\\nattempt to resolve individual and universal, temporal and eternal,\\r\\nnatural and ideal, good and evil, into an absolute unity in which the\\r\\nuniversal, eternal, ideal, and good shall dominate, and in which all\\r\\nterms shall be related with such necessity as obtains in the definitions\\r\\nand theorems of geometry. There is to be some absolute meaning which is\\r\\nrational to the uttermost and the necessary ground of all the incidents\\r\\nof existence. Thought could undertake no more ambitious and exacting\\r\\ntask. Nor is it evident after all that absolute idealism enjoys any\\r\\nbetter success in this task than absolute realism. The difference\\r\\nbetween them becomes much less marked when we reflect that the former,\\r\\nlike the latter, must reserve the predicate of being for the unity of\\r\\nthe whole. Even though evil and contradiction belong to the essence of\\r\\nthings, move in the secret heart of a spiritual universe, the reality is\\r\\nnot these in their severalty, but that life within which they fall, the\\r\\nstory within which they \"earn a place.\" And if absolute idealism has\\r\\ndefined a new perfection, it has at the same time defined a new\\r\\nimperfection. The perfection is rich in contrast, and thus inclusive of\\r\\nboth the lights and shades of experience; but the perfection belongs\\r\\nonly to the composition of these elements within a single view. It is\\r\\nnot necessary to such perfection that the evil should ever be viewed in\\r\\nisolation. The idealist employs the analogy of the drama or the picture\\r\\nwhose very significance requires the balance of opposing forces; or the\\r\\nanalogy of the symphony in which a higher musical quality is realized\\r\\nthrough the resolution of discord into harmony. But none of these\\r\\nunities requires any element whatsoever that does not partake of its\\r\\nbeauty. It is quite irrelevant to the drama that the hero should\\r\\nhimself have his own view of events with no understanding of their\\r\\ndramatic value, as it is irrelevant to the picture that an unbalanced\\r\\nfragment of it should dwell apart, or to the symphony that the discord\\r\\nshould be heard without the harmony. One may multiply without end the\\r\\ninternal differences and antagonisms that contribute to the internal\\r\\nmeaning, and be as far as ever from understanding the external\\r\\ndetachment of experiences that are not rational or good in themselves.\\r\\nAnd it is precisely this kind of fact that precipitates the whole\\r\\nproblem. We do not judge of sin and error from experiences in which they\\r\\nconduct to goodness and truth, but from experiences in which they are\\r\\nstark and unresolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn view of such considerations many idealists have been willing to\\r\\nconfess their inability to solve this problem. To quote a recent\\r\\nexpositor of Hegel,\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We need not, after all, be surprised at the apparently\\r\\n     insoluble problem which confronts us. For the question has\\r\\n     developed into the old difficulty of the origin of evil, which\\r\\n     has always baffled both theologians and philosophers. An\\r\\n     idealism which declares that the universe is in reality\\r\\n     perfect, can find, as most forms of popular idealism do, an\\r\\n     escape from the difficulties of the existence of evil, by\\r\\n     declaring that the universe is as yet only growing towards its\\r\\n     ideal perfection. But this refuge disappears with the reality\\r\\n     of time, and we are left with an awkward difference between\\r\\n     what philosophy tells us must be, and what our life tells us\\r\\n     actually is.\"[368:6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the philosophy of eternal perfection persists in its fundamental\\r\\ndoctrine in spite of this irreconcilable conflict with life, it is\\r\\nbecause it is believed that that doctrine _must_ be true. Let us turn,\\r\\nthen, to its more constructive and compelling argument.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Constructive Argument for Absolute Idealism is Based upon\\r\\nthe Subjectivistic Theory of Knowledge.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 182. The proof of absolute idealism is supposed by the majority of its\\r\\nexponents to follow from the problem of epistemology, and more\\r\\nparticularly from the manifest dependence of truth upon the knowing\\r\\nmind. In its initial phase absolute idealism is indistinguishable from\\r\\nsubjectivism. Like that philosophy it finds that the object of knowledge\\r\\nis inseparable from the state of knowledge throughout the whole range of\\r\\nexperience. Since the knower can never escape himself, it may be set\\r\\ndown as an elementary fact that reality (at any rate whatever reality\\r\\ncan be known or even talked about) owes its being to mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Green, the English neo-Hegelian, maintains that \"an object which\\r\\nno consciousness presented to itself would not be an object at all,\" and\\r\\nwonders that this principle is not generally taken for granted and made\\r\\nthe starting-point for philosophy.[369:7] However, unless the very term\\r\\n\"object\" is intended to imply presence to a subject, this principle is\\r\\nby no means self-evident, and must be traced to its sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have already followed the fortunes of that empirical subjectivism\\r\\nwhich issues from the relativity of perception. At the very dawn of\\r\\nphilosophy it was observed that what is seen, heard, or otherwise\\r\\nexperienced through the senses, depends not only upon the use of\\r\\nsense-organs, but upon the special point of view occupied by each\\r\\nindividual sentient being. It was therefore concluded that the\\r\\nperceptual world belonged to the human knower with his limitations and\\r\\nperspective, rather than to being itself. It was this epistemological\\r\\nprinciple upon which Berkeley founded his empirical idealism. Believing\\r\\nknowledge to consist essentially in perception, and believing perception\\r\\nto be subjective, he had to choose between the relegation of being to a\\r\\nregion inaccessible to knowledge, and the definition of being in terms\\r\\nof subjectivity. To avoid scepticism he accepted the latter alternative.\\r\\nBut among the Greeks with whom this theory of perception originated, it\\r\\ndrew its meaning in large part from the distinction between perception\\r\\nand reason. Thus we read in Plato\\'s \"Sophist\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And you would allow that we participate in generation with\\r\\n     the body, and by perception; but we participate with the soul\\r\\n     by thought in true essence, and essence you would affirm to be\\r\\n     always the same and immutable, whereas generation\\r\\n     varies.\"[370:8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is conceived that although in perception man is condemned to a\\r\\nknowledge conditioned by the affections and station of his body, he may\\r\\nnevertheless escape himself and lay hold on the \"true essence\" of\\r\\nthings, by virtue of thought. In other words, knowledge, in\\r\\ncontradistinction to \"opinion,\" is not made by the subject, but is the\\r\\nsoul\\'s participation in the eternal natures of things. In the moment of\\r\\ninsight the varying course of the individual thinker coincides with the\\r\\nunvarying truth; but in that moment the individual thinker is ennobled\\r\\nthrough being assimilated to the truth, while the truth is no more, no\\r\\nless, the truth than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Principle of Subjectivism Extended to Reason.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 183. In absolute idealism, the principle of subjectivism is extended\\r\\nto reason itself. This extension seems to have been originally due to\\r\\nmoral and religious interests. From the moral stand-point the\\r\\ncontemplation of the truth is a _state_, and the highest state of the\\r\\nindividual life. The religious interest unifies the individual life and\\r\\ndirects attention to its spiritual development. Among the Greeks of the\\r\\nmiddle period life was as yet viewed objectively as the fulfilment of\\r\\ncapacities, and knowledge was regarded as perfection of function, the\\r\\nexercise of the highest of human prerogatives. But as moral and\\r\\nreligious interests became more absorbing, the individual lived more and\\r\\nmore in his own self-consciousness. Even before the Christian era the\\r\\nGreek philosophers themselves were preoccupied with the task of winning\\r\\na state of inner serenity. Thus the Stoics and Epicureans came to look\\r\\nupon knowledge as a means to the attainment of an inner freedom from\\r\\ndistress and bondage to the world. In other words, the very reason was\\r\\nregarded as an activity of the self, and its fruits were valued for\\r\\ntheir enhancement of the welfare of the self. And if this be true of the\\r\\nStoics and the Epicureans, it is still more clearly true of the\\r\\nneo-Platonists of the Christian era, who mediate between the ancient\\r\\nand medi\\xc3\\xa6val worlds.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Emphasis on Self-consciousness in Early Christian\\r\\nPhilosophy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 184. It is well known that the early period of Christianity was a\\r\\nperiod of the most vivid self-consciousness. The individual believed\\r\\nthat his natural and social environment was alien to his deeper\\r\\nspiritual interests. He therefore withdrew into himself. He believed\\r\\nhimself to have but one duty, the salvation of his soul; and that duty\\r\\nrequired him to search his innermost springs of action in order to\\r\\nuproot any that might compromise him with the world and turn him from\\r\\nGod. The drama of life was enacted within the circle of his own\\r\\nself-consciousness. Citizenship, bodily health, all forms of\\r\\nappreciation and knowledge, were identified in the parts they played\\r\\nhere. In short the Christian consciousness, although renunciation was\\r\\nits deepest motive, was reflexive and centripetal to a degree hitherto\\r\\nunknown among the European peoples. And when with St. Augustine\\r\\ntheoretical interests once more vigorously asserted themselves, this new\\r\\nemphasis was in the very foreground. St. Augustine wished to begin his\\r\\nsystem of thought with a first indubitable certainty, and selected\\r\\nneither being nor ideas, but _self_. St. Augustine\\'s genius was\\r\\nprimarily religious, and the \"Confessions,\" in which he records the\\r\\nstory of his hard winning of peace and right relations with God, is his\\r\\nmost intimate book. How faithfully does he represent himself, and the\\r\\nblend of paganism and Christianity which was distinctive of his age,\\r\\nwhen in his systematic writings he draws upon religion for his knowledge\\r\\nof truth! In all my living, he argues, whether I sin or turn to God,\\r\\nwhether I doubt or believe, whether I know or am ignorant, in all _I\\r\\nknow that I am I_. Each and every state of my consciousness is a state\\r\\nof my self, and as such, sure evidence of my self\\'s existence. If one\\r\\nwere to follow St. Augustine\\'s reflections further, one would find him\\r\\nreasoning from his own finite and evil self to an infinite and perfect\\r\\nSelf, which centres like his in the conviction that I am I, but is\\r\\nendowed with all power and all worth. One would find him reflecting upon\\r\\nthe possible union with God through the exaltation of the human\\r\\nself-consciousness. But this conception of God as the perfect self is so\\r\\nmuch a prophecy of things to come, that more than a dozen centuries\\r\\nelapsed before it was explicitly formulated by the post-Kantians. We\\r\\nmust follow its more gradual development in the philosophies of\\r\\nDescartes and Kant.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Descartes\\'s Argument for the Independence of the Thinking\\r\\nSelf.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 185. When at the close of the sixteenth century the Frenchman, Ren\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\nDescartes, sought to construct philosophy anew and upon secure\\r\\nfoundations, he too selected as the initial certainty of thought the\\r\\nthinker\\'s knowledge of himself. This principle now received its classic\\r\\nformulation in the proposition, _Cogito ergo sum_--\"I think, hence I\\r\\nam.\" The argument does not differ essentially from that of St.\\r\\nAugustine, but it now finds a place in a systematic and critical\\r\\nmetaphysics. In that my thinking is certain of itself, says Descartes,\\r\\nin that I know myself before I know aught else, my self can never be\\r\\ndependent for its being upon anything else that I may come to know. A\\r\\nthinking self, with its knowledge and its volition, is quite capable of\\r\\nsubsisting of itself. Such is, indeed, not the case with a finite self,\\r\\nfor all finitude is significant of limitation, and in recognizing my\\r\\nlimitations I postulate the infinite being or God. But the relation of\\r\\nmy self to a physical world is quite without necessity. Human nature,\\r\\nwith soul and body conjoined, is a combination of two substances,\\r\\nneither of which is a necessary consequence of the other. As a result\\r\\nof this combination the soul is to some extent affected by the body, and\\r\\nthe body is to some extent directed by the soul; but the body could\\r\\nconceivably be an automaton, as the soul could conceivably be, and will\\r\\nin another life become, a free spirit. The consequences of this dualism\\r\\nfor epistemology are very grave. If knowledge be the activity of a\\r\\nself-subsistent thinking spirit, how can it reveal the nature of an\\r\\nexternal world? The natural order is now literally \"external.\" It is\\r\\ntrue that the whole body of exact science, that mechanical system to\\r\\nwhich Descartes attached so much importance, falls within the range of\\r\\nthe soul\\'s own thinking. But what assurance is there that it refers to a\\r\\nprovince of its own--a physical world in space? Descartes can only\\r\\nsuppose that \"clear and distinct\" ideas must be trusted as faithful\\r\\nrepresentations. It is true the external world makes its presence known\\r\\ndirectly, when it breaks in upon the soul in sense-perception. But\\r\\nDescartes\\'s rationalism and love of mathematics forbade his attaching\\r\\nimportance to this criterion. Real nature, that exactly definable and\\r\\npredictable order of moving bodies defined in physics, is not known\\r\\nthrough sense-perception, but through thought. Its necessities are the\\r\\nnecessities of reason. Descartes finds himself, then, in the perplexing\\r\\nposition of seeking an internal criterion for an external world. The\\r\\nproblem of knowledge so stated sets going the whole epistemological\\r\\nmovement of the eighteenth century, from Locke through Berkeley and Hume\\r\\nto Kant. And the issue of this development is the absolute idealism of\\r\\nKant\\'s successors.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Empirical Reaction of the English Philosophers.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 186. Of the English philosophers who prepare the way for the\\r\\nepistemology of Kant, Hume is the most radical and momentous. It was he\\r\\nwho roused Kant from his \"dogmatic slumbers\" to the task of the\\r\\n\"Critical Philosophy.\" Hume is one of the two possible consequences of\\r\\nDescartes. One who attaches greater importance to the rational\\r\\nnecessities of science than to its external reference, is not unwilling\\r\\nthat nature should be swallowed up in mind. With Malebranche,\\r\\nDescartes\\'s immediate successor in France, nature is thus provided for\\r\\nwithin the archetypal mind of God. With the English philosophers, on the\\r\\nother hand, externality is made the very mark of nature, and as a\\r\\nconsequence sense-perception becomes the criterion of scientific truth.\\r\\nThis empirical theory of knowledge, inaugurated and developed by Locke\\r\\nand Berkeley, culminates in Hume\\'s designation of the _impression_ as\\r\\nthe distinguishing element of nature, at once making up its content and\\r\\ncertifying to its externality. The processes of nature are successions\\r\\nof impressions; and the laws of nature are their uniformities, or the\\r\\nexpectations of uniformity which their repetitions engender. Hume does\\r\\nnot hesitate to draw the logical conclusion. If the final mark of truth\\r\\nis the presence to sense of the individual element, then science can\\r\\nconsist only of items of information and probable generalizations\\r\\nconcerning their sequences. The effect is observed to follow upon the\\r\\ncause in fact, but there is no understanding of its necessity; therefore\\r\\nno absolute certainty attaches to the future effects of any cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: To Save Exact Science Kant Makes it Dependent on Mind.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 187. But what has become of the dream of the mathematical physicist?\\r\\nIs the whole system of Newton, that brilliant triumph of the mechanical\\r\\nmethod, unfounded and dogmatic? It is the logical instability of this\\r\\nbody of knowledge, made manifest in the well-founded scepticism of Hume,\\r\\nthat rouses Kant to a re\\xc3\\xabxamination of the whole foundation of natural\\r\\nscience. The general outline of his analysis has been developed above.\\r\\nIt is of importance here to understand its relations to the problem of\\r\\nDescartes. Contrary to the view of the English philosophers, natural\\r\\nscience is, says Kant, the work of the mind. The certainty of the causal\\r\\nrelation is due to the human inability to think otherwise. Hume is\\r\\nmistaken in supposing that mere sensation gives us any knowledge of\\r\\nnature. The very least experience of objects involves the employment of\\r\\nprinciples which are furnished by the mind. Without the employment of\\r\\nsuch principles, or in bare sensation, there is no intelligible meaning\\r\\nwhatsoever. But once admit the employment of such principles and\\r\\nformulate them systematically, and the whole Newtonian order of nature\\r\\nis seen to follow from them. Furthermore, since these principles or\\r\\ncategories are the conditions of human experience, are the very\\r\\ninstruments of knowledge, they are valid wherever there is any\\r\\nexperience or knowledge. There is but one way to make anything at all\\r\\nout of nature, and that is to conceive it as an order of necessary\\r\\nevents in space and time. Newtonian science is part of such a general\\r\\nconception, and is therefore necessary if knowledge is to be possible at\\r\\nall, even the least. Thus Kant turns upon Hume, and shuts him up to the\\r\\nchoice between the utter abnegation of all knowledge, including the\\r\\nknowledge of his own scepticism, and the acceptance of the whole body of\\r\\nexact science.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with nature thus conditioned by the necessities of thought, what has\\r\\nbecome of its externality? That, Kant admits, has indeed vanished. Kant\\r\\ndoes not attempt, as did Descartes, to hold that the nature which mind\\r\\nconstructs and controls, exists also outside of mind. The nature that is\\r\\nknown is on that very account phenomenal, anthropocentric--created by\\r\\nits cognitive conditions. Descartes was right in maintaining that\\r\\nsense-perception certifies to the existence of a world outside the mind,\\r\\nbut mistaken in calling it nature and identifying it with the realm of\\r\\nscience. In short, Kant acknowledges the external world, and names it\\r\\nthe _thing-in-itself_; but insists that because it is outside of mind it\\r\\nis outside of knowledge. Thus is the certainty of science saved at the\\r\\ncost of its metaphysical validity. It is necessarily true, but only of a\\r\\nconditioned or dependent world. And in saving science Kant has at the\\r\\nsame time prejudiced metaphysics in general. For the human or\\r\\nnaturalistic way of knowing is left in sole possession of the field,\\r\\nwith the higher interest of reasons in the ultimate nature of being,\\r\\ndegraded to the rank of practical faith.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Post-Kantians Transform Kant\\'s Mind-in-general into an\\r\\nAbsolute Mind.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 188. The transformation of this critical and agnostic doctrine into\\r\\nabsolute idealism is inevitable. The metaphysical interest was bound to\\r\\navail itself of the speculative suggestiveness with which the Kantian\\r\\nphilosophy abounds. The transformation turns upon Kant\\'s assumption that\\r\\nwhatever is constructed by the mind is on that account phenomenon or\\r\\nappearance. Kant has carried along the presumption that whatever is act\\r\\nor content of mind is on that account not _real_ object or\\r\\n_thing-in-itself_. We have seen that this is generally accepted as true\\r\\nof the relativities of sense-perception. But is it true of thought? The\\r\\npost-Kantian idealist maintains that _that depends upon the thought_.\\r\\nThe content of private individual thinking is in so far not real object;\\r\\nbut it does not follow that this is true of such thinking as is\\r\\nuniversally valid. Now Kant has deduced his categories for thought in\\r\\ngeneral. There are no empirical cases of thinking except the human\\r\\nthinkers; but the categories are not the property of any one human\\r\\nindividual or any group of such individuals. They are the conditions of\\r\\n_experience in general_, and of every possibility of experience. The\\r\\ntransition to absolute idealism is now readily made. _Thought in\\r\\ngeneral_ becomes the _absolute mind_, and experience in general its\\r\\ncontent. The thing-in-itself drops out as having no meaning. The\\r\\nobjectivity to which it testified is provided for in the completeness\\r\\nand self-sufficiency which is attributed to the absolute experience.\\r\\nIndeed, an altogether new definition of subjective and objective\\r\\nreplaces the old. The subjective is that which is only insufficiently\\r\\nthought, as in the case of relativity and error; the objective is that\\r\\nwhich is completely thought. Thus the natural order is indeed\\r\\nphenomenal; but only because the principles of science are not the\\r\\nhighest principles of thought, and not because nature is the fruit of\\r\\nthought. Thus Hegel expresses his relation to Kant as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"According to Kant, the things that we know about are _to us_\\r\\n     appearances only, and we can never know their essential\\r\\n     nature, which belongs to another world, which we cannot\\r\\n     approach. . . . The true statement of the case is as follows.\\r\\n     The things of which we have direct consciousness are mere\\r\\n     phenomena, not for us only, but in their own nature; and the\\r\\n     true and proper case of these things, finite as they are, is\\r\\n     to have their existence founded not in themselves, but in the\\r\\n     universal divine idea. This view of things, it is true, is as\\r\\n     idealist as Kant\\'s, but in contradistinction to the\\r\\n     subjective idealism of the Critical Philosophy should be\\r\\n     termed Absolute Idealism.\"[382:9]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Direct Argument. The Inference from the Finite Mind to\\r\\nthe Infinite Mind.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 189. Absolute idealism is thus reached after a long and devious course\\r\\nof development. But the argument may be stated much more briefly. Plato,\\r\\nit will be remembered, found that experience tends ever to transcend\\r\\nitself. The thinker finds himself compelled to pursue the ideal of\\r\\nimmutable and universal truth, and must identify the ultimate being with\\r\\nthat ideal. Similarly Hegel says:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"That upward spring of the mind signifies that the being which\\r\\n     the world has is only a semblance, no real being, no absolute\\r\\n     truth; it signifies that beyond and above that appearance,\\r\\n     truth abides in God, so that true being is another name for\\r\\n     God.\"[382:10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe further argument of absolute idealism differs from that of Plato in\\r\\nthat the dependence of truth upon the mind is accepted as a first\\r\\nprinciple. The ideal with which experience is informed is now _the state\\r\\nof perfect knowledge_, rather than the system of absolute truth. The\\r\\ncontent of the state of perfect knowledge will indeed be the system of\\r\\nabsolute truth, but none the less _content_, precisely as finite\\r\\nknowledge is the content of a finite mind. In pursuing the truth, I who\\r\\npursue, aim to realize in myself a certain highest state of knowledge.\\r\\nWere I to know all truth I should indeed have ceased to be the finite\\r\\nindividual who began the quest, but the evolution would be continuous\\r\\nand the character of self-consciousness would never have been lost. I\\r\\nmay say, in short, that God or being, is my perfect cognitive self.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument for absolute idealism is a constructive interpretation of\\r\\nthe subjectivistic contention that knowledge can never escape the circle\\r\\nof its own activity and states. To meet the demand for a final and\\r\\nstandard truth, a demand which realism meets with its doctrine of a\\r\\nbeing independent of any mind, this philosophy defines a _standard\\r\\nmind_. The impossibility of defining objects in terms of relativity to a\\r\\nfinite self, conducts dialectically to the conception of the _absolute\\r\\nself_. The sequel to my error or exclusiveness, is truth or\\r\\ninclusiveness. The outcome of the dialectic is determined by the\\r\\nsymmetry of the antithesis. Thus, corrected experience implies a last\\r\\ncorrecting experience; partial cognition, complete cognition; empirical\\r\\nsubject, transcendental subject; finite mind, an absolute mind. The\\r\\nfollowing statement is taken from a contemporary exponent of the\\r\\nphilosophy:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"What you and I lack, when we lament our human ignorance, is\\r\\n     simply a certain desirable and logically possible state of\\r\\n     mind, or type of experience; to wit, a state of mind in which\\r\\n     we should wisely be able to say that we had fulfilled in\\r\\n     experience what we now have merely in idea, namely, the\\r\\n     knowledge, the immediate and felt presence, of what we now\\r\\n     call the Absolute Reality. . . . There is an Absolute\\r\\n     Experience for which the conception of an absolute reality,\\r\\n     _i. e._, the conception of a system of ideal truth, is\\r\\n     fulfilled by the very contents that get presented to this\\r\\n     experience. This Absolute Experience is related to our\\r\\n     experience as an organic whole to its own fragments. It is an\\r\\n     experience which finds fulfilled all that the completest\\r\\n     thought can conceive as genuinely possible. Herein lies its\\r\\n     definition as an Absolute. For the Absolute Experience, as for\\r\\n     ours, there are data, contents, facts. But these data, these\\r\\n     contents, express, for the Absolute Experience, its own\\r\\n     meaning, its thought, its ideas. Contents beyond these that it\\r\\n     possesses, the Absolute Experience knows to be, in genuine\\r\\n     truth, impossible. Hence its contents are indeed\\r\\n     particular,--a selection from the world of bare or merely\\r\\n     conceptual possibilities,--but they form a self-determined\\r\\n     whole, than which nothing completer, more organic, more\\r\\n     fulfilled, more transparent, or more complete in meaning, is\\r\\n     concretely or genuinely possible. On the other hand, these\\r\\n     contents are not foreign to those of our finite experience,\\r\\n     but are inclusive of them in the unity of one life.\"[385:11]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Realistic Tendency in Absolute Idealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 190. As has been already intimated, at the opening of this chapter,\\r\\nthe inclusion of the whole of reality within a single self is clearly a\\r\\nquestionable proceeding. The need of avoiding the relativism of\\r\\nempirical idealism is evident. But if the very meaning of the\\r\\nself-consciousness be due to a certain selection and exclusion within\\r\\nthe general field of experience, it is equally evident that the\\r\\nrelativity of self-consciousness can never be overcome through appealing\\r\\nto a higher self. One must appeal _from_ the self to the realm of things\\r\\nas they are. Indeed, although the exponents of this philosophy use the\\r\\nlanguage of spiritualism, and accept the idealistic epistemology, their\\r\\nabsolute being tends ever to escape the special characters of the self.\\r\\nAnd inasmuch as the absolute self is commonly set over against the\\r\\nfinite or empirical self, as the standard and test of truth, it is the\\r\\nless distinguishable from the realist\\'s order of independent beings.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Conception of Self-consciousness Central in the Ethics of\\r\\nAbsolute Idealism. Kant.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 191. But however much absolute idealism may tend to abandon its\\r\\nidealism for the sake of its absolutism within the field of metaphysics,\\r\\nsuch is not the case within the field of ethics and religion. The\\r\\nconception of the self here receives a new emphasis. The same\\r\\nself-consciousness which admits to the highest truth is the evidence of\\r\\nman\\'s practical dignity. In virtue of his immediate apprehension of the\\r\\nprinciples of selfhood, and his direct participation in the life of\\r\\nspirit, man may be said to possess the innermost secret of the universe.\\r\\nIn order to achieve goodness he must therefore recognize and express\\r\\n_himself_. The Kantian philosophy is here again the starting-point. It\\r\\nwas Kant who first gave adequate expression to the Christian idea of the\\r\\nmoral self-consciousness.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"_Duty!_ Thou sublime and mighty name that dost embrace\\r\\n     nothing charming or insinuating, but requirest submission, and\\r\\n     yet seekest not to move the will by threatening aught that\\r\\n     would arouse natural aversion or terror, but merely holdest\\r\\n     forth a law which of itself finds entrance into the mind,\\r\\n     . . . a law before which all inclinations are dumb, even\\r\\n     though they secretly counterwork it; what origin is there\\r\\n     worthy of thee, and where is to be found the root of thy noble\\r\\n     descent which proudly rejects all kindred with the\\r\\n     inclinations . . . ? It can be nothing less than a power which\\r\\n     elevates man above himself, . . . a power which connects him\\r\\n     with an order of things that only the understanding can\\r\\n     conceive, with a world which at the same time commands the\\r\\n     whole sensible world, and with it the empirically determinable\\r\\n     existence of man in time, as well as the sum total of all\\r\\n     ends.\"[387:12]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Kant there can be no morality except conduct be attended by the\\r\\nconsciousness of this duty imposed by the higher nature upon the lower.\\r\\nIt is this very recognition of a deeper self, of a personality that\\r\\nbelongs to the sources and not to the consequences of nature, that\\r\\nconstitutes man as a moral being, and only such action as is inspired\\r\\nwith a reverence for it can be morally good. Kant does little more than\\r\\nto establish the uncompromising dignity of the moral will. In moral\\r\\naction man submits to a law that issues from himself in virtue of his\\r\\nrational nature. Here he yields nothing, as he owes nothing, to that\\r\\nappetency which binds him to the natural world. As a rational being he\\r\\nhimself affirms the very principles which determine the organization of\\r\\nnature. This is his _freedom_, at once the ground and the implication\\r\\nof his duty. Man is free from nature to serve the higher law of his\\r\\npersonality.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Kantian Ethics Supplemented through the Conceptions of\\r\\nUniversal and Objective Spirit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 192. There are two respects in which Kant\\'s ethics has been regarded\\r\\nas inadequate by those who draw from it their fundamental principles. It\\r\\nis said that Kant is too rigoristic, that he makes too stern a business\\r\\nof morality, in speaking so much of law and so little of love and\\r\\nspontaneity. There are good reasons for this. Kant seeks to isolate the\\r\\nmoral consciousness, and dwell upon it in its purity, in order that he\\r\\nmay demonstrate its incommensurability with the values of inclination\\r\\nand sensibility. Furthermore, Kant may speak of the principle of the\\r\\nabsolute, and recognize the deeper eternal order as a law, but he may\\r\\nnot, if he is to be consistent with his own critical principles, affirm\\r\\nthe metaphysical being of such an order. With his idealistic followers\\r\\nit is possible to define the spiritual setting of the moral life, but\\r\\nwith Kant it is only possible to define the antagonism of principles.\\r\\nHence the greater optimism of the post-Kantians. They know that the\\r\\nhigher law is the reality, and that he who obeys it thus unites himself\\r\\nwith the absolute self. That which for Kant is only a resolute\\r\\nobedience to more valid principles, to rationally superior rules for\\r\\naction, is for idealism man\\'s appropriation of his spiritual birthright.\\r\\nSince the law is the deeper nature, man may respect and obey it as\\r\\nvalid, and at the same time act upon it gladly in the sure knowledge\\r\\nthat it will enhance his eternal welfare. Indeed, the knowledge that the\\r\\nvery universe is founded upon this law will make him less suspicious of\\r\\nnature and less exclusive in his adherence to any single law. He will be\\r\\nmore confident of the essential goodness of all manifestations of a\\r\\nuniverse which he knows to be fundamentally spiritual.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it has been urged, secondly, that the Kantian ethics is too formal,\\r\\ntoo little pertinent to the issues of life. Kant\\'s moral law imposes\\r\\nonly obedience to the law, or conduct conceived as suitable to a\\r\\nuniversal moral community. But what is the nature of such conduct in\\r\\nparticular? It may be answered that to maintain the moral\\r\\nself-consciousness, to act dutifully and dutifully only, to be\\r\\nself-reliant and unswerving in the doing of what one ought to do, is to\\r\\nobtain a very specific character. But does this not leave the\\r\\nindividual\\'s conduct to his own interpretation of his duty? It was just\\r\\nthis element of individualism which Hegel sought to eliminate through\\r\\nthe application of his larger philosophical conception. If that which\\r\\nexpresses itself within the individual consciousness as the moral law be\\r\\nindeed the law of that self in which the universe is grounded, it will\\r\\nappear as _objective spirit_ in the evolution of society. For Hegel,\\r\\nthen, the most valid standard of goodness is to be found in that\\r\\ncustomary morality which bespeaks the moral leadings of the general\\r\\nhumanity, and in those institutions, such as the family and the state,\\r\\nwhich are the moral acts of the absolute idea itself. Finally, in the\\r\\nrealm of _absolute spirit_, in art, in revealed religion, and in\\r\\nphilosophy, the individual may approach to the self-consciousness which\\r\\nis the perfect truth and goodness in and for itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Peculiar Pantheism and Mysticism of Absolute Idealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 193. Where the law of life is the implication in the finite\\r\\nself-consciousness of the eternal and divine self-consciousness, there\\r\\ncan be no division between morality and religion, as there can be none\\r\\nbetween thought and will. Whatever man seeks is in the end God. As the\\r\\nperfect fulfilment of the thinking self, God is the truth; as the\\r\\nperfect fulfilment of the willing self, God is the good. The finite\\r\\nself-consciousness finds facts that are not understood, and so seeks to\\r\\nresolve itself into the perfect self wherein all that is given has\\r\\nmeaning. On the other hand, the finite self-consciousness finds ideals\\r\\nthat are not realized, and so seeks to resolve itself into that perfect\\r\\nself wherein all that is significant is given. All interests thus\\r\\nconverge toward\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"some state of conscious spirit in which the opposition of\\r\\n     cognition and volition is overcome--in which we neither judge\\r\\n     our ideas by the world, nor the world by our ideas, but are\\r\\n     aware that inner and outer are in such close and necessary\\r\\n     harmony that even the thought of possible discord has become\\r\\n     impossible. In its unity not only cognition and volition, but\\r\\n     feeling also, must be blended and united. In some way or\\r\\n     another it must have overcome the rift in discursive\\r\\n     knowledge, and the immediate must for it be no longer the\\r\\n     alien. It must be as direct as art, as certain and universal\\r\\n     as philosophy.\"[391:13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe religious consciousness proper to absolute idealism is both\\r\\npantheistic and mystical, but with distinction. Platonism is pantheistic\\r\\nin that nature is resolved into God. All that is not perfect is esteemed\\r\\nonly for its promise of perfection. And Platonism is mystical in that\\r\\nthe purification and universalization of the affections brings one in\\r\\nthe end to a perfection that exceeds all modes of thought and speech.\\r\\nWith Spinoza, on the other hand, God may be said to be resolved into\\r\\nnature. Nature is made divine, but is none the less nature, for its\\r\\ndivinity consists in its absolute necessity. Spinoza\\'s pantheism passes\\r\\nover into mysticism because the absolute necessity exceeds in both unity\\r\\nand richness the laws known to the human understanding. In absolute\\r\\nidealism, finally, both God and nature are resolved into the self. For\\r\\nthat which is divine in experience is self-consciousness, and this is at\\r\\nthe same time the ground of nature. Thus in the highest knowledge the\\r\\nself is expanded and enriched without being left behind. The mystical\\r\\nexperience proper to this philosophy is the consciousness of identity,\\r\\ntogether with the sense of universal immanence. The individual self may\\r\\nbe directly sensible of the absolute self, for these are one spiritual\\r\\nlife. Thus Emerson says:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"It is a secret which every intellectual man quickly learns,\\r\\n     that beyond the energy of his possessed and conscious\\r\\n     intellect he is capable of a new energy (as of an intellect\\r\\n     doubled on itself), by abandonment to the nature of things;\\r\\n     that beside his privacy of power as an individual man, there\\r\\n     is a great public power upon which he can draw, by unlocking,\\r\\n     at all risks, his human doors, and suffering the ethereal\\r\\n     tides to roll and circulate through him; then he is caught up\\r\\n     into the life of the Universe, his speech is thunder, his\\r\\n     thought is law, and his words are universally intelligible as\\r\\n     the plants and animals. The poet knows that he speaks\\r\\n     adequately then only when he speaks somewhat wildly, or \\'with\\r\\n     the flower of the mind\\'; not with the intellect used as an\\r\\n     organ, but with the intellect released from all service and\\r\\n     suffered to take its direction from its celestial\\r\\n     life.\"[393:14]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Religion of Exuberant Spirituality.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 194. But the distinguishing flavor and quality of this religion arises\\r\\nfrom its spiritual hospitality. It is not, like Platonism, a\\r\\ncontemplation of the best; nor, like pluralistic idealisms, a moral\\r\\nknight-errantry. It is neither a religion of exclusion, nor a religion\\r\\nof reconstruction, but a profound willingness that things should be as\\r\\nthey really are. For this reason its devotees have recognized in Spinoza\\r\\ntheir true forerunner. But idealism is not Spinozism, though it may\\r\\ncontain this as one of its strains. For it is not the worship of\\r\\nnecessity, Emerson\\'s \"beautiful necessity, which makes man brave in\\r\\nbelieving that he cannot shun a danger that is appointed, nor incur one\\r\\nthat is not\"; but the worship of _that which is_ necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only must one understand that every effort, however despairing, is\\r\\nan element of sense in the universal significance;\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"that the whole would not be what it is were not precisely\\r\\n     this finite purpose left in its own uniqueness to speak\\r\\n     precisely its own word--a word which no other purpose can\\r\\n     speak in the language of the divine will\";[394:15]\\r\\n\\r\\nbut one must have a zest for such participation, and a heart for the\\r\\ndivine will which it profits. Indeed, so much is this religion a love of\\r\\nlife, that it may, as in the case of the Romanticists, be a love of\\r\\ncaprice. Battle and death, pain and joy, error and truth--all that\\r\\nbelongs to the story of this mortal world, are to be felt as the thrill\\r\\nof health, and relished as the essences of God. Religion is an exuberant\\r\\nspirituality, a fearless sensibility, a knowledge of both good and evil,\\r\\nand a will to serve the good, while exulting that the evil will not\\r\\nyield without a battle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[349:1] By _Absolute Idealism_ is meant that system of philosophy which\\r\\ndefines the universe as the _absolute spirit_, which is the human\\r\\n_moral_, _cognitive_, or _appreciative consciousness_ universalized; or\\r\\nas the _absolute, transcendental mind_, whose state of _complete\\r\\nknowledge_ is implied in all finite thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n[352:2] Plato: _Tim\\xc3\\xa6us_, 29.

One who consults a book of philosophy in the hope of finding\\r\\nthere a definite body of truth, sanctioned by the consensus of experts,\\r\\ncannot fail to be disappointed. And it should now be plain that this is\\r\\ndue not to the frailties of philosophers, but to the meaning of\\r\\nphilosophy. Philosophy is not additive, but reconstructive. Natural\\r\\nscience may advance step by step without ever losing ground; its\\r\\nempirical discoveries are in their severalty as true as they can ever\\r\\nbe. Thus the stars and the species of animals may be recorded\\r\\nsuccessively, and each generation of astronomers and zo\\xc3\\xb6logists may take\\r\\nup the work at the point reached by its forerunners. The formulation of\\r\\nresults does, it is true, require constant correction and revision--but\\r\\nthere is a central body of data which is little affected, and which\\r\\naccumulates from age to age. Now the finality of scientific truth is\\r\\nproportional to the modesty of its claims. Items of truth persist,\\r\\nwhile the interpretation of them is subject to alteration with the\\r\\ngeneral advance of knowledge; and, relatively speaking, science consists\\r\\nin items of truth, and philosophy in their interpretation. The liability\\r\\nto revision in science itself increases as that body of knowledge\\r\\nbecomes more highly unified and systematic. Thus the present age, with\\r\\nits attempt to construct a single comprehensive system of mechanical\\r\\nscience, is peculiarly an age when fundamental conceptions are subjected\\r\\nto a thorough re\\xc3\\xabxamination--when, for example, so ancient a conception\\r\\nas that of matter is threatened with displacement by that of energy. But\\r\\nphilosophy is _essentially unitary and systematic_--and thus\\r\\n_superlatively liable to revision_.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The One Science and the Many Philosophies.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 196. It is noteworthy that it is only in this age of a highly\\r\\nsystematic natural science that _different_ systems are projected, as in\\r\\nthe case just noted of the rivalry between the strictly mechanical, or\\r\\ncorpuscular, theory and the newer theory of energetics. It has\\r\\nheretofore been taken for granted that although there may be many\\r\\nphilosophies, there is but one body of science. And it is still taken\\r\\nfor granted that the experimental detail of the individual science is a\\r\\ncommon fund, to the progressive increase of which the individual\\r\\nscientist contributes the results of his special research; there being\\r\\n_rival_ schools of mechanics, physics, or chemistry, only in so far as\\r\\n_fundamental conceptions_ or _principles of orderly arrangement_ are in\\r\\nquestion. But philosophy deals exclusively with the most fundamental\\r\\nconceptions and the most general principles of orderly arrangement.\\r\\nHence it is significant of the very task of philosophy that there should\\r\\nbe many tentative systems of philosophy, even that each philosopher\\r\\nshould project and construct his own philosophy. Philosophy as the truth\\r\\nof synthesis and reconciliation, of comprehensiveness and co\\xc3\\xb6rdination,\\r\\nmust be a living unity. It is a thinking of entire experience, and can\\r\\nbe sufficient only through being all-sufficient. The heart of every\\r\\nphilosophy is a harmonizing insight, an intellectual prospect within\\r\\nwhich all human interests and studies compose themselves. Such knowledge\\r\\ncannot be delegated to isolated co-laborers, but will be altogether\\r\\nmissed if not loved and sought in its indivisible unity. There is no\\r\\nmodest home-keeping philosophy; no safe and conservative philosophy,\\r\\nthat can make sure of a part through renouncing the whole. There is no\\r\\nphilosophy without intellectual temerity, as there is no religion\\r\\nwithout moral temerity. And the one is the supreme interest of thought,\\r\\nas the other is the supreme interest of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Progress in Philosophy. The Sophistication or Eclecticism of\\r\\nthe Present Age.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 197. Though the many philosophies be inevitable, it must not be\\r\\nconcluded that there is therefore no progress in philosophy. The\\r\\nsolution from which every great philosophy is precipitated is the\\r\\nmingled wisdom of some latest age, with all of its inheritance. The\\r\\n\"positive\" knowledge furnished by the sciences, the refinements and\\r\\ndistinctions of the philosophers, the ideals of society--these and the\\r\\nwhole sum of civilization are its ingredients. Where there is no single\\r\\nsystem of philosophy significant enough to express the age, as did the\\r\\nsystems of Plato, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Locke, Kant, Hegel, and the\\r\\nothers who belong to the roll of the great philosophers, there exists a\\r\\n_general sophistication_, which is more elusive but not less\\r\\nsignificant. The present age--at any rate from its own stand-point--is\\r\\nnot an age of great philosophical systems. Such systems may indeed be\\r\\nliving in our midst unrecognized; but historical perspective cannot\\r\\nsafely be anticipated. It is certain that no living voice is known to\\r\\nspeak for this generation as did Hegel, and even Spencer, for the last.\\r\\nThere is, however, a significance in this very passing of Hegel and\\r\\nSpencer,--an enlightenment peculiar to an age which knows them, but has\\r\\nphilosophically outlived them. There is a moral in the history of\\r\\nthought which just now no philosophy, whether naturalism, or\\r\\ntranscendentalism, realism or idealism, can fail to draw. The\\r\\ncharacterization of this contemporary eclecticism or sophistication,\\r\\ndifficult and uncertain as it must needs be, affords the best summary\\r\\nand interpretation with which to conclude this brief survey of the\\r\\nfortunes of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Metaphysics. The Antagonistic Doctrines of Naturalism and\\r\\nAbsolutism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 198. Since the problem of metaphysics is the crucial problem of\\r\\nphilosophy, the question of its present status is fundamental in any\\r\\ncharacterization of the age. It will appear from the foregoing account\\r\\nof the course of metaphysical development that two fundamental\\r\\ntendencies have exhibited themselves from the beginning. The one of\\r\\nthese is naturalistic and empirical, representing the claims of what\\r\\ncommon sense calls \"matters of fact\"; the other is transcendental and\\r\\nrational, representing the claims of the standards and ideals which are\\r\\nimmanent in experience, and directly manifested in the great human\\r\\ninterests of thought and action. These tendencies have on the whole been\\r\\nantagonistic; and the clear-cut and momentous systems of philosophy have\\r\\nbeen fundamentally determined by either the one or the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus materialism is due to the attempt to reduce all of experience to\\r\\nthe elements and principles of connection which are employed by the\\r\\nphysical sciences to set in order the actual motions, or changes of\\r\\nplace, which the parts of experience undergo. Materialism maintains that\\r\\nthe motions of bodies are indifferent to considerations of worth, and\\r\\ndenies that they issue from a deeper cause of another order. The very\\r\\nideas of such non-mechanical elements or principles are here provided\\r\\nwith a mechanical origin. Similarly a phenomenalism, like that of Hume,\\r\\ntakes immediate presence to sense as the norm of being and knowledge.\\r\\nIndividual items, directly verified in the moment of their occurrence,\\r\\nare held to be at once the content of all real truth, and the source of\\r\\nthose abstract ideas which the misguided rationalists mistake for real\\r\\ntruth.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the absolutist, on the other hand, contends that the thinker must\\r\\n_mean_ something by the reality which he seeks. If he had it for the\\r\\nlooking, thought would not be, as it so evidently is, a purposive\\r\\nendeavor. And that which is meant by reality can be nothing short of the\\r\\nfulfilment or final realization of this endeavor of thought. To find out\\r\\nwhat thought seeks, to anticipate the consummation of thought and posit\\r\\nit as real, is therefore the first and fundamental procedure of\\r\\nphilosophy. The mechanism of nature, and all matters of fact, must come\\r\\nto terms with this absolute reality, or be condemned as mere appearance.\\r\\nThus Plato distinguishes the world of \"generation\" in which we\\r\\nparticipate by perception, from the \"true essence\" in which we\\r\\nparticipate by thought; and Schelling speaks of the modern experimental\\r\\nmethod as the \"corruption\" of philosophy and physics, in that it fails\\r\\nto construe nature in terms of spirit.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Concessions from the Side of Absolutism. Recognition of\\r\\nNature. The Neo-Fichteans.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 199. Now it would never occur to a sophisticated philosopher of the\\r\\npresent, to one who has thought out to the end the whole tradition of\\r\\nphilosophy, and felt the gravity of the great historical issues, to\\r\\nsuffer either of these motives to dominate him to the exclusion of the\\r\\nother. Absolutism has long since ceased to speak slightingly of physical\\r\\nscience, and of the world of perception. It is conceded that motions\\r\\nmust be known in the mechanical way, and matters of fact in the\\r\\nmatter-of-fact way. Furthermore, the prestige which science enjoyed in\\r\\nthe nineteenth century, and the prestige which the empirical and secular\\r\\nworld of action has enjoyed to a degree that has steadily increased\\r\\nsince the Renaissance, have convinced the absolutist of the intrinsic\\r\\nsignificance of these parts of experience. They are no longer reduced,\\r\\nbut are permitted to flourish in their own right. From the very councils\\r\\nof absolute idealism there has issued a distinction which is fast\\r\\nbecoming current, between the World of Appreciation, or the realm of\\r\\nmoral and logical principles, and the World of Description, or the realm\\r\\nof empirical generalizations and mechanical causes.[402:1] It is indeed\\r\\nmaintained that the former of these is metaphysically superior; but the\\r\\nlatter is ranked without the disparagement of its own proper categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Fichteans this distinction corresponds to the distinction in\\r\\nthe system of Fichte between the active moral ego, and the nature which\\r\\nit posits to act upon. But the _neo-Fichteans_ are concerned to show\\r\\nthat the nature so posited, or the World of Description, is the _realm\\r\\nof mechanical science_, and that the entire system of mathematical and\\r\\nphysical truth is therefore morally necessary.[403:2]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Neo-Kantians.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 200. A more pronounced tendency in the same direction marks the work\\r\\nof the _neo-Kantians_. These philosophers repudiate the spiritualistic\\r\\nmetaphysics of Schopenhauer, Fichte, and Hegel, believing the real\\r\\nsignificance of Kant to lie in his critical method, in his examination\\r\\nof the first principles of the different systems of knowledge, and\\r\\nespecially in his analysis of the foundations of mathematics and\\r\\nphysics.[403:3] In approaching mathematics and physics from a general\\r\\nlogical stand-point, these neo-Kantians become scarcely distinguishable\\r\\nin interest and temper from those scientists who approach logic from the\\r\\nmathematical and physical stand-point.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Recognition of the Individual. Personal Idealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 201. The finite, moral individual, with his peculiar spiritual\\r\\nperspective, has long since been recognized as essential to the meaning\\r\\nof the universe rationally conceived. But in its first movement absolute\\r\\nidealism proposed to absorb him in the indivisible absolute self. It is\\r\\nnow pointed out that Fichte, and even Hegel himself, means the absolute\\r\\nto be a plurality or society of persons.[404:4] It is commonly conceded\\r\\nthat the will of the absolute must coincide with the wills of all finite\\r\\ncreatures in their severalty, that God wills in and through men.[404:5]\\r\\nCorresponding to this individualistic tendency on the part of absolute\\r\\nidealism, there has been recently projected a _personal idealism_, or\\r\\n_humanism_, which springs freshly and directly from the same motive.\\r\\nThis philosophy attributes ultimate importance to the human person with\\r\\nhis freedom, his interests, his control over nature, and his hope of the\\r\\nadvancement of the spiritual kingdom through co\\xc3\\xb6peration with his\\r\\nfellows.[405:6]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Concessions from the Side of Naturalism. Recognition of\\r\\nFundamental Principles.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 202. Naturalism exhibits a moderation and liberality that is not less\\r\\nstriking than that of absolutism. This abatement of its claims began in\\r\\nthe last century with agnosticism. It was then conceded that there is an\\r\\norder other than that of natural science; but this order was held to be\\r\\ninaccessible to human knowledge. Such a theory is essentially unstable\\r\\nbecause it employs principles which define a non-natural order, but\\r\\nrefuses to credit them or call them knowledge. The agnostic is in the\\r\\nparadoxical position of one who knows of an unknowable world.\\r\\nPresent-day naturalism is more circumspect. It has interested itself in\\r\\nbringing to light that in the very procedure of science which, because\\r\\nit predetermines what nature shall be, cannot be included within nature.\\r\\nTo this interest is due the rediscovery of the rational foundations of\\r\\nscience. It was already known in the seventeenth century that exact\\r\\nscience does not differ radically from mathematics, as mathematics does\\r\\nnot differ radically from logic. Mathematics and mechanics are now being\\r\\nsubmitted to a critical examination which reveals the definitions and\\r\\nimplications upon which they rest, and the general relation of these to\\r\\nthe fundamental elements and necessities of thought.[406:7]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Recognition of the Will. Pragmatism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 203. This rationalistic tendency in naturalism is balanced by a\\r\\ntendency which is more empirical, but equally subversive of the old\\r\\nultra-naturalism. Goethe once wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"I have observed that I hold that thought to be true which is\\r\\n     _fruitful for me_. . . . When I know my relation to myself and\\r\\n     to the outer world, I say that I possess the truth.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, it is now frequently observed that all knowledge is _humanly\\r\\nfruitful_, and it is proposed that this shall be regarded as the very\\r\\ncriterion of truth. According to this principle science as a whole, even\\r\\nknowledge as a whole, is primarily a human utility. The nature which\\r\\nscience defines is an artifact or construct. It is designed to express\\r\\nbriefly and conveniently what man may practically expect from his\\r\\nenvironment. This tendency is known as _pragmatism_. It ranges\\r\\nfrom systematic doctrines, reminiscent of Fichte, which seek to\\r\\ndefine practical needs and deduce knowledge from them, to the\\r\\nmore irresponsible utterances of those who liken science to\\r\\n\"shorthand,\"[407:8] and mathematics to a game of chess. In any case\\r\\npragmatism attributes to nature a certain dependence on will, and\\r\\ntherefore implies, even when it does not avow, that will with its\\r\\npeculiar principles or values cannot be reduced to the terms of nature.\\r\\nIn short, it would be more true to say that nature expresses will, than\\r\\nthat will expresses nature.[408:9]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Summary, and Transition to Epistemology.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 204. Such, then, is the contemporary eclecticism as respects the\\r\\ncentral problem of metaphysics. There are _naturalistic_ and\\r\\n_individualistic_ tendencies in _absolutism_; _rationalistic_ and\\r\\n_ethical_ tendencies in _naturalism_; and finally the independent and\\r\\nspontaneous movements of _personal idealism_ and _pragmatism_.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the rise of the Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy, metaphysics\\r\\nand epistemology have maintained relations so intimate that the present\\r\\nstate of the former cannot be characterized without some reference to\\r\\nthe present state of the latter. Indeed, the very issues upon which\\r\\nmetaphysicians divide are most commonly those provoked by the problem\\r\\nof knowledge. The counter-tendencies of naturalism and absolutism are\\r\\nalways connected, and often coincide with, the epistemological\\r\\nopposition between empiricism, which proclaims perception, and\\r\\nrationalism, which proclaims reason, to be the proper organ of\\r\\nknowledge. The other great epistemological controversy does not bear so\\r\\ndirect and simple a relation to the central metaphysical issues, and\\r\\nmust be examined on its own account.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Antagonistic Doctrines of Realism and Idealism. Realistic\\r\\nTendency in Empirical Idealism.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 205. The point of controversy is the dependence or independence of the\\r\\nobject of knowledge on the state of knowledge; idealism maintaining that\\r\\nreality _is_ the knower or his content of mind, realism, that being\\r\\nknown is a circumstance which appertains to some reality, without being\\r\\nthe indispensable condition of reality as such. Now the sophisticated\\r\\nthought of the present age exhibits a tendency on the part of these\\r\\nopposite doctrines to approach and converge. It has been already\\r\\nremarked that the empirical idealism of the Berkeleyan type could not\\r\\navoid transcending itself. Hume, who omitted Berkeley\\'s active spirits,\\r\\nno longer had any subjective seat or locus for the perceptions to which\\r\\nBerkeley had reduced the outer world. And perceptions which are not the\\r\\nstates of any subject, retain only their intrinsic character and become\\r\\na series of elements. When there is nothing beyond, which appears, and\\r\\nnothing within to which it appears, there ceases to be any sense in\\r\\nusing such terms as appearance, phenomenon, or impression. The term\\r\\nsensation is at present employed in the same ill-considered manner. But\\r\\nempirical idealism has come gradually to insist upon the importance of\\r\\nthe content of perception, rather than the relation of perception to a\\r\\nself as its state. The terms _element_ and _experience_, which are\\r\\nreplacing the subjectivistic terms, are frankly realistic.[410:10]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Realistic Tendency in Absolute Idealism. The Conception of\\r\\nExperience.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 206. There is a similar realistic trend in the development of absolute\\r\\nidealism. The pure Hegelian philosophy was notably objective. The\\r\\nprinciples of development in which it centres were conceived by Hegel\\r\\nhimself to manifest themselves most clearly in the progressions of\\r\\nnature and history. Many of Hegel\\'s followers have been led by moral and\\r\\nreligious interests to emphasize consciousness, and, upon\\r\\nepistemological grounds, to lay great stress upon the necessity of the\\r\\nunion of the parts of experience within an enveloping self. But absolute\\r\\nidealism has much at heart the overcoming of relativism, and the\\r\\nabsolute is defined in order to meet the demand for a being that shall\\r\\nnot have the cognitive deficiencies of an object of finite thought. So\\r\\nit is quite possible for this philosophy, while maintaining its\\r\\ntraditions on the whole, to abandon the term _self_ to the finite\\r\\nsubject, and regard its absolute as a system of rational and universal\\r\\nprinciples--self-sufficient because externally independent and\\r\\ninternally necessary. Hence the renewed study of categories as logical,\\r\\nmathematical, or mechanical principles, and entirely apart from their\\r\\nbeing the acts of a thinking self.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it has been recognized that the general demand of idealism\\r\\nis met when reality is regarded as not outside of or other than\\r\\nknowledge, whatever be true of the question of dependence. Thus the\\r\\nconception of _experience_ is equally convenient here, in that it\\r\\nsignifies what is immediately present in knowledge, without affirming it\\r\\nto _consist in_ being so presented.[411:11]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Idealistic Tendencies in Realism. The Immanence Philosophy.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 207. And at this point idealism is met by a latter-day realism. The\\r\\ntraditional modern realism springing from Descartes was dualistic. It\\r\\nwas supposed that reality in itself was essentially extra-mental, and\\r\\nthus under the necessity of being either represented or misrepresented\\r\\nin thought. But the one of these alternatives is dogmatic, in that\\r\\nthought can never test the validity of its relation to that which is\\r\\nperpetually outside of it; while the other is agnostic, providing only\\r\\nfor the knowledge of a world of appearance, an improper knowledge that\\r\\nis in fact not knowledge at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut realism is not necessarily dualistic, since it requires only that\\r\\nbeing shall not be dependent upon being known. Furthermore, since\\r\\nempiricism is congenial to naturalism, it is an easy step to say that\\r\\nnature is directly known in perception. This first takes the form of\\r\\npositivism, or the theory that only such nature as can be directly known\\r\\ncan be really known. But this agnostic provision for an unknown world\\r\\nbeyond, inevitably falls away and leaves _reality as that which is\\r\\ndirectly known, but not conditioned by knowledge_. Again the term\\r\\n_experience_ is the most useful, and provides a common ground for\\r\\n_idealistic realism_ with _realistic idealism_. A new epistemological\\r\\nmovement makes this conception of experience its starting-point. What is\\r\\nknown as the _immanence philosophy_ defines reality as experience, and\\r\\nmeans by experience the subject matter of all knowledge--not defined as\\r\\nsuch, but regarded as capable of being such. Experience is conceived to\\r\\nbe _both in and out_ of selves, cognition being but one of the special\\r\\nsystems into which experience may enter.[413:12]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Interpretation of Tradition as the Basis for a New\\r\\nConstruction.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 208. Does this eclecticism of the age open any philosophical prospect?\\r\\nIs it more than a general compromise--a confession of failure on the\\r\\npart of each and every radical and clear-cut doctrine of metaphysics and\\r\\nepistemology? There is no final answer to such a question short of an\\r\\nindependent construction, and such procedure would exceed the scope of\\r\\nthe present discussion. But there is an evident interpretation of\\r\\ntradition that suggests a possible basis for such construction.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Truth of the Physical System, but Failure of Attempt to\\r\\nReduce All Experience to it.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 209. Suppose it to be granted that the categories of nature are quite\\r\\nself-sufficient. This would mean that there might conceivably be a\\r\\nstrictly physical order, governed only by mechanical principles, and by\\r\\nthe more general logical and mathematical principles. The body of\\r\\nphysical science so extended as to include such general conceptions as\\r\\nidentity, difference, number, quality, space, and time, is the account\\r\\nof such an order. This order need have no value, and need not be known.\\r\\nBut reality as a whole is evidently not such a strictly physical order,\\r\\nfor the definition of the physical order involves the rejection of many\\r\\nof the most familiar aspects of experience, such as its value and its\\r\\nbeing known in conscious selves. Materialism, in that it proposes to\\r\\nconceive the whole of reality as physical, must attempt to reduce the\\r\\nresiduum to physical terms, and with no hope of success. Goodness and\\r\\nknowledge cannot be explained as mass and force, or shown to be\\r\\nmechanical necessities.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Truth of Psychical Relations, but Impossibility of General\\r\\nReduction to Them.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 210. Are we then to conclude that reality is not physical, and look\\r\\nfor other terms to which we may reduce physical terms? There is no lack\\r\\nof such other terms. Indeed, we could as fairly have _begun_ elsewhere.\\r\\nThus some parts of experience compose the consciousness of the\\r\\nindividual, and are said to be known by him. Experience so contained is\\r\\nconnected by the special relation of being known together. But this\\r\\nrelation is quite indifferent to physical, moral, and logical relations.\\r\\nThus we may be conscious of things which are physically disconnected,\\r\\nmorally repugnant, and logically contradictory, or in all of these\\r\\nrespects utterly irrelevant. Subjectivism, in that it proposes to\\r\\nconceive the whole of reality as consciousness, must attempt to reduce\\r\\nphysical, moral, and logical relations to that co-presence in\\r\\nconsciousness from which they are so sharply distinguished in their very\\r\\ndefinition. The historical failure of this attempt was inevitable.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Truth of Logical and Ethical Principles. Validity of Ideal of\\r\\nPerfection, but Impossibility of Deducing the Whole of Experience from\\r\\nit.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 211. But there is at least one further starting-point, the one\\r\\nadopted by the most subtle and elaborate of all reconstructive\\r\\nphilosophies. Logical necessities are as evidently real as bodies or\\r\\nselves. It is possible to define general types of inference, as well as\\r\\ncompact and internally necessary systems such as those of mathematics.\\r\\nThere is a perfectly distinguishable strain of pure rationality in the\\r\\nuniverse. Whether or not it be possible to conceive a pure rationality\\r\\nas self-subsistent, inasmuch as there are degrees it is at any rate\\r\\npossible to conceive of a maximum of rationality. But similarly there\\r\\nare degrees of moral goodness. It is possible to define with more or\\r\\nless exactness a morally perfect person, or an ideal moral community.\\r\\nHere again it may be impossible that pure and unalloyed goodness should\\r\\nconstitute a universe of itself. But that a maximum of goodness, with\\r\\nall of the accessories which it might involve, should be thus\\r\\nself-subsistent, is quite conceivable. It is thus possible to define an\\r\\nabsolute and perfect order, in which logical necessity, the interest of\\r\\nthought, or moral goodness, the interest of will, or both together,\\r\\nshould be realized to the maximum. Absolutism conceives reality under\\r\\nthe form of this ideal, and attempts to reconstruct experience\\r\\naccordingly. But is the prospect of success any better than in the cases\\r\\nof materialism and subjectivism? It is evident that the ideal of logical\\r\\nnecessity is due to the fact that certain parts of knowledge approach it\\r\\nmore closely than others. Thus mechanics contains more that is arbitrary\\r\\nthan mathematics, and mathematics more than logic. Similarly, the theory\\r\\nof the evolution of the planetary system, in that it requires the\\r\\nassumption of particular distances and particular masses for the parts\\r\\nof the primeval nebula, is more arbitrary than rational dynamics. It is\\r\\nimpossible, then, in view of the parts of knowledge which belong to the\\r\\nlower end of the scale of rationality, to regard reality as a whole as\\r\\nthe maximum of rationality; for either a purely dynamical, a purely\\r\\nmathematical, or a purely logical, realm would be more rational. The\\r\\nsimilar disproof of the moral perfection of reality is so unmistakable\\r\\nas to require no elucidation. It is evident that even where natural\\r\\nnecessities are not antagonistic to moral proprieties, they are at any\\r\\nrate indifferent to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Error and Evil Cannot be Reduced to the Ideal.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 212. But thus far no reference has been made to error and to evil.\\r\\nThese are the terms which the ideals of rationality and goodness must\\r\\nrepudiate if they are to retain their meaning. Nevertheless experience\\r\\ncontains them and psychology describes them. We have already followed\\r\\nthe efforts which absolute idealism has made to show that logical\\r\\nperfection requires error, and that moral perfection requires evil. Is\\r\\nit conceivable that such efforts should be successful? Suppose a higher\\r\\nlogic to make the principle of contradiction the very bond of\\r\\nrationality. What was formerly error is now indispensable to truth. But\\r\\nwhat of the new error--the unbalanced and mistaken thesis, the\\r\\nunresolved antithesis, the scattered and disconnected terms of thought?\\r\\nThese fall outside the new truth as surely as the old error fell outside\\r\\nthe old truth. And the case of moral goodness is precisely parallel. The\\r\\nhigher goodness may be so defined as to require failure and sin. Thus it\\r\\nmay be maintained that there can be no true success without struggle,\\r\\nand no true spiritual exaltation except through repentance. But what of\\r\\nfailure unredeemed, sin unrepented, evil uncompensated and unresolved?\\r\\nNothing has been gained after all but a new definition of goodness--and\\r\\na new definition of evil. And this is an ethical, not a metaphysical\\r\\nquestion. The problem of evil, like the problem of error, is as far from\\r\\nsolution as ever. Indeed, the very urgency of these problems is due to\\r\\nmetaphysical absolutism. For this philosophy defines the universe as a\\r\\nperfect unity. Measured by the standard of such an ideal universe, the\\r\\nparts of finite experience take on a fragmentary and baffling character\\r\\nwhich they would not otherwise possess. The absolute perfection must by\\r\\ndefinition both determine and exclude the imperfect. Thus absolutism\\r\\nbankrupts the universe by holding it accountable for what it can never\\r\\npay.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Collective Character of the Universe as a Whole.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 213. If the attempt to construct experience in the special terms of\\r\\nsome part of experience be abandoned, how is reality to be defined? It\\r\\nis evident that in that case there can be no definition of reality as\\r\\nsuch. It must be regarded as a collection of all elements, relations,\\r\\nprinciples, systems, that compose it. All truths will be true of it, and\\r\\nit will be the subject of all truths. Reality is at least physical,\\r\\npsychical, moral, and rational. That which is physical is not\\r\\nnecessarily moral or psychical, but may be either or both of these. Thus\\r\\nit is a commonplace of experience that what has bulk and weight may or\\r\\nmay not be good, and may or may not be known. Similarly, that which is\\r\\npsychical may or may not be physical, moral, or rational; and that which\\r\\nis moral or rational may or may not be physical and psychical. There is,\\r\\nthen, an indeterminism in the universe, a mere coincidence of\\r\\nprinciples, in that it contains physical, psychical, moral, logical\\r\\norders, without being in all respects either a physical, a psychical, a\\r\\nmoral, or a logical necessity.[420:13] Reality or experience itself is\\r\\nneutral in the sense of being exclusively predetermined by no one of the\\r\\nseveral systems it contains. But the different systems of experience\\r\\nretain their specific and proper natures, without the compromise which\\r\\nis involved in all attempts to extend some one until it shall embrace\\r\\nthem all. If such a universe seems inconceivably desultory and chaotic,\\r\\none may always remind one\\'s self by directly consulting experience that\\r\\nit is not only found immediately and unreflectively, but returned to and\\r\\nlived in after every theoretical excursion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: Moral Implications of such a Pluralistic Philosophy. Purity\\r\\nof the Good.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 214. But what implications for life would be contained in such a\\r\\nphilosophy? Even if it be theoretically clarifying, through being\\r\\nhospitable to all differences and adequate to the multifarious demands\\r\\nof experience, is it not on that very account morally dreary and\\r\\nstultifying? Is not its refusal to establish the universe upon moral\\r\\nfoundations destructive both of the validity of goodness, and of the\\r\\nincentive to its attainment? Certainly not--if the validity of goodness\\r\\nbe determined by criteria of worth, and if the incentive to goodness be\\r\\nthe possibility of making that which merely exists, or is necessary,\\r\\nalso good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis philosophy does not, it is true, define the good, but it makes\\r\\nethics autonomous, thus distinguishing the good which it defines, and\\r\\nsaving it from compromise with matter-of-fact, and logical or mechanical\\r\\nnecessity. The criticism of life is founded upon an independent basis,\\r\\nand affords justification, of a selective and exclusive moral idealism.\\r\\nJust because it is not required that the good shall be held accountable\\r\\nfor whatever is real, the ideal can be kept pure and intrinsically\\r\\nworthy. The analogy of logic is most illuminating. If it be insisted\\r\\nthat whatever exists is logically necessary, logical necessity must be\\r\\nmade to embrace that from which it is distinguished by definition, such\\r\\nas contradiction, mere empirical existence, and error. The consequence\\r\\nis a logical chaos which has in truth forfeited the name of logic.\\r\\nSimilarly a goodness defined to make possible the deduction from it of\\r\\nmoral evil or moral indifference loses the very distinguishing\\r\\nproperties of goodness. The consequence is an ethical neutrality which\\r\\ninvalidates the moral will. A metaphysical neutrality, on the other\\r\\nhand, although denying that reality as such is predestined to\\r\\nmorality--and thus affording no possibility of an ethical\\r\\nabsolutism--becomes the true ground for an ethical purism.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Incentive to Goodness.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 215. But, secondly, there can be no lack of incentive to goodness in a\\r\\nuniverse which, though not all-good, is in no respect incapable of\\r\\nbecoming good. That which is mechanically or logically necessary, and\\r\\nthat which is psychically present, _may be good_. And what can the\\r\\nrealization of goodness mean if not that what is natural and necessary,\\r\\nactual and real, shall be also good. The world is not good, will not be\\r\\ngood, merely through being what it is, but is or shall be made good\\r\\nthrough the accession of goodness. It is this belief that the real is\\r\\nnot necessarily, but may be, good; that the ideal is not necessarily,\\r\\nbut may be, realized; which has inspired every faith in action.\\r\\nPhilosophically it is only a question of permitting such faith to be\\r\\nsincere, or condemning it as shallow. If the world be made good through\\r\\ngood-will, then the faith of moral action is rational; but if the world\\r\\nbe good because whatever is must be good, then moral action is a\\r\\ntread-mill, and its attendant and animating faith only self-deception.\\r\\nMoral endeavor is the elevation of physical and psychical existence to\\r\\nthe level of goodness.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Relate the inheritance to life, convert the tradition into a\\r\\n     servant of character, draw upon the history for support in the\\r\\n     struggles of the spirit, declare a war of extermination\\r\\n     against the total evil of the world; and then raise new armies\\r\\n     and organize into fighting force every belief available in the\\r\\n     faith that has descended to you.\"[423:14]\\r\\n\\r\\nEvil is here a practical, not a theoretical, problem. It is not to be\\r\\nsolved by thinking it good, for to think it good is to deaden the very\\r\\nnerve of action; but by destroying it and replacing it with good.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Justification of Faith.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 216. The justification of faith is in the promise of reality. For\\r\\nwhat, after all, would be the meaning of a faith which declares that all\\r\\nthings, good, bad, and indifferent, are everlastingly and necessarily\\r\\nwhat they are--even if it were concluded on philosophical grounds to\\r\\ncall that ultimate necessity good. Faith has interests; faith is faith\\r\\n_in_ goodness or beauty. Then what more just and potent cause of despair\\r\\nthan the thought that the ideal must be held accountable for error,\\r\\nugliness, and evil, or for the indifferent necessities of\\r\\nnature?[424:15] Are ideals to be prized the less, or believed in the\\r\\nless, when there is no ground for their impeachment? How much more\\r\\nhopeful for what is worth the hoping, that nature should discern ideals\\r\\nand take some steps toward realizing them, than that ideals should have\\r\\ncreated nature--such as it is! How much better a report can we give of\\r\\nnature for its ideals, than of the ideals for their handiwork, if it be\\r\\nnature! Emerson writes:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Suffice it for the joy of the universe that we have not\\r\\n     arrived at a wall, but at interminable oceans. Our life seems\\r\\n     not present so much as prospective; not for the affairs on\\r\\n     which it is wasted, but as a hint of this vast-flowing vigor.\\r\\n     Most of life seems to be mere advertisement of faculty;\\r\\n     information is given us not to sell ourselves cheap; that we\\r\\n     are very great. So, in particulars, our greatness is always in\\r\\n     a tendency or direction, not in an action. It is for us to\\r\\n     believe in the rule, not in the exception. The noble are thus\\r\\n     known from the ignoble. So in accepting the leading of the\\r\\n     sentiments, it is not what we believe concerning the\\r\\n     immortality of the soul or the like, but _the universal\\r\\n     impulse to believe_, that is the material circumstance and is\\r\\n     the principal fact in the history of the globe.\"[425:16]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Worship and Service of God.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 217. If God be rid of the imputation of moral evil and indifference,\\r\\nhe may be _intrinsically worshipful_, because regarded under the form of\\r\\nthe highest ideals. And if the great cause of goodness be in fact at\\r\\nstake, God may both command the adoration of men through his purity, and\\r\\nre\\xc3\\xabnforce their virtuous living through representing to them that\\r\\nrealization of goodness in the universe at large which both contains and\\r\\nexceeds their individual endeavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Philosopher and the Standards of the Marketplace.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 218. Bishop Berkeley wrote in his \"Commonplace Book\":\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"My speculations have the same effect as visiting foreign\\r\\n     countries: in the end I return where I was before, but my\\r\\n     heart at ease, and enjoying life with new satisfaction.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it be essential to the meaning of philosophy that it should issue\\r\\nfrom life, it is equally essential that it should return to life. But\\r\\nthis connection of philosophy with life does not mean its reduction to\\r\\nthe terms of life as conceived in the market-place. Philosophy cannot\\r\\nemanate from life, and quicken life, without elevating and ennobling it,\\r\\nand will therefore always be incommensurable with life narrowly\\r\\nconceived. Hence the philosopher must always be as little understood by\\r\\nmen of the street as was Thales by the Thracian handmaiden. He has an\\r\\ninnocence and a wisdom peculiar to his perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"When he is reviled, he has nothing personal to say in answer\\r\\n     to the civilities of his adversaries, for he knows no scandals\\r\\n     of anyone, and they do not interest him; and therefore he is\\r\\n     laughed at for his sheepishness; and when others are being\\r\\n     praised and glorified, he cannot help laughing very sincerely\\r\\n     in the simplicity of his heart; and this again makes him look\\r\\n     like a fool. When he hears a tyrant or king eulogized, he\\r\\n     fancies that he is listening to the praises of some keeper of\\r\\n     cattle--a swineherd, or shepherd, or cowherd, who is being\\r\\n     praised for the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them;\\r\\n     and he remarks that the creature whom they tend, and out of\\r\\n     whom they squeeze the wealth, is of a less tractable and more\\r\\n     insidious nature. Then, again, he observes that the great man\\r\\n     is of necessity as ill-mannered and uneducated as any\\r\\n     shepherd, for he has no leisure, and he is surrounded by a\\r\\n     wall, which is his mountain-pen. Hearing of enormous landed\\r\\n     proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our philosopher\\r\\n     deems this to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed to\\r\\n     think of the whole earth; and when they sing the praises of\\r\\n     family, and say that some one is a gentleman because he has\\r\\n     had seven generations of wealthy ancestors, he thinks that\\r\\n     their sentiments only betray the dulness and narrowness of\\r\\n     vision of those who utter them, and who are not educated\\r\\n     enough to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man\\r\\n     has had thousands and thousands of progenitors, and among them\\r\\n     have been rich and poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and\\r\\n     barbarians, many times over.\"[427:17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not to be expected that the opinion of the \"narrow, keen, little,\\r\\nlegal mind\" should appreciate the philosophy which has acquired the\\r\\n\"music of speech,\" and hymns \"the true life which is lived by immortals\\r\\nor men blessed of heaven.\" Complacency cannot understand reverence, nor\\r\\nsecularism, religion.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Secularism of the Present Age.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 219. If we may believe the report of a contemporary philosopher, the\\r\\npresent age is made insensible to the meaning of life through\\r\\npreoccupation with its very achievements:\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"The world of finite interests and objects has rounded itself,\\r\\n     as it were, into a separate whole, within which the mind of\\r\\n     man can fortify itself, and live _securus adversus deos_, in\\r\\n     independence of the infinite. In the sphere of _thought_,\\r\\n     there has been forming itself an ever-increasing body of\\r\\n     science, which, tracing out the relation of finite things to\\r\\n     finite things, never finds it necessary to seek for a\\r\\n     beginning or an end to its infinite series of phenomena, and\\r\\n     which meets the claims of theology with the saying of the\\r\\n     astronomer, \\'I do not need that hypothesis.\\' In the sphere of\\r\\n     _action_, again, the complexity of modern life presents a\\r\\n     thousand isolated interests, crossing each other in ways too\\r\\n     subtle to trace out--interests commercial, social, and\\r\\n     political--in pursuing one or other of which the individual\\r\\n     may find ample occupation for his existence, without ever\\r\\n     feeling the need of any return upon himself, or seeing any\\r\\n     reason to ask himself whether this endless striving has any\\r\\n     meaning or object beyond itself.\"[428:18]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sidenote: The Value of Contemplation for Life.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 220. There is no dignity in living except it be in the solemn presence\\r\\nof the universe; and only contemplation can summon such a presence.\\r\\nMoreover, the sessions must be not infrequent, for memory is short and\\r\\nvisions fade. Truth does not require, however, to be followed out of the\\r\\nworld. There is a speculative detachment from life which is less\\r\\ncourageous, even if more noble, than worldliness. Such is Dante\\'s\\r\\nexalted but medi\\xc3\\xa6val intellectualism.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"And it may be said that (as true friendship between men\\r\\n     consists in each wholly loving the other) the true philosopher\\r\\n     loves every part of wisdom, and wisdom every part of the\\r\\n     philosopher, inasmuch as she draws all to herself, and allows\\r\\n     no one of his thoughts to wander to other things.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though, as Aristotle thought, pure contemplation be alone proper to\\r\\nthe gods in their perfection and blessedness, for the sublunary world\\r\\nthis is less worthy than that balance and unity of faculty which\\r\\ndistinguished the humanity of the Greek.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Then,\" writes Thucydides, \"we are lovers of the beautiful,\\r\\n     yet simple in our tastes, and we cultivate the mind without\\r\\n     loss of manliness. Wealth we employ, not for talk and\\r\\n     ostentation, but when there is a real use for it. To avoid\\r\\n     poverty with us is no disgrace; the true disgrace is in doing\\r\\n     nothing to avoid it. An Athenian citizen does not neglect the\\r\\n     State because he takes care of his own household; and even\\r\\n     those of us who are engaged in business have a very fair idea\\r\\n     of politics. We alone regard a man who takes no interest in\\r\\n     public affairs not as a harmless, but as a useless character;\\r\\n     and if few of us are originators, we are all sound judges, of\\r\\n     a policy. The great impediment to action is, in our opinion,\\r\\n     not discussion, but the want of that knowledge which is gained\\r\\n     by discussion preparatory to action. For we have a peculiar\\r\\n     power of thinking before we act, and of acting too, whereas\\r\\n     other men are courageous from ignorance, but hesitate upon\\r\\n     reflection.\"[429:19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus life may be broadened and deepened without being made thin and\\r\\nineffectual. As the civil community is related to the individual\\'s\\r\\nprivate interests, so the community of the universe is related to the\\r\\ncivil community. There is a citizenship in this larger community which\\r\\nrequires a wider and more generous interest, rooted in a deeper and more\\r\\nquiet reflection. The world, however, is not to be left behind, but\\r\\nserved with a new sense of proportion, with the peculiar fortitude and\\r\\nreverence which are the proper fruits of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"This is that which will indeed dignify and exalt knowledge,\\r\\n     if contemplation and action may be more nearly and straitly\\r\\n     conjoined and united together than they have been; a\\r\\n     conjunction like unto that of the two highest planets: Saturn,\\r\\n     the planet of rest and contemplation, and Jupiter, the planet\\r\\n     of civil society and action.\"[430:20]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFOOTNOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n[402:1] Cf.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\r\\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\r\\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\ncollection.

LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right\\r\\nof Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\r\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\r\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\\r\\nwith this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\\r\\npromotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\\r\\nharmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\\r\\nthat arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\\r\\nor cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nwork, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\\r\\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and official\\r\\npage at http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\\r\\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n']"
